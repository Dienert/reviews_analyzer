txpenelope,3,Good but not like Talking To Strangers,"This was a very interesting audiobook. Gladwell looks at success through a different lens.  He examines success not just by hard work but by timing. Gladwell explains the 10,000 hour rule - it takes 10,000 hours of intense practice to become an expert at something. 

But success is also a product of timing. The majority of professional hockey players are born at the beginning months of the year coinciding with the youth league age cutoff. Wealthiest men of the Industrial Age are born within 10 years. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, & Bill Joi born within months of each other. 

Gladwell also examines how culture plays a part of success too. However, I felt that Chapter 7 on plane crashes which examines cultural reasons for communication breakdowns during flight emergencies didn’t really fit into this book about “success.”

After reading Gladwell’s book Talking to Strangers, this book was a bit of a disappointment. Overall it’s a good book but not at the same caliber as Talking to Strangers.",2021-04-02T15:48:44.000+00:00

It changed my perspective on the idea of success, and how to obtain it. A LOT of the factors within the journey are circumstantial, and others require hard work. Gladwell, presents the beauty of that conflicting path to success.",2017-03-22T09:21:10.000+00:00

I really thought that the cliche story of success had some truth in it, but apparently I was wrong. According to reviews like Rebecca on Goodreads, who said, “My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis,” this theory of Gladwell’s is very true. My only criticism is the lack of female representation by Gladwell. Allie from Goodreads agrees with me, saying, “Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem.” But overall. I thought the book was quite enjoyable and would recommend.",2017-03-21T00:12:36.000+00:00

It is difficult to analyze why and how distinguished people are so brilliant and superior, but the way that Gladwell presented his points gave a logical and tangible understanding  of the abstract concept of success. (Also, the amount of research he did is astonishing.)

I recommend this book to everyone!",2017-03-17T15:42:15.000+00:00
