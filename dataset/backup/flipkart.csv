Dhruv Sharma,4,Phenomenal,"To describe it in one word ‚Äì Scintillating! In his provocative and inspiring book, Malcolm Gladwell talks about success and the underlying factors which propel one in the direction of achievement. Outliers promises to relate not just to your personal experiences but of those around you. He builds a convincing case for how successful people rise on a tide of advantages, ""some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky.""","Aug, 2017"
atin bajpai,5,Classy product,"Eye opener ,in simple words  books wants to say there are simple reasons for success and failure , life is simpler than we make it out be ,books just accentuates that, really worth a read ,will change your outlook towards life in a positive way !","Aug, 2017"
Sameer Saurabh,5,An answer to one of our unending questions,There are certain questions that repeatedly keep coming to our mind...perhaps one of them is what really makes a difference between a successful and unsuccessful person? This book tries to give an entirely different perspective on the above mentioned question. I believe it helps in understanding the interconnection between hard work and luck (can be defined here as inborn advantages) and the role that it can play in achieving success.,"Aug, 2017"
Shahzada Irfan Bashir,4,Very Good,"Must read book for everyone! It keeps you motivated with the purpose and skills you want to acquire. I loved this book throughout and it has a great connection. Don‚Äôt bother yourself with the difficult circumstance, you should keep going and excel yourself with the skills and follow your passion one day you will strike the target and achieve your goals. Must read for those who want to achieve something good in life and who dream big","Aug, 2017"
Mustufa Baldiwala,2,"Below Average..Success is not 'Circumstantial' Please, it is not Circumstantial.","Gladwell wants to say that success is largely dependent on Chance.. or in more common language ""Lucky Chance.""","Aug, 2017"

Nirbhay Modhe,4,A great literary experience.,"Outliers is a book centered around the statistical aspects of the lives of successful people. The author gives evidence of how certain factors contribute largely towards success in life. He gives examples of how the month of birth of ice hockey players affect their chances of becoming professional atheletes, how the year of birth affected Bill Gates' childhood and learning environment which ultimately played a key role in his success. The author mentions the 10,000 hour rule, which claims tha...","Feb, 2014"
Mohit Singh Solanki,4,Mindblowing!! Great work,"Outliers, published in 2008 is a research the writer has done on success of various people. He tries to find various answers like why people are there where they are now? Why someone is successful or not? etc. In Outliers he examines various general phenomena like high achievements, hard work and individual talent using his short, illustrative and self-engaging proofs and his quality to show complex things with simplicity. According to him hard work is always the main thing behind every succe...","Feb, 2014"

Gunjan gupta,4,The Differentitating Factor,This book gives us a new angle to look at life.

KAPIL ANEJA,4,good book describing what it takes to become really successful,"This is a book which would change your notions about success.

Sharan Aujla,5,Best Of Best,"This book is reallly amazing. I loved it. In this boook malcolam gladwell explains the clear difference between the sucessful people and non sucessful people.

Parth Shah,4,Brilliant read!,"Outliers is in general for all who like to figure out why they are where they are. Its an interested take on everybody around us. Malcolm Gladwell has done well to attribute all successes to not a singular parameter but rather to a series of events and incidents that happen to come together to form a larger chain leading up to the ""success"".","Dec, 2017"
Chinchu Thankachan,5,Master piece of Information analysis,Malcolm Gladwell has done an excellent job in conveying the secrets of success using parables from the real world. I especially liked the story of Airplane crashes and the deep seated study of the human factors involved in the accidents.,"Dec, 2017"
