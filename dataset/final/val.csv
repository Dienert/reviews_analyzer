One of the more interesting books I've ever read. Just finished Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers and it is by far one of the most interesting books I've ever read.,5
"Amazing!. My friend recommended this over a year ago and I just got around to reading it. It was such a great new way to look at how success is perceived in the sporting world, classrooms, and the world. Being a teacher, I thought it gave a great new way to look at how we give students opportunities to work hard and do well. Highly recommend!",5
"Complex interesting. A hard book to follow at times. With the inter weaving of how opportunities determination, luck culture contribute to life",4
Awesome!. Great book. I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's writing.,5
"Gladwell reads Gladwell. Malcolm Gladwell has a wonderful voice, as well as an interesting mind. While he focuses primarily on men, to my disappointment, Outliers is still worth a listen or two. I still like ""Blink"" best, but will definitely replay this book on my commute. Lots to think about.",5
"This will undoubtedly change a lot of your views. This book will show you what it truly takes to become successful, and you will definitely be surprised by what you find! I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to those with youth on their side, as you will quickly find out that time to hone a skill is one of the greatest advantages to becoming successful.",5
"very interesting book. I think that the book is quite interesting, that it has some insights worth considering. I have not finished the book yet though, so its conclusions and all I can not say if I agree or disagree with yet. I would like to see the resources and other materials of reference for the data though.",4
"Incredible. I loved this book! Not only is it a joy to listen to Malcolm Gladwell but the subject matter is incredibly interesting and well thought out. I was surprised by this book. I knew that the story of success wasn’t a story of the individual, but of the circumstances that helped the individual get to where s/he was, but I didn’t realize how much culture came into play. Really extraordinary. I’m a new big fan!",5
"Another merry romp through the social sciences with profound conclusions.. Outliers is classic Gladwell. Well researched, impeccably storied and logically concluded. He takes us on journey after journey relating facts and experiences and tying them together in fresh ways to achieve new understanding of the complexities of life. Some are deceptively simple - you need 10000 hours of practice at anything to be truly proficient. Some more complex - cultural differences have huge bearing on how good you are at something. I loved it. It made me think and change my perceptions of schooling, genius and hard work. Thoroughly recommended.",5
"Just buy the book!. An outstanding book that I would recommend to everyone - adults and teenagers. Everyone in my family is reading it. The insights the book highlights are simple now that someone has done the research to point them out. Enough said, buy the darn book and read it.",5
"Fascinating Read. I have loaned my copy and purchased more copies of this book for many friends. It's a quick, fascinating subject and certainly makes one think. I recommend it!",5
"This shaped Shawn White the olympians career. I bought this book because Sean white has been an idol of mine since child hood and in Tim Ferris’ tribe of mentors, Shawn white proclaimed that this book had a huge impact on his career, he was a major influence in my life, I had the 2005 burton Shawn white snowboard, so I had to pick it up and gain the same insights he did, it’s a great read and If you’re going to read anything pick this up over the rest, it’s so diverse and you’ll touch on so many topics out of your regular zone of thinking it’s a very thought provoking book.",5
Inspirational. Great viewpoint of what may make someone successful. Great read for someone who enjoys self help books. You'll enjoy the side stories.,5
A good read but I think the author is overly adept .... A good read but I think the author is overly adept at synthesis and making connections that might be a little far fetched. Thought provoking and worth a read though.,4
The Truth Is Outlier. This is my first non-fiction review.,3
"Another Excellent Book by Gladwell!. Gladwell is am amazing storyteller and theorist. I purchased Outliners after a stranger in a bookstore found me perusing Blink and told me three times I needed to read this book. I'm so glad I listened. Not only does Gladwell examine the formula behind success differently, but he explains it in detail. Some things can't be changed, but others are still within ones ability to influence. Highly Recommended!",5
Great listen... This has changed my perspective very differently..,5
"Five Stars. A Must-read for anyone enjoying life and bringing up children or grand-children. Well researched and written so that it is interesting and fun to read. Malcolm Gladwell tells his facts like stories in an easy and attractive way. One is left at the end of the last chapter having learned a whole lot of things and wanting more. So what did I do? - I went back and read most of it again, just for the sheer joy of reading well-written stuff.",5
"Forget statistics. Read it for what it is.. I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.",5
Hshssjebhss. HI,5
"Excellent Read!. What’s an amazing book, very insightful and thought provoking. A must read for all ages.",5
"Fun read. I enjoyed this read. It's reasonably light, not packed with important academic studies or applications. But the stories are fun and point toward valuable insights that you will find applicable to everyday life.",5
Must read. Must read,5
good ideas terrible book. good for people who want reasons to justify there failures. would not recommend this book.,1
Buy it!. Love this book - explains the difference between what makes someone successful to the T,5
Exceptional reading. If you're a fan of Gladwell (and/or ice hockey) you will love this book. Fascinating stories of how some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs grew to become who they are today.,5
Eh..... This book was okay for awhile. I got bored with it halfway through. I suppose it's a philosopher type of thing.,2
"Grossly overrated. I read the entire thing just to make sure I knew exactly how unfulfilling it truly was. There were maybe a few pages worth keeping in mind. The moral of the author's entire point is......sometimes people achieve success because of things that happened to them in life. Literally, go take the bus and have a conversation with any stranger and you'll find that to be more rewarding of an experience. I can't believe it has such an astounding reputation. I'm sorry for being harsh but there a better ways to spend your time than this reading book.",1
"Wow. This book was fascinating and having started three businesses, I found that the theories/statistics/stories are helpful to a wide range of business people.",5
"great listen, really enjoyed the narrative. As a Seattlite and a hockey player with a September birthday I could relate to the information and the narrative.",5
easy to use. just the ticket,5
amazing book concept. life success is explained!. I was totally overtaken. I would like to see more chapters about outliers out there,5
Great book!. This book was recommended to me by my manager and I found it to be a great mind opener book that gives you a new angle to success.,4
"Great glimpse into a world we live in that we never really see.... Thoughtful, compelling, real, and vivid... I was recommended this book so many times, and I'm really glad I finally read it. It made me see things that I've looked at a million times so differently! I really love his books and honestly, his writing is worth the trendy praise. It's a quick read and absolutely worth it.",5
Thought provoking. This book provides a lot of food for thought. Outliers is written so even my parents can understand and appreciate the principles surrounding hard work and opportunity it discusses.,4
"Outliers review. I purchased this book for my son's 11th grade summer reading for school. My son says this book is hard to follow, mostly because it tells different stories of peoples success, but has no continual story line. He really doesn't enjoy reading this book.",3
"Fascinating reading.. I found this book most interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think ""outside"" the box - no pun intended.",5
Four Stars. no issues,4
"Inspiring but wrong. This is an entertaining (and somewhat convincing) book. However, when you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that most of Gladwell's work has been discredited by science and has no more bearing on Psychology than one's astrological sign.",2
Five Stars. Wow...this is an exckent book,5
"It is easy to see why The Outliers. It is easy to see why The Outliers, The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell was the number one national best seller. This book includes remarkable stories that I found fascinating and inspiring. This book is about many different people and stories from different walks of life and how they were able to find success. Malcolm Gladwell explored how culture, family, opportunities, and time periods shaped some of the most successful people. This is a very enjoyable, easy to follow, and relatable book that I loved to read.",5
A must read!. Facts and numbers never lies.,5
"Second Time I bought this book !!. This is the Second time I have bought this book. The first book was borrowed from me before I even finished it..... it made its way thru the family and now is being passed around to friends. ""Outliers"" is marvelous, and I can well understand why it has stayed on the best seller list for so long. This book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell, and now I look for everything he writes. I will start reading this again, from the beginning, and with any luck will be able to finish it before someone borrows this copy, too !!",5
"Interesting but pointless information. I have enjoyed MG’s books before but I fail to take away any real and meaningful value from this text. Outliers discusses why some are famous, wealthy, expert etc. First you’re led to believe the infamous 10,000 hours is all you need but then you realize the real controls on your success are out of your control.",2
great. An exceptional book- hard to put down. Enjoyed it,5
"GREAT READ. THIS IS A THOUGHT PROVOKING BOOK FILLED WITH LOTS OF FACTS. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO READ THREW IT, AND LOVED IT!",5
Product matched description. Product matched description,5
"Think Again. This book will make you think again about stories of success. If you're in the business of education or coaching, this book will change the way you approach the process.",5
Fantastic book!. My husband and I both loved this book! It's full of fascinating information and what it takes to be truly successful at anything.,5
"Great book, very deep and relative to society now.. I gave this to my Marines as a gift, for earning a promotion. Certainly a great read. I recommend any newly promoted Marine to read it as well as any young man and woman.",5
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Easy to read book, well researched and a page turner. Uses world class examples that everyone can relate to and people who we all know. Absolutely love it! I particularly liked all the research that went into it without it being too high brow a book. 💯",5
"Very informative. ""Outliers"" is very informative. In a few chapters I could relate to the experiences of people who I know personally as well as to those of my own. The chapter of 10,000 hours is especially significant because of projects I have undergone myself in which it has taken as much time to be acknowledged by others in proficiency.",4
Thank you. Thank you,5
Ok book. This was much different than I expected. I can see some relevance but not all in on some of his assumptions.,3
Coming back to point after dissapoinment by Blink. I have been reading Gladwell systematically in past. He is certainly author of great talent to tell interesting stories with serious message attached to it.,4
"Excellent read. I know the author is drawing some interesting characteristics together, but seems like when you were born has as much to do with ""success"" and opportunity as hard work and a good mind. Fascinating stories and comparisons.",5
"Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell. The author combines the envious theory of socialism, mixed with self guilt, adds a dash of interesting stories and comes up with a transparent, flat manifesto of ""Free Societies are Fake"". He leads with a story of how the DOB of kids in elite Canadian hockey predicates their success. It hooks the reader. The story has merit and is interesting. There are a couple more catchy tales like the Montana rancher vs. Oppenhiemer and the Chinese rice farmer and rationale how the Chinese language is better for math. After these however it becomes clear that Mr. Gladwell wrote this book to push his beliefs that socialism is far superior a free society. Mr. Gladwell, IT HAS BEEN TRIED and failed all over the world. Eventually you simply out of other people's money to spent. The idea that there could have been hundreds or thousands of Bill Gates' if computers would have been supplied to everyone is purely a utopian pipe drem but it is an approach Socialists have asserted many times throughout history. One of the key elements the author chooses to exclude are the choices people make. Granted, if every person would have made the same choices as Bill Gates when afforded the use of computers then there would have been more Bill Gates' but we are talking about living breathing human beings and it simply doesn't translate. Choices are a much more important component in a free society than in a socialism/communism. The author's rhetoric really only accomplishes 2 things. Number one, it decreases his feelings of self guilt for being born into a ""privileged and entitled"" family. Quite simply, it makes him feel better about himself and number two it improves his public appearance by using his ""entitlement and privilege"" for the good of all those less fortunate. Again, an attempt to make himself feel better.  It is clear that you despise the thought that a person can be independent. I don't know where or why you have formed these concepts but I bet it is a product of how YOUR surroundings have influenced YOU. I gave your book 5 stars for the specific stories you tell but had to subtract three stars for the way you use them to justify the worn out idea of Socialism. I hope you will take all the money you make from you book sales and use it top make your self feel better because you are such a good person you deserve to feel good about yourself...in fact you are entitled to it.",2
"Fun anecdotal book which gives pause for thought.. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell, though find it important to take his writing for what it is: as an inspiration to think along his lines. His books tend to be somewhat drawn out, with long anecdotes to support his claims. Although somewhat tedious at times, they serve to help the reader remember his key points.",4
"Good ""article"". Well-written, as all his books are. I would have preferred a denser, shorter read to get through all the cool ideas. not sure I needed last chapter on his own background.",4
"Interesting and Meaningful. ""Outliers"" is an interesting, meaningful and well-written book. The stories/vignettes covered by Malcolm Gladwell cast a unique, and often unexpected, light on a wide array of topics, such as education, technology and airplane accidents, among others.",5
Success awaits. Can't wait to dive into this one!,5
"Redundant. Most of it is common sense. Makes a lot of analogies to back up a point that no one really argued with. He has good points, but 99% of the book is telling stories of people that fit his point, instead of actually talking about the point. This book could have had a lot more content than it did.",3
This book decodes our world. Every chapter delivers insight into why we are where we are by examining the most successful of us. it's comforting to know why we succeed and to what and whom we owe our particular opportunities. I'm about to listen to this again. an amazing book!,5
"Lucid and Entertaining. This and an additional title, Cradle to Cradle, were compelling listening. This book initially talks about the source of success but the thought provoking information goes much further. Read this for light entertainment or for much deeper reflection - it has the uncanny ability to reach eash of us where we are.",4
Thought provoking. Very in depth and it challenges your preconceived notions of success,5
If you believe you've failed in life - Outliers just might change your mind!. This is a thought provoking book with very clever research and analysis. However still trying to decide how much was spin versus objectivity. A must read - certainly a different perspective on the world of success.,5
Five Stars. Another insightful look at ordinary life by Malcom Gladwell,5
"free state books US is a good distributor. free state books US is a good distributor: got my copy w very little markings, only signs of age, air exposure to the pages i bet. it had been in a library.",5
Incredibly Compiled. This was such an informative book. At no point did I ever want to put this book down. I felt myself gaining knowledge from every page. A must read.,4
Awesome. Malcolm Gladwell is a phenomenal writer. The book is insightful on how one's environment and community can/has dictated many people¿s successes. An easy read; eye opening experience.,5
"This Book is an Outlier of Extraordinary Insight. Listening to Gladwell read his own words is a gift. He speaks conversationally, with passion and ease. This book broke my heart several times over; to understand how access to opportunity, cultural legacy, and birth dates affects the lives of generations of people. For me this book was profoundly personal and motivating.",5
Another Great Title from Malcolm. Malcolm is a great story teller and this book doesn't disappoint. His ideas on this book are spot on and very interesting. They bring a fresh perspective on what drives success and I must say I agree with most of what he presents. I've recommended this book to quiet of friends already.,5
"The sin of self regard. The subtitle could have been ""The Sin of Self Regard"". Much of who we are consist of factors completely out of our control, birth month, birth year, ethnic background and other such items. Gladwell is an expert at explaining a theme by using anecdotal stories and explaining the results by looking at the story from a different perspective.",4
"Very interesting and thought provoking book. I liked that it went behind the curtain as it were of ""success"" stories and looked at the many fascinating things that contribute to that. The stories that illustrate were particularly useful and illuminating. Or more precisely the outlier stories. As they were not all about success. A case in point being the Korean airlines bad safely record in the 90's as an outlier.",4
Powerful. I think this book may be a game changer for me. Not in any obvious or spectacular way but it certainly has given me a different way to look at the world. It’s not that the information is new but it’s the kind of stories that you’ve always heard or thought you’ve heard but just didn’t have the words or the back story to put it all together in your thoughts. It gives a clear space to see these stories through.,5
"Five Stars. Awesome, Awesome book. David & Goliath is great also.",5

"Good book that talks about why people are successful, all the id. Good book that talks about why people are successful, all the ideas he proposed are logical and followed up with many proofs.",5
Five Stars. decent book,5
"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",4
"Edward Zivica author of Whispering Whale e-book Amazon. As an old man and not a successful one, I have taken notice of how successful people have achieved their greatness. This book enhances my belief that life is predestined. We are what we are, because it was meant to be that way. This book points out that phenomenon. I do not believe in luck. EZ the novel Whispering Whale at Amazon",5
"A Newer Perspective. Malcolm Gladwell gives his readers a brand new and better perspective on phenomena which we thought we already understood (but didn't). I really didn't know that geniuses also have to work hard to perfect their areas of genius. Gladwell shows us that anyone who wishes to do great things must put in his or her 10,000 hours of sweat. Bravo!!!",5
"WOW!!!. This is a very very very special book that puts so much clarity, so eloquently, on such complexity. Truly magical!",5
"Three Stars. Good read, some basic information in some sections.",3
Outliers. I got this book for a class. I really enjoyed it and I ended up getting Malcolm Gladwell's other 2 books.,4
"Perfect. Perfect……But I just started reading, why do you force me to write a comment? My friend recommend this book for me, and it seems it's an interesting book with very different views.",5
"Motivating, well written, interesting book. I think it is a motivating book. Well written, interesting. I enjoyed reading it. Good examples of the main subjet.",4
"Good but not great. Tipping Point and Blink were a much better read then this latest effort from Gladwell. Still, I enjoy his incredible research!",4
Gladwell is always derply thought provoking!. Gladwell has a gift in challenging are superficial understanding of things that have deep historical and societal importance.,5
"If you want to know the real 'why' behind success .... If you want to know the real 'why' behind success, this is at least an essential piece of the answer.",5
"000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. In my opinion, all of the teenagers should read this book. In one book Malcolm Gladwell put the years of life experiences of very successful people in this country and abroad. He showed how important to work your 10.000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. You can be born a genius, but you'd accomplish nothing, if you won't work hard, but if you are working hard and long hours, the success would come to you. I appreciate meticulous, hard job Malcolm Gladwell put in this book.",5
Gladwell's least impressive work. Tipping point was amazing. Blink was really great. Outliers is... an interesting collection of information without a lot of practical use and application - especially when you justapose this work with his other books.,2
Five Stars. ⭐️,5
"Retrospective piece about Cultural Legacies. This is a book that I am glad I pushed through to the end. The ending of this book brought everything in the previous chapters together. As an educator, I found myself nodding, agreeing and enlightened from chapters 8 until the end of the book. This book shows the bigger picture of how people and for what reasons they find success. I will probably go back and reread Chapter 8 and 9. Most relatable and interesting parts of the book.",5
"Well written.. I find that Mr. Gladwell writes another enticing book. I actually spent an entire day reading all the way through his third book, and to no surprise, it was one of the best reads of 2008. I actually suggested the book to one of my teachers, and she now plans to a project with next year's students in conjunction with the book. She even went about purchasing all three of Mr. Gladwell's books. It is easy to say that Mr. Gladwell will be, if he is not already, one of the best writers of our generation.",5
very nice book. This is a book that really worth to read!,5
Motivational. I truly enjoyed this book and have recommended it several times.,5
"Fun. Come on... It's great. Book Candy and sometimes a hoot. Sometime a ""?"""" but always Gladwell. Love it. More please!",4
"You May Be Changed After Reading This Book. It is apparent in this day and age that ""ego"" and ""self-made men"" are still intertwined. Moreover, ""success"" is still defined by many",5
Good read. Good read,5
"Great Insight into Success. Gladwell's paints a picture to describe success that follows a different narrative than the traditional tale.  There are some fascinating conclusions about the impact of environment.  With that said, I think he dismisses, personal vision and the extent to which some people maximize their opportunities versus others. The people in his narrative fully explored/exploited those opportunities, but dismissing missed opportunities is careless.  Its just impossible to write a book about the innovations unrealized from the lack of vision or persistence because we never have the innovation to marvel upon.  Instead we can only deconstruct the product of the extreme success.  His points on cultural legacy seem very good.  Great read!",5
One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people. One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people,5
Five Stars. Great Book!,5
Awesome book. Outliers is a must read.,5
"simple but powerful. Why do some people achieve great things? It's not all to do with talent, there are so many other factors that make this possible. This book looks at why some people do well and what other factors are involved",5
Three Stars. didn't read the book. so gave it midway review,3
Read For a Class. The book is very interesting. It is full of interesting facts. Wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't for my class.,4
Great Book. Thought provoking and a must read!. This book will open your thought process to truly understand people and their connection with society and their history. Brillant read.,5
This is a great book in my opinion. I could not put this down. This is a great book in my opinion. The only slow spot for me was about the Korean airlines.,5
"Brilliant research, biased conclusion. What a wonderful compilation of research, filled with psychological and sociological truths, and presented in a way that yields understanding of complex topics. I love how he demonstrates the 3 elements required for success and how these elements apply to success in any endeavour.",3
"Always interesting. This latest is as interesting as Blink and Tipping Point. I found the chapter on education (chapter 9) to be an unexpected surprise. Also, chapter 5's discussion about the impact of demographic trough was fascinating for me, a late baby boomer. Overall, I appreciate MG's thesis: that ""success is not a random act [but] arises out of a predictible and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities."" (p. 155) The variety of examples that MG uses to illustrate his theories in all three of his books broadens his appeal and ""buy-in"" for his ideas. His writing style is plain-spoken, straight- forward. Always interesting...food for thought.",5
Cheese. Cheese,3
Five Stars. CLASSIC BOOK!!,5
"Outliers is Outstanding!. In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary. He proposes that 10,000 hours of practice make us outstanding; that's why The Beatles -who played on stage in Hamburg for 270 days, 8 hours a day make their special sound, or why the Hockey players born in january-febraury had more chances of make it to NHL (because they are closer to start date). Very interesting, but it could be called ""The 10,000 hours rule to be an outlier.",5
"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.",4
Excelente !!. A different point of view about success ... and the causes of it as we have never heard before. Looking forward to read the next book of this author.,5
"Recommended for any parent .. I recommend this for anyone with children.  This is a real eye open. The author is clear, distinct and gives great examples.   The examples converge to give a scientific like explanation. I think this is Malcolm&#8217;s best work.  I listened to the Tipping point which was also great but Outliers was much more interesting.   The audio quality was acceptable.",5
Must Read. By far the best book from Gladwell. Everything from here has been down hill. This is the only book of his I am glad I bought.,5
"Grossly overrated. I read the entire thing just to make sure I knew exactly how unfulfilling it truly was. There were maybe a few pages worth keeping in mind. The moral of the author's entire point is......sometimes people achieve success because of things that happened to them in life. Literally, go take the bus and have a conversation with any stranger and you'll find that to be more rewarding of an experience. I can't believe it has such an astounding reputation. I'm sorry for being harsh but there a better ways to spend your time than this reading book.",1
Cody. Boring,5
Highly recommended. I very much enjoyed this book. For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line. This book however brought home to me how much other unique (unique to them and their time) factors contributed greatly to their success. The stories about hockey players and how the slight difference in age gives the slightly older boy tremendous advantage were particularly enlightening.,4
"Good point. The book makes a great point and if you can internalize the point of feeling comfortable being different only to find success because of it later, it's great. Unfortunately the book moves extremely slow and it was difficult for me to remain interested in the numerous statistical examples that make the point. Good point nonetheless.",3
Five Stars. Very informative. Answers a lot of questions.,5
"A real page-turner. I was recommended this author, and I wanted to know more about how and why some people, over others, are successful and what deems 'success in life', so the combination of author and subject resulted in me not being able to book the book down. This well known author lives up to his worthy reputation with skilful writing backed up with exhaustive research and explanations.",5
"This is an amazing, and very interesting book. I had to read it. This is an amazing, and very interesting book. I had to read it for one of my college classes, and I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised, and everyone I've met who's read this book is impressed. It's worth reading. :)",5
I enjoyed it.. Very interesting book. I enjoyed it.,5
Good Read!. Great book! I read it and passed it to a friend!,5
"Great fast read. Similar to Gladwell's other books, it's thought provoking, interesting and fast paced. His unique and varied examples get you to think about your own potential. Definitely recommend.",5
Needs better glue. Great book! But some of the pages fell out over time,5
"A Must Read!. I have always been inquisitive about the lives of ones who make it to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the many other prestigious schools, the professional sport players, and the multi-making billionaires. For years, I stuck with the notion that they were just born this way with some unique, innate ability. I also viewed these individuals as &amp;ldquo;the lucky ones&amp;rdquo;; to me, these people came around every once in a while. Though just as I thought no ordinary person can achieve such a high status, Malcolm Gladwell proves me wrong. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell takes these common ideas and challenges each of them, showing society that the successful people aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;chosen ones&amp;rdquo; after all. hroughout the first couple of pages, Gladwell discusses the lives of professional hockey players. Almost everyone believes that they play at the pro level because they are just naturally good at the sport. However, through research, we learn that about 90 percent of these players are born sometime during the first four months of the year. Coincidence? No, this is rather the result of the cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada being January 1. &amp;ldquo;The benefit of critical extra months of maturity,&amp;rdquo; simply gives these individuals better coaching, much more practice then they would normally receive, and their teammates are ultimately better; this all allows them to eventually become professional players. Although talent is something greatly needed, it is not the major deciding factor in a player&amp;rsquo;s life. ext, Gladwell talks about Bill Gates and The Beatles, showing that their road to victory is not what we thought after all. We find out that they both accomplished 10,000 hours of practice at early ages; causing them to be the successful people we know them to be. Each of them was certainly gifted, but the extraordinary opportunities they faced are what differentiate between them. The Beatles were requested in Hamburg for the most casual reasons. Bill Gates just happened to be in a school known as Lakeside at the very right time. It is through the story of men like these and other people that I learned that we can never make it in this world alone; there are many factors that greatly affect our future. At the end of this part in the novel, Gladwell makes it clear that we should seize any opportunity, no matter how big or small, because that opportunity may be the one key to our triumph. Not only that, but an adversity can at times form into a huge opportunity. utliers even goes to argue that it matters where a pilot was born because that determines their success. He also argues the success of Asians at math in terms of how they grow up learning the subject. Gladwell tackles many topics and presents the flaws in society&amp;rsquo;s mindset in a very logical and sophisticated manner. All his ideas are supported with plentiful amount of research. I highly recommend this book to everyone. We are in an era where people are classified as either successful or unsuccessful and the successful ones are seen as the &amp;ldquo;special ones.&amp;rdquo; In reality, though, everyone has a shot at becoming victorious.",4
"The multiple ingredients to achieving success. This great read makes one point clear - there are several ingredients that will need to come together to drive success. While not a “self help” book, this for me opened my mind to opportunities that - with my special set of “ingredients” - I am in the right place and time to pursue. There are a massive number of takeaways we should consider as a society in USA, particularly in my opinion in suggestions (studies) done on primary education styles.",5
"like antibiotics that heal the wounds caused by motivational posters. The most amazing thing about this book is the near-total lack of pat answers, cliched figures, cheap opinions, and the like. It's as if the writer was truly interested in presenting an unbiased and factual look at a meta-understanding of sorts concerning his subject.",4
"Not scientific yet thought provoking. Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good ""airplane books"", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day. Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.",4
"Five Stars. Great perspective on success. No fables, no myths.",5
"Interesting Book. Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell gives the stories of men and women who",5
"One of the best!. This is book reads/narrates like a series of short stories that illustrate a larger concept, that hard work and opportunity rather than ambition alone make for success. Outliers is my favorite business/success book yet. Love it and highly recommend for anyone, entrepreneur or otherwise.",5
EASY READ. EXCELLENT BOOK VERY EASY TO READ WITHOUT A LOT OF EXCESS VERBIAGE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK WILL READ MORE OF BOOKS BY MALCOLM GLADWELL,5
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Read with an open mind this book is definitely a life changer. One of the most inspirational and motivational book to date.",5
Excellent book with thought provoking presentations that will last a lifetime.. Excellent and thought provoking review. A must read for everybody.,5
Five Stars. Great,5
... for me simple and very practical truths that are easy or perhaps convenient to ignore - peoples' backgrounds that .... The book brought out for me simple and very practical truths that are easy or perhaps convenient to ignore - peoples' backgrounds that truly and more accurately complete their stories of success. Thank you Malcolm!,5
Five Stars. I really enjoy reading another Gladwell's book.,5
"Brilliant.. I think that Outliers should be required reading in high school. It's not just insightful, it actually helps you understand how to succeed, and overcome obstacles you didn't even know you faced. Brilliant.",5
"Beautifully Written. Makes one think about life differently and in effect, challenges the long held narrative that doing well i.e. winning in life is just a product of an individual's hard work . Outliers reminds us that culture, lineage, timing, and luck all factor into whether success is an outcome.",5
"The Unsolved Puzzle in Chapter Three - David Lai. I have no idea whether someone did such kind of review or not, but I am going to write an solution of a puzzle. This is for those who enjoy puzzles and seek an solution in reviews. In chapter 3, The Trouble With Geniuses, Part 1, at third part, about 23% of the entire book, second picture is a puzzle that tests one's intelligent level, and the author failed to provide the method to the answer. Start from the top left corner of the puzzle and notice the heart shapes, they all exist in three vertical lines. Then, to its right and to its down, notice the diamond shapes in those two pictures, they too are placed in all three vertical lines, and the rest merely has two. Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C. Finally, the hearts and diamonds only occur in two vertical lines not three, therefore, the option A fits the requirements and is the answer.",5
"Phenomenal read. I had to get this book for a class, but overall a phenomenal read, I recommend to anyone and everyone.",5
"Making the most of your opportunities. This was a great listen, the stories get more and more engaging and draw you in. There were a lot of great tidbits that I’ve talked about since reading making it a book that is easy to recommend.",5
"Great for parents. Malcom really made me change the way I think about how success is achieved, especially as it pertains to my own children.",5
Five Stars. Brilliant read,5
"Great insights, easy read. It's difficult to go wrong with Malcolm Gladwell.",5
Okay for a Used Book. It looks okay for a used book. There is no writing and highlighting. There is a small bend in the binding but it is a great used book.,3
Interesting. Great stories reflecting our human psychology/how we behave/interact.,5
"This book is a very important look at how our great innovators rise to success.. I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book. Finally, someone has come to the truth of the luck of birth at a certain time, and luck of opportunity combined with concentration by the innovator, in seizing thr oppotunity or window of time.",5
"Fascinating! Will change your perspective.. Some of the research is mind blowing, some of the research seems to come to a logical conclusion, A very small portion of it I just don't buy into. Still highly recommend this book to entrepreneurs, athletes, lawyers scientists, engineers and anyone trying to be the best at something, Or help someone else become the best at something.",4
"A book that makes you rethink how your past and culture may affect you and how to act upon it. I liked about the book that it makes clear that great success stories involve a lot of factors and people, that one may overcome (or be blocked) their cultural and family barriers. A book for a self-improvement process that not everyone is ever ready to start.",4
"Thought provoking.. I really enjoyed this book however I don't think it goes far enough. Why aren't all the hockey players born in Jan,Feb,March?",5
"Interesting pop science book - not scientfic, but is interesting. I thought this was a fascinating look into stories of success. What's key to notice is that although Malcolm Gladwell claims, or at least suggests, that he's looking at things scientifically, what he's really doing is telling stories. For instance, he doesn't really pin down what he means by success in the book, which makes the whole thing a bit tricky.",4
"Outliers. This was a fascinating read. Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me. The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward. Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.",5
Three Stars. Not quite what I expected but an interesting read none the less.,3
"Fantastic book. I really enjoyed this book. Some of the people here point out that there is no practical advice, so the first 2 times that I checked out the book on here I didn't end up getting it. But I had multiple people tell me to check it out so I finally got it.",5
"Great read, made me think and take a look .... Great read, made me think and take a look at things from a different perspective. I look forward to reading his other books. Genius is also a product of the times and opportunity.",5
factual. Interesting data and in depth research provides insights that are logical and factually supported. Well organized and a fun read.,4
Great read. A great thought provoking book that makes you question and consider how you made it in life...And take a more systemic point of view of life,5
So much great insight. Everyone should read this book including teenagers and young adults. Great perspective and much food for thought. I'll be re-reading certain chapters. Highly recommended.,5
"Great book. I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It has so many questions to make you think about in this life. And guess what, the answers are in there, and I guarantee you that all the theories sound very reasonable. They might not be 100% correct, but his theories cannot be neglected.",5
"Many undercurrents influence & direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro & micro levels.... This book was required reading for my high schooler this past Summer Break (but I got to it first). Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here. The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting. Convincing, great food for thought. The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time. I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages. (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.) For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research. This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education. The insights this book will provide them should serve them for a lifetime. The insights I gained, some of which were hypotheses previously, will serve to provide more understanding of what possibly may be going on under and around me during my lifetime.",5
"Best spur buy I've done. I was bored in a 4 hour Saturday morning class about technology management. I've heard about this book and was curious about it on why I was so popular. I found out after a few pages in. Mr. Gladwell grabs you instantly and never lets go until the last page. There's so much knowledge, one you've finished, it changes perspectives and opinions. It was a great ride and I'm looking forward to many more from Mr. Gladwell.",4
Great book. I love this book! I like the way how Malcolm Gladwell think about the world. He help us to see things from a diferent perspective.,5
"One of its kind. The book was recommended to me by a good colleague since she saw my aptitude for early childhood experiences that in my opinion not only shape our ego but also our vision and purpose in life. For me it was clear that next to the intelligence given to us these experiences matter most. Being born and raised between two cultures I could also conclude the importance of culture, beliefs and tradition to the education and early childhood experiences. Which I totally left out in my view of success was pure opportunity and LUCK. That is so beautiful that it hurts that Bill Gates and Stave Jobs - great minds and leaders without a doubt - are creations of 'being at the right time at the right place.",5
t. hhhhhhhhhhhhhh h h h h s s a a s s s. s s s s hoy uh.,5
"Thought Provoking. Love all the incredible stories and details!!! Such a talented human! Awesome, must read book!!",5
"Interesting and thought provoking. This book was recommended to me by Amazon (thanks, BTW), and I found it an interesting and insightful read. Gladwell has clearly done his research, and follows it up with a fluid and thought provoking journey through a number of 'events' and biography's that demonstrate how the sum of the parts in a given situation or success story play a more important role than an individual incident or skill alone. Worth a read.",4
Book. Good book,5
"Amateur.. Gladwell uses common knowledge to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He's the Disney knockoff of academia, the DC movies to the Marvel",1
"Gladwell's Usual Thoroughness. I am always impressed by the thoroughness of Malcolm Gladwell's research and ability to convey that into enjoyable, and insightful reading. This book attempts to convey the story behind the genius that often highlights successful people by breaking the reasons for their success down.",5
Buy it. Great book!! Packed with awesome knowledge,5
just wonderful. Gladwell simply makes one look at things through a clearer lens ... just listen to it already,5
Five Stars. I really enjoy reading another Gladwell's book.,5
I ran through several of his books quickly and enjoyed. Malcolms writing style and subject is quite addicting. I ran through several of his books quickly and enjoyed,5
Great Read. Very interesting analysis of successful people and how they came to be. Fun to read and with very insightful conclusions,5
smart. i loved the very insightful stories. it was obvious that this was researched thoroughly. one of the best,4
Product delivered quickly. Excellent condition,5
"I HAVE PROBLEMS NOT FULLY ANSWERED. The description, one chapter after the other, to describe an Outlier as one beyond the ordinary. In fact the stories are about ordinary people who took advantage of circumstances beyond their control. This is something ANYONE can do BY using whatever talents given to us. The point is learn your role and play it to the fullest. Each of us does not need to be an Einstein or a Beethoven 4 stars .",4
Book pages missing. Book is very good written and inspiring. But page no 102 to 118 is missing.,3
"Worth the read. I liked this book, it has good insight and is thought provoking.",5
"Five Stars. A good read, that makes sense. The harder you work, the luckier you become",5
Great for Managers. I’m a call center manager for a large tech company and I just loved this book. It gave me some great new insights on how the little things can turn into big advantages.,5
Fantastic and Humbling. A lesson through the stories of other success. I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks to be successful in anything. I love that it was read by the author. I believe this give you the best experience when listening.,5
Five Stars. Great Author!,5
"Mindblowing!! Great work. Outliers, published in 2008 is a research the writer has done on success of various people. He tries to find various answers like why people are there where they are now? Why someone is successful or not? etc. In Outliers he examines various general phenomena like high achievements, hard work and individual talent using his short, illustrative and self-engaging proofs and his quality to show complex things with simplicity. According to him hard work is always the main thing behind every succe...",4
Excellent book...the author did a lot of research. Great book. We listened to it on Audio. This was a purchase for our son.,5
Five Stars. Real good read.,5
Excellent mind expander!. This book explains WHAT you don’t take into consideration when it comes to success. Forces you to consider or create the environment to make things happen.,5
Packed Full of Great Information. This is a really interesting book! Full of valuable information! I read this for my book club and would highly recommend for others to do the same. After reading this you want a forum through which to discuss all the data that was shared.,5
"Can Outliers become the new Normal? YES! If we know how to design the right environment to learn, grow, and contribute.. Are outliers normal, only for the very small fortunate few, or can we create outliers as a normal? Mr. Malcolm Gladwell does a fantastic JOB discussing how our environment creates outliers.",5
Re-frames Success. I have enjoyed every book Malcolm Gladwell has written - his style weaves real-life examples together to support some big ideas and the examples in Outliers are rather compelling. From Hockey Leagues to healthy towns - the concept of Outliers is illustrated perfectly.,5
"Reading group. A must read, and share. What an eye opening book. I could see all my children in it, and I have changed some of my parenting because of it",5
"Stained book. My book came stained, sticky, dirty and feels used.",1
Five Stars. Good,5
"Fascinating.. Gladwell's books are absolutely fascinating. The topics he explores often seem completely mundane, however, the angle he takes on all of these subjects are completely unusual. The end result is a greater understanding of the subject matter and more importantly, a greater understanding of the processes being described in the books.",5
Just wow!. stupendous,5
Best audiobook so far!. I think audiobooks are best when it's presented by the author. Malcolm Gladwell's intonation makes the experience with Outliers better than when I read the hardcover. Loved it!,5
"fantastic, insightful, and reflective. A very good listen, makes you eventuate all the events in your life and that of your parents and family as well.",5
Really Nice. Awesome book,4
Outliers is outstanding. What made Bill Gates a computer whiz at a time when very few people knew about computers? How did Wayne Gretzky become such an outstanding hockey player? What are the circumstance that make an individual just good and another great? The answers may surprise you.,5
Can't review. Amazon is making me review this book before I've even read it! This kindle feature is fascist. Blah blah blah,1
"Epic. Excellent book. Particularly recommended for teenagers (and their parents) who wonder why they might be under-performing or what they will end up doing with their life. It is full of 'A ha"" moments When I first started reading it I wasn't enthralled but as the author started to show connections and underlying situations that build up to success, I was really impressed.",5
"A fun read until about half way. I really enjoyed parts of the book. However, there were. Few chapters that completely lost my attention. Almost overly focused in that the underlying point was unclear until clarified later.",3
Very insightful from start to finish.. Never has a book ever become so alive . We can all achieve more if we put in a little bit of effort .,5
"Statistics can be made to prove anything. Although some of the ideas in this book are interesting to consider, my general feeling was that the author bent the information to fit his personal viewpoint. t did not come as a surprise to learn that being in the right place at the right time is a great advantage in life.",3
Very interesting read. Just as entertaining as the others .... Very interesting read. Just as entertaining as the others.,5
"Everything happens for reason.. I have long thought that there are no accidents in life. Even the smallest occurrences can have far reaching consequences. Mr. Gladwell has explained that so well in this book. I was amazed at so many of the things that seem like just a coincidence, are very important to a person's future.",5
Excellent reference on opportunities of outliers.. Malcolm does a great job using different successes to describe outliers. It gave me a new perspective on what makes a person or a group of people standout. It is a great book and I would recommend it.,5
Great book. Interesting book. Well written. Good ideas.,5
"Malcolm Gladwell's new book reads like a series of cocktail-party anecdotes. Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:",3
Great book. The book has a lot of very inspiring stories on 'outliers'. You can view those successful people from very different angles. I agreed with the author that we often ignored some tiny but important steps of their success.,5
Wow! Success is much more than luck or genetics. This is a great book to listen to. I'm glad my children are still at an age where I can apply this info.,5
Mind blowing!. So far this book is blowing my mind and I'm more than excited to finish it!,5
"Insightful. This book will change your perspective on success. Whatever your definition of success is, it will encourage you to examine and position yourself for success.",4
"Very interesting, marginally useful... still a 5.. This book is very interesting with good stories throughout. It is marginally useful as to practical information for most people. I still would recommend it and have rated it as a 5. I am going to listen to it more than once.",5
Very interesting book. Very interesting book. A good read!,4
"Great for inspiration and stories but lacks practical steps forward.. Excellent, very insightful. I love the stories and the examples he gives. A lot of general, and inspirational knowledge to be found here and it's written well.",4
not cohesive. the story is somewhat scattered ... I would stop reading for a day and come back to it thinking i was reading another book.,3
"Transformational. Cutting edge. A must read. That said, this book has been so quoted in the last few years, that it seems positively mainstream. Nevertheless, seminal books have genius in them, and I think that this is one of those.",5
Just okay. Book is very helpful for entrepreneurs. But the paper quality and printing is too bad. I'm not satisfied with book quality. Please improve it.,3
Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement. This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,5
"Excellent Book!. It changes the way you look at the World and society. Parts of the book was an OMG, I always knew that!",5
"Outliers. I am enjoying reading this required book for class, learning new ways to improve learning strategies, and interesting stories .",5
Five Stars. If you like detail,5
"Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books. This book was a phenomenal read - highly enjoyable, and it really made me think. Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books.",5
"Excellent book!!!!!!!. This was a very enjoyable listen. Extremely informative -- as a Canadian, I now plan on having my kids in the first few months of the year (you'll understand once you've read the book). Empowers you to feel that you too can be great. Gladwell himself narrates the book and his voice is clear and soothing. A definite recommendation to friends.",4
Great book!. Made me take on a different perspective about success. He made it very relatable. Made me self examine and adjust some things with myself. Loved it!,5
Love this book - just read for second time. So many useful ideas in this book and love the data that sits behind everything. Well written,5
Excellent Must Read. This has got to be one of the top five books I’ve ever read! Very poignant and important. This should be a mandatory read for everyone.,5
Best book I've ever listened to.. I wish I would've read this book 15 years ago. Gave me a new motivation to raise my kids differently than I was raised.  Couldn't stop listening. Finished it in one day.,5
"Highly remmended read. This is a read for every person who may wonder why some people lead ""charmed""lives and most of us don't. It explains in well written and easy to read detail that is the hard work, opportunities seized, and belief in the unknown future that makes greatness, if not in ourselves, then in our children. A must read for all those who don't understand the wisdom of hard work being it's own reward, not handing things to people and expecting the same appreciation.",5
Still recommending this one!. Long after I read this I've been mulling over the ramifications of what shapes our success (and failures). Probably edges out 'Blink' and just a little more interesting for my line of work than 'What the Dog Saw'. Both of those books still worthy of the highest rating.,5
A good read. A good read,4
"New Perspective. This is a totally unusual, yet practical view at some of the aspects that lead to success. I had never thought of outliers from the perspective of the author. Very good read and I got my entire family hooked on it.",5
"Fantastic. From beginning to end, so educational. They say this man writes this book is an art in itself. I've learned so much.",5
"Fascinating. I loved this book. At first there appear to be lots of statistics and facts but this quickly emerges as an overall theme which underpins the development of understanding generally, the ingredients which can lead to success.",5
"Four Stars. Great book, super easy read. Very interesting concepts, especially for someone who hasn't read his previous work",4
"Another great Gladwell book.. Strongly recommended. Easy read but inspiring. As usual, Gladwell opens your eyes to illustrate what you've always looked at but never really saw",5
Loved it! Highly recommended!. Loved it so much I sent it to a friend. The interview at the end was great!,5
"Five Stars. great book, good read.",5
"understanding Success. this book will give you a true understanding, how successful people become truly successful. A better insight on what it means and what it takes for the road to success.",5
"Letter to the Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your terrific book ""Outliers"" I wanted to talk about some of the topics discussed in the book. Overall, the book had some very strong connections showing how time and place affect a person's success. (This therefore makes them outliers) How time and place affect a person is my English IV class' essential question. The essential question's purpose is to offer connections between many different texts and show how they can all relate to one another. Many topics you have made in your book, such as Jewish lawyers, geniuses and plane crashes all relate back to our essential question. he Three Lessons of Joe Flom was a very informative chapter. I found it to be a good example of karma because the Jews were given negligible law cases in the 1950's, but when those cases turned out to be valuable, the Jews were experts at them. Time is a defining element of success throughout your book. For example, I agree with your insight about Mort Janklow and how he was given the opportunity to succeed because of when he was born. (In comparison with his Father) A question comes to mind after reading this chapter. Are there any advantages to being born in 1992? This is when I was born and I wonder if there are any built in advantages here. he Trouble with Geniuses Part II is equally an interesting chapter. I have always wondered how much IQ has to do with how smart a person really is. You have cleared up the question and I have learned more about IQ then I have ever known before. I agree with your comparison of Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer. Langan lacks social skills and practical sense, while still being a genius. Oppenheimer had the social skills and was a genius, which allowed him to be innovative and extremely successful in his career. I question why Chris Langan was not as successful. Many people have weak social skills and a much lower IQ and are still successful. With his IQ, I would imagine he could easily overcome his inadequacies. he Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes was probably the most interesting chapter I read in your book. It was stunning to see that there is actually a difference between cultures that could actually lead up to something catastrophic, such as a plane crash. After reading about index power ratings and other information, I totally understand how differences in place could affect how one interprets their language. Do you think there is any where else we could apply this index rating? If so I would love to hear about it because I think it could really help understand the differences that time and place have on society. his book has helped me think about why I am who I am. There is so much more to think about that you have helped me to unlock. Maybe I could be better at math if I was Asian. Maybe I have a culture of honor engraved in me and I just don't know it. Many of your topics relate to my life and I question really why things happen. I now know what it means to be an outlier and how the outliers truely got to where they are. incerely, ohn S.",5
"success. The author's views are very interesting. Age as a factor in sports or school has always been known to teachers. My area allows school entrance with birthdays up to about through October. So children born in November, December and January have an age advantage in sports and studies.",4
"What month were you born ? -a surprising analysis of high achievers. Malcolm Gladwell has taken a remarkably broad approach to try to identify if there any factors in common between 'OUTLIERS' - people whose achievements lie well beyond the normal range. His studies are as diverse as Mozart, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. He looks at football teams and ""geniuses"". His conclusions are unexpected but compelling - lateral thinking which surprises and entertains. I couldn't stop quoting bits and recommending this book to all my friends - it may not change your life but it will give you a new insight into some possible precursors for outstanding achievement. It's an easy read - I really couldn't put it down!",5
"an educator's look at success factors. This was an amazing research project as to what makes some people successful, however, the section on Korean pilots was too long and not relevant to me as an educator. The most relevant to me was looking at kids' birthdates and how it forced them into academic or athletic experiences they weren't mature enough to handle.",4
Five Stars. Everyone should read this book. I've 5 copies for friends and family.,5
"When opportunity meets hard work. Glad well does a good job of dispelling the myth of a lone success. He more accurately depicts the opportunities that were unique in time and the individuals who recognized and took advantage of what was made available. That is to say, they worked like crazy. A good read that I found very encouraging.",4
"Excellent book. I’m not sure what I was expecting to hear when I purchased this book but I am so pleasantly surprised and thrilled with this purchase. The book was so well written, detailed, informative and was had well supported theories. This book has truly changed my life in that it has given me a new way of thinking about success, life, child rearing, family, community, my personal impact on others and the responsibility I have to do and be my very best for the human community at large. This was extraordinary. Very well done!!!",5
Nice read. Good book for the $,4
Good Read. New way to look at things,4
GREAT BOOK EVERYONE IN AMERICA SHOULD READ IT.. This is a great and enlightening book. It is truly thought provoking. I am recommending it to everyone I know.,5
"Don't think just read. This is the book you need to read and will fill in a lot of unanswered questions you didn't even know you had. It will unhinge your view on life, people, success, culture, and more... you won't be able to look at the world the same.",5
"Great book!. This was really fascinating and I found myself not only thinking about the ideas Mr. Gladwell brought up, but discussing them with others as well. I bought the audio book version to listen to on my drive to and from work and actually found myself looking forward to my commute each day! Great book!",5
"What I expected from Malcolm. I find something really appealing about Malcolm Gladwell’s voice and narration style. I first hear him through his podcast, and grabbed one of his books through an Audible trial. It’s everything I expect from Gladwell coming from his podcast: alternative viewpoints, an in-depth look at topics that seem to be a simple and straight-forward issue at first brush. And through the book, he ties those concepts in over and over.",5
Loved it!. Read this for a sociology section. Loved it!,5
Forward Thinking!!. Never dull moment in these books. Malcolm Gladwell has a great way of tying together a bunch of stories to make his point that sometimes being way out there is the way to go!,5
Ingredients for success. A powerful sociological writer who uses extensive research to come up with some challenging theories on human behaviour.,4
"Unimpressive. Unimpressive. Lots of flimsy data, incorrect assumptions and circular reasoning peddled as fact. Moreover, I don't think Gladwell actually says anything new in this undercooked rehashing of the nature versus nurture debate.",1
Exceptional reading. If you're a fan of Gladwell (and/or ice hockey) you will love this book. Fascinating stories of how some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs grew to become who they are today.,5
Outliers: The Story of Success. Product arrived promptly as described.,3
Inspiring and thought provoking. Highly recommend Outliers! Malcom Gladwell is a compelling narrator with a voice that is easy on the ears. I will be listening to this again.,5
"Evocative, intriguing, powerful. This is such an amazing book! Gladwell is a fantastic writer. This book really changed the way I feel about education and success. Highly recommend. It's one of the best modern books I've read in a very long time.",5
"Gives you a new perspective. Yes, the book gives you a new way to look at success; however, the most noteworyhy is the way he makes you revisit the way we (should) approach ""matters"", in general.",4
"I'm sure as hell damn good at what I do right now. I bought this book sometime in 2014 and since I just had to post a review for another book I just read, I've decided to share my thoughts on this book as well.",5
"I like this one also. I like this one also, and will read more of his books, thank you, sort of balances with Scott Adams, what one takes away the other gives back, in the currency of human rationality and idiocy...they are both fun!!!!!",5
"Outliers: The Freakonomics of Psychology. Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an ""outlier."" The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.",4
Life changing. Changes your perspective and thinking,5
"best book I've read all year. Wow ! this book helped me discover so many things about myself, family & friends. It is like having one more lens to view life with.",5
"It is easy to see why The Outliers. It is easy to see why The Outliers, The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell was the number one national best seller. This book includes remarkable stories that I found fascinating and inspiring. This book is about many different people and stories from different walks of life and how they were able to find success. Malcolm Gladwell explored how culture, family, opportunities, and time periods shaped some of the most successful people. This is a very enjoyable, easy to follow, and relatable book that I loved to read.",5
I strongly recommend the book. A most for everybody BUT specially for parents. The statitic studies are very convincing of how we can help our children develoment,4
So far excellent book. Easy to read but very intuitive into .... Haven’t finished it. So far excellent book. Easy to read but very intuitive into why some people become successes and others aren’t.,5
"Interesting. Even though the conclusions were the authors, I really enjoyed his explanations of how he reached them. I found them fascinating and logical.",5
An outstanding book with a talented author that translates scientific findings into wonderful stories for the average reader. A friend suggested this book and I am grateful to him for this recommendation. I enjoyed reading it and recommended the book to others including my family.,5
Everyone should read this book. Malcolm Gladwell is a master at dispelling the useless cultural narratives we create to explain success.,5
Great!. This book really has changed the way I thought of things. I received it right away and It was in great shape. I would recommend it to my friends!,5
"Outstanding!. Malcom Gladwell does another fine job of storytelling while informing the reader of things they likely hadn't considered. It drives a stake through the heart of the American fantasy of ""I made it all on my own"" - ""I'm a self-made person"".",4
Needs To Be On Every Student's Required Reading List. I don't care who you are; read this book.,5
Very interesting. I really love topics that explain possible reasons for behavioral/social outcomes. I've always been interested in psychology but sometimes it's interesting to hear about non-abnormal psych topics. This covers topics that can be considered abnormal but mostly abnormal in the good way - extraordinary people.,5
Four Stars. Interesting insgiht around success,4
"Awesome read for motivation. I must admit starting the book with references on sports were not very interesting since I am not a sports fan, however the whole point was to reference how people's circumstances translates into an opportunity. With each example he gave, he backed it up with reasonable background information.",5
Factors in success.. I loved this book. It is so fascinating; there are ideas about success that I had never considered. There are certain situations that need to be in place before success can happen. The most interesting aspect is the fact that success is not ONLY dependent on the person's ability and intellect. There are many other factors.Read the book and be intrigued!,5
Four Stars. Great book!,4
Opportunities and luck is more important than high Iq and intelligence. A true eye opener that makes us look at success differently. It makes us challenge success stories we hear and to dig deeper for the real cause of the success. Malcolm argues that it many times are a series of lucky events or opportunities rather than high Iq and intelligence that lies behind someone's success or superiority.,5
Five Stars. excellent,5
Great book. Great book couldn’t put it down,5
5 star. Read it before. Highly recommend it to anyone. Bought copies for several friends.,5
"Interesting philosophy. This book wasn't what I originally expected, however by the end it's definitely got my brain juices flowing and looking at the outliers around me. All around a good addition to my library.",5
Five Stars. Would highly recommend this book because it really gets you thinking about life and success,5
Interesting Read. It was an interesting read but not my favorite my author. Learned some interesting things so worth reading!,4
"An easy and good book to read. Short review but a lot of what is discussed is common sense and general knowledge but the author takes a interesting twist it on things by using real life examples and scenarios, that elevate your knowledge base of what makes some people successful and others not. More over, it is a very easy fluent book to read which also made it interesting.",4
Brilliant. This story really helped put all the factors that going into success in perspective! Great read and really empowering!,5
"Great read.. This is a story to read that will change your perception on things. I'm not saying it'll change your life or anything but it will change how you look at things. It'll make you question things more throughly. I enjoyed it very much. It contained a lot of factual information that with a grain of salt, made a social theory on how and why people are successful/the way they are. It shows that people are successful due to the help of other and their situations, not luck. It's a good read if you like theories!",5
"Great Wisdom. One of the most thought provoking books of our time. Important read for parents, leaders and educators. Success is connected with hard work. Loved the true examples and thought provoking life stories. True life is better than fiction! Must read!",5
"Fascinating interpretation of success. Gladwell has an inviting style of writing. It's as though he's chatting with the reader, alone, over coffee. His unpretentious,natural manner is the antithesis of his extraordinary observations and insights. A great read .",5
"No secret of success, but good ideas!. This is a very nice book to listen to, with many eye-openers that I feel like looking deeper into. Gladwell brushes the surface on many concepts, but connects them in a seemingly logical way.",4
Entertaining and well thought out. This book was great to listen to during my commute. Malcolm present plenty of ideas to make you think and spend time wondering who and what the current outliers are.,5
"Quick, Fun and Thought-Provoking Read. Gladwell does it again! I read Tipping Point a number of years ago and picked this one up recognizing the same author. It's one of those cool books that give you a thought buzz for days. His unique pretension of success-connectivity is fascinating. As always, Gladwell supports his theories with very clever statistics which sometime outshine his proposals.",5
"Eye Opening!. It is amazing that most of us think we know the story of success and it's components. In this book, Mr. Gladwell, looking from a different perspective, shines a whole new light on the process. From hockey to billionaires, His theory posits that it takes more than skill or a genius mind to find the pinnacle of success. Timing and opportunity seem to play a larger role than we may have suspected. As I listened though, the truth seems to be quite clear. It takes a lot of things to line up just right to make a world changing individual. This is a great wake up call for parents, teachers, coaches or anybody else that might be in a position to guide, train or support a young aspirant in any field or endeavor. Are we missing out of 50% of the worlds talent? Listen to this book and decide for yourself. It is time well spent.",5
Great book. This book was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone.,4
"Interesting but stupid. The research and data are interesting but his conclusions are dumb. He comes right out and says that he is trying to debunk the ""myth"" that hard work and good choices bring success and instead tries to reduce all human success to a sort of lottery game.",1
"Fascinating history. This book was one of those which pulls you toward the next chapter. It's one of those you just can't put away, and finishes too soon.",5
Five Stars. Gladwell. Period.,5
"All In Education Should Read This. This book should be an interesting read for anyone, but I particularly want to highlight the need for all educators to read it. Current educational policy needs a whack on the side of the head. (I write this as an experienced teacher neck deep in No Child Left Behind, and the policy makers' forcing ""research based strategies"" into our lesson plans.) Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily. But it does give the reader a chance to pull their head out of today's pervasive educational group think and consider alternatives.",4
Five Stars. Awesome book. Opens your mind to see the world as opportunity.,5
"Review of Outliers. Haven't quite finished it but find it stimulating, thoughtful, and challenging. Well worth the read. I have also recommended it to others.",5
"An interesting read.. Found it to be a very interesting read. Gladwell is an interesting guy himself. Really enjoyed it, and it's a quick read.",4
Four Stars. Great perspectives. Need to process what I read and compare with related reading but definitely worth the purchase.,4
"Read like a bad doctoral dissertation. I have to preface this by saying I am a psychologist, and have taught psychology. This author's understanding of the value of both the Terman study and psychological testing is so poor, that it is clear that he only used this information to make his point. He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential. He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking. He needed to understand far more about what he was writing. I read this for a book club, and if this is their idea of important reading, then I'm going back to Danielle Steel, at least its escapist for an afternoon.",2
"Stories of success and perhaps failure as well. I could'nt put down. It is full of insights that I had nerver considered. It emphasized that no one is a self made genius but rather the product of attachments to others that nurture along the way. Also great insights regarding prejudice and how it is learned inter-generationally as he writes about families like the Hatfields vs McCoys. We are all products of our environment with all of its nuancies/expectations that we are left to examine in our life times. A life not examined can feel lonely, dead, and leave your soul barren.",5
"Practical knowledge, easy to read, good presentation.. Easy read, excellent presentation.",4
"Learn what makes success-Really. Wonderful book full of clear view on who succeeds and why that happens. Clear indications for education, parenting, and personal choices. I highly recommend this book!",5
"Fascinating. Thought provoking and fascinating. A different look, a different approach to analyzing success. Thoroughly enjoyed it and want to read more of his books.",5
"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",5
"re-evaluative read. gladwell's ""the outliers"" is an insightful and thought-provoking book. it also makes you think twice about the factors of success.",4
"Success is less about personal ability than it is about opportunity and hard work.. I chose this rating because this book gave me a lot of food for thought.The information was fascinating and the writing style brisk, amusing and easy to read. Success doesn't occur in a vacuum, it is more like a puzzle of many parts. I recommend this book for anyone who has ever wondered how the famous, and the successfully where they are and why.",5
"Great book, but.... Voice is very easy to listen to. but last 10 min of ch 3 and first 30sec of ch 4 is missing.",5
awesome read. This book was great! Extensive research obviously went into this. But the the best thing about is the story. Malcolm Gladwell is an awesome story teller!,5
Five Stars. Great thank you wonderful seller,5
"Amazing Book that Has Really Opened my Eyes Regarding How I View the Successful. My business mentor, Caterina Rando, has often referenced this book when speaking about the benefits of 10,000 hours towards mastery. I finally got around to listening to it and was blown away by everything I learned.",5
Five Stars. This is one of the best books I've read in my life.,5

"Must read!. Amazing book. LOVE. Top 5 favorite. Very fast read, lots of info, very informative!",5
quality. Good stuff,3
Outliers was a very interesting book. It really makes you think. Outliers was a very interesting book. It really makes you think about our society and the success of people- that was my favorite part. This book really opened my mind it made me realize how our society works. While reading some parts of the book I came to realization that our world really works the way it is described in Outliers. This book reveals a persons success within luck-one is lucky by birth but still work hard to become successful later in life.,4
"Interesting. Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful. Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc. I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read. I'd recommend it.",4
"Could change the world, if we want it.. Gladwell's methodical takedown of the Western myth of individual exceptionalism and success as a singular achievement is nothing short of masterful.",5
Five Stars. Excellent product and service,5
Five Stars. Love it.,5
Brilliant!. Absolutely Enjoyed it! Intelligent,5
"you may be able to better control and change them to foster success. Definitely changes your perspective on success by demystifying outliers and explaining the conditions and opportunities that lead them to where they are now. If you can identify these conditions in your life, you may be able to better control and change them to foster success.",5
Great read. I am reading this book again because I want to be sure to get all I can from it. Malcolm Gladwell has such a different perspective that one can't help but feel like you've been taught by a very wise instructor. I love all his books.,5
Boring. Very boring,1
"An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and .... An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and circumstances that have shaped our world, our nation and our fortunes. Well worth reading.",5
Different perspective. This is a very interesting book that presents a different perspective on success. It looks at how a person's birthdate has an impact on their success. He presents sports examples as well as business examples. Also explorers cultural impact on success.,4
"Great Book. What I took from this book is that success is largely based on practice and luck. It does a good job at showing how one seemingly minor decision can be the start to a career of success, without you ever knowing it then. It was a good book that seems often criticized by people claiming he twists his data to prove his theories, but a lot of what he says seems like common sense. For example the 10,000 hour rule. If you take it literally, you might think that 10,000 hours of practice magically results in success. That's an absurd criticism I've seen too much of. Take him seriously, and you'll understand that Gladwell isn't saying that at all.",4
This book will completely change the way comprehend success. I can’t take off my outliers goggles of scrutiny,5
"Five Stars. Malcom Gladwell is a fantastic writer who makes a variety of concepts accessible for an audience with it without a scientific background. Outliers is an inspiring book, that is both fanatic to read, and have read to you. I am particularly fond of Malcom Gladwell's audio books as he reads them himself, instead of a different narrator.",5
Read the first few chapters. The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell,3
"Just OK. The thesis is redundantly applied to every occurrence as a universal law of the universe. I rather think Gladwell fit selected historical events to the theorem....thus a tight fit. In general I thought it interesting but a ""so so"" audio book. It would not be a waste of your time to listen to the Outliers.",3
A must read book !. A must read !,5
Four Stars. Revealing and thought provoking look at yet another set of patterns that Gladwell has uncovered.,4
I love it. Interesting & excellent book.,5
"must read. A very thought provoking book that helps one to think outside the box. I like the ""intelligent enough"" look on education at major colleges, although we probably won't change how things are done but maybe we should.",5
Excellent!. If you want to be successful or have a successful kid...read this book. It changed my prespective.,5
"As a small business owner I had hoped to get .... As a small business owner I had hoped to get something out of this book that I could use myself. Since the bulk of the stories are about 19th century immigrants to NYC, I didn't get too much. I didn't take the stories as much more than an indication to look around and see what could be done to improve myself with the ideas and skills that I already have. Already doing that.",3
Great. Great page turner which is well written. Arrived fairly quick.,5
Five Stars. Great read!,5
World Changing... Re-reading Now. This book includes knowledge that could change the world if applied to real world cultural issues. This book reads as highly engaging and I couldn't put it down. It has now been added in my annual must read list. Wow!,5
"Excellent!. Gladwell is a fine writer and this book, in the same style as Blink, explores the real factors that contribute to the success of those we think are so above and beyond us (Bill Gates, the Beatles, etc.). Gladwell makes it clear that their talent, drive, energy, and intelligence WERE key to their success but that these, alone, would not have done it for them. They needed unusual opportunities. In fact, the opportunities given them that were not given others were as important to their achievements as their personal qualities. This book helps reduce the ""superstars"" down to human level. If you had been given the opportunities these were, you might have achieved what they did or more!",5
Three Stars. 1000 HOURS.... IT IS TRUE,3
Great book for everybody!. Great book with valuable insides into the different ways to be successful in any field.,5
"Some more interesting than others. While some of the stories and examples in this collection are, by far, more interesting than others, overall this was a really insightful read - quick, too!",4
"Amazing book. Life is about learning different point of view, and this author is great at making you think!",5
excellent read very thought provoking. Gladwell outliers is a page turner. He has a knack for telling great stories. One of his many books that I would recommend.,4
"Starts Strong. The books starts great very intersting, but as you go through the book you start missing interest. It could have been a great book if it where shorter",4
Absolutely out of this world!. They say traveling broadens the mind. Well boy did this book take me on a journey. I provided me with a context to events that one always thought of as extraordinary and left me thinking about the world like I never could have imagined. As a result of this book I look a world differently; I consider success differently; I truly feel as if I can speak from a more wise point of view about the world and it's events around us.,5
Amazing read would recommend to anyone. Great read. Turns the conventional wisdom upside down not just in theory but also great anecdotes..Malcolm has raised bar for himself yet again,4
"Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the .... Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the success of somewhat talented, but ordinary people who were given an opportunity to excel at just the right age and at just the right time and those factors were key in creating extraordinary talent and success. This book gives surprising reasons for why intelligence, talent and or money aren't the only factors for the success of certain individuals.",5
"Bought it twice because I liked it so much.. This is a replacement book, I loan my other to a friend and never got it back. I found this book fascinating and very interesting. It made a lot of sense.",5
Five Stars. EXCELLENT BOOK!,5
"Inspiring. Good book, another perspective. Easy to read. I agree with most of his ideas, however some of them are not convincing at all.",5
"Why is this a best seller?. I don't see how Gladwell has told us anything new. It's a collection of stories of how individuals with successful lives made it because of their connections, upbringing, financial status or the like. Each story paints the same picture which could be summed up in a short paragraph: success is arbitrary and just because you work hard doesn't mean you'll have it happen to you.",2
"Great read that reviews a lot of Outliers and how they became such.. This was a fantastic read. It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing. Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing. Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.",4
"Encouraged Desire. This book provided me great encouragement, education and inspiration. There were many times throughout Gladwell’s chapters that I found myself astonished by his articulated outcomes and looking into my own personal life to answer the aging questions of “why.” As the story goes on, I found myself looking and thinking about the success stories in different ways and how I could personally learn from them to further my own personal growth and development. Overall, a fantastic book that I would encourage to all!",5
Very thought provoking.. Will written and brought in lots of new ideas. Really had a good time questioning current views on success.,5
"convincing story of success. The author definitely has gotten his ten thousand hours of practice in the nurturing environment. The book is written clearly and convincingly. If this is not enough, there are many good videos on youtube, where he further elaborates his point. Do possess necessary prerequisites (iq sufficient for university or height for basketball), work hard in supportive environment, have your feet firmly on the ground, and the success is likely to come. Of course, there may be systemic (chronological, cultural, etc.) obstacles. Blame these if success didn't happen or be grateful if you were lucky",4
"Gladwell is a genius. Malcolm Gladwell is uniquely gifted in being able to first identify common assumptions and beliefs of social importance that are in fact questionable, then to make inspired connections that build a case for a contrarian perspective, and finally to present the evidence in a totally compelling, non-patronising and inspirational way. I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance. We should treasure visonaries and communicators like Malcolm Gladwell.",5
"YY. Outliers is amazing! Not to spoil it for everybody, but My favorite parts of outliers is the mathew effect ,10000 hours , joe flom, and many others. The chapter about why chinese are so good at math really amazed me. Im a asian too but i never knew that was why chinese were so smart . So i wont spoil everything im going stop here",5
"Awesome read for motivation. I must admit starting the book with references on sports were not very interesting since I am not a sports fan, however the whole point was to reference how people's circumstances translates into an opportunity. With each example he gave, he backed it up with reasonable background information.",5
"Fascinating. Mr. Gladwell did his research on this one. It was fascinating to read about all of the factors that contribute to a person's success. Talent and hard work are definitely important but there are so many more components to it. I really enjoyed reading about those components. It gave true meaning to the term ""perfect storm"".",5
Novel ideas!. I'm glad I finally got to read this book! Gladwell's ideas are very original and nicely articulated. The book is well structured and supplements each idea with examples and studies. Nice work!,5
Five Stars. makes you think a little differnt about most things around you,5
Five Stars. A fascinating study into success. Very enlightening,5
Remarkable. A wonderfully insight into the secrets that make a person successful. A little sad at some points due to unsuccessful or poor people with everything out of their own hands just waiting to get dealt the right cards.,5
Curiosity did not kill the cat.. this book was amazing!,5
Well written and thought provoking.. Interesting read. Some of the points made are common sense but this books makes a good analysis of what successful people have in common. Definitely worth the time.,4
"Quality Gladwell. If you are familiar with Malcome Gladwell's pod cast, Revisionist History, this is the long form. Outliers is engaging, fascinating, compelling and deeply thought provoking. I will be listening to it again to catch the points I may have missed and clarify my own thoughts about the ideas and dense research presented.",5
good insights about what looks like magical success. I believe in the idea of 10k hours rule and the hardwork that successful people have to do.,3
Highly recommend. Great read of fascinating stories and insight on the human race. Hard work doesn't guarantee success but so much more is required. Malcolm has done it again.,5
Very interesting. I thought the examples were very intriguing. I would like to see some examples of what to do if you are not in the fortunate categories. How can you still become successful.,4
"Excellent. This book really makes you think, it also drives home the point that with hard work and the right circumstances anyone can be exceptional. Success comes from your drive but also from those around you and how you were raised. It was a great listen!",5
"Exceptional, in depth read!. If you ever wonder how things work read any one of Malcolm's books, and you will be enlightened.",5
"must read. A fascinating and well reasoned analysis of the ""luck"" factors that contribute to success, and failure, in sports, business, flying, education etc. I highly recommend it.",5
"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",4
"Think differently about your own successes. Gladwell takes the reader into the depths of success and failure to understand what makes an Outlier. However, the end of the book highlights how small or major success in our lives today are the result of many circumstances. More importantly, the success you have today could be a huge impact for your family's future generations.",4
Excellent thought provoking book!. I got hooked on Malcolm Gladwell after seeing him on 60 minutes,5
"Excellent book on where success comes from!. This book is written in such a manner that makes it an unbelievably easy read. It lets the reader learn the concept of what makes successful people, well, successful. It goes step by step explaining the importance of circumstance and luck (yes, luck!) as key role players in the lives of people who achieve (or don't) the kind of success that we normally attribute to just hard work and ingenuity. It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part. This also helps the reader realize that to become successful there are barriers we have to overcome beyond our own personal shortcomings, that we have to work to overcome invisible barriers imposed on us by years and centuries of traditions and culture.",5
Love it. Excellent book. A great read!!,5
Five Stars. Great book! Very informative,5
Not as good as Tipping Point but still a great read.. No one gets there on their own. Great reality check about how hard work has to be coupled with some luck/circumstance to achieve great success.,4
Great book. very interesting and thought provoking book. a must read for anyone who wonders what really makes people successful. now read it!!,4
"Good. Good , but shipment time is too long, I was waiting long time, so I hope nest time can be quickly, the book looks like new one",4
"A new perspective. I have enjoyed diving into the different upbringings and cultural differences, it was helpful to identifying certain approaches I personally have done prior and currently. Helpful & insightful!",5
It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) .... Fascinating facts and examples capture the reader's attention but some of the author's opnions are not totally applaudable. It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) and right birthday... all these have to be right in order to be successful.,4
Fab Book!!. Excellent book...it gives different perspectives of success!! I loved it and will be purchasing other books by Mr. Gladwell,5
"Five Stars. Loved this book, easy to read and the logic follows throughout the book.",5

Five Stars. If you're reading this you are now a fool not to read this book.,5
Like research?. Like the science behind the information,5
"Secrets of Success. Although the author may have made some sweeping generalities in his pursuit of discovering the secrets of successful people, he writes in a most entertaining and persuasive style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",5
"Loved this book! Lots of great insights.. I really enjoyed this book. I used some of the discussion points for talks with my son. It;s really cool to understand the ""rest of the story"" for some of these remarkable tales.",5
"Understanding what makes success helps in creating it; must read.. Very well written, easy to read and follow analyses of factors that contribute to success (or failure when missed), applied to examples in sports, business (computer industry, lawyers), education and aviation. Divided up into two parts; whereas the second part tries to focus on cultural legacy in general as a giant 'sleeper' (unknown) factor, the first part describes and zooms in on seemingly random examples in order to introduce us to the factors that are not generally known or associated with the successes high-lighted/discussed.",5
One Star. Horrible.,1
"Enlightening!!!. We often get amazed about the successful histories, focusing on how a given person has reached the top.... But this is only a tiny part of the iceberg that is left disclosed.... A lot richer and breathtaking succession of events summed with hard labor that is underneath the surface has a crucial role that leads to the final outcome. A must read if you are a parent!!!",5
Great book. It was very fun to read. It kept me on my seat the whole time. Very interesting subjects brought up. It was truly inspiring.,5
"Highly recommended. Good book. Easy to read. Thought provoking. Makes one think about privilege and opportunity. Interesting cases and anecdotes. I'll never look at self-proclaimed ""self-made"" people the same way.",5
Five Stars. Just as described!,5
Good Read!. Great book! I read it and passed it to a friend!,5
"5 stars = good. On to the next book. I'd take the time to write a well thought out review, but that's what the stars are for. 5 stars = good. On to the next book.",5
"Enlarging Your Frame of Reference. If you like to read to broaden your horizons, to challenge your way of thinking, to stimulate new ideas, and if you do not like overly pretentious, academic books that are bogged down in techno-speak and footnotes, then you will love this book. No, the writer is not presenting original research but Malcolm Gladwell is a genious at taking the research of others and putting it together in new ways that are thought provoking and mind-changing. I read this book very quickly but the ideas presented here about success and how it is attained will stay with me for a long time. It has changed how I look at myself and others. It is a wonderful book for discussion and could not be more timely as a we start a new administration committed to change.",5
"Very interesting and thought provoking. It is interesting, well done and thought provoking, His research and the results are clearly explained.",4
"Outstanding - Wish I Read this Sooner!. Outstanding - I have been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell for a very long time and just got around to listening to Outliers. I reference his previous works frequently in class, with clients and with family. Outliers will become a required text in my future classes. Malcolm, once again you made me think. Thank you!",5
Paper back. Very interesting book !,5
Four Stars. It was a gift.,4
"Interesting for a quick read. My review must apparently have at least 15 unique words, oh look there we go.",5
Five Stars. great,5
Thank you. You have opened a curiosity in me. That's why I open books every time. Thank you.,5
Did not meet my expectations. I've expected more from the book based on what people say about it.,3
"Great, Amazing, Easy Read. Great, amazing, easy read. I often force myself to sit down and read but this book made me want to, I carried it everywhere just to squeeze in a few extra seconds of reading. I can honestly say this book has educated me more and given me unlikely perspectives. If you don't read this book it's your loss.",5
"Friendly style and simply brilliant, buying copies for friends!. What I really love about this book is the way Malcolm Gladwell 'speaks' to the reader. I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?! An excellent read - some really persuasive stuff - great topics and theories to spark debates amongst friends and colleagues!",5
Another great read by Malcolm Gladwell. great book about success and the elite and the way they achieve it!,4
"Are There True Outliers?. Who would have ever thought that the Beatles, star athletes, and Bill Gates would have something in common? Most would think all they have in common is what meets the eye: their wealth. No, it's the fact that they are all outliers. In the book Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, Gladwell challenges their ""success"" by asking why was it so easy for these individuals? Gladwell uses data and facts that the ""average Joe"" can understand. Gladwell shows that the road to success isn't just determination and talent; it's also opportunities and social class. Gladwell shows that some successful people aren't just outliers; they are given advantages by circumstance, social class, and culture that you and I may not have. ladwell has a smooth writing style that is easily read. If you wanted a fluid, quick, and interesting book, I would recommend Outliers. It was fun to read and made me question if I was given these rare circumstances, who the person I could be if I was given all of the opportunities the ""outliers"" received. Outliers in a motivational and uplifting book about ordinary people who, given extraordinary circumstances, made the best out of it. Any book that has a good message like that gets a ""thumbs up"" from me. Gladwell uses a lot of charts, tables and other eye catching graphic items in his book to keep the reader not only entertained, but also to demonstrate that he is not just making up his data about the outliers. I really enjoyed how different outliers were discussed in same chapter to show their similarities. Gladwell also does a good job researching his topics including quotes from outliers and subject experts on the given subjects and people. He keeps an upbeat tone throughout the book and always proves his point thoroughly. ut with by proving his point so thoroughly, sometimes I was bored with all of the facts. While the book wouldn't be the same without all the facts, sometimes the point was overstated and redundant. Some may like the thoughtful thoroughness of the writing but I believed him and was in awe of the facts in short order. I would have liked to see how an average person could actually become lucky, a true outlier; but this of course would contradict the book. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to see someone who truly ""earned their stripes."" utliers is a book for anyone who has ever wondered why some excel while others just fit into the norm. It is a captivating book for anyone who wants to read about an engaging topic that gets into the heads of the world's elite members. The book is a book of success, and good fortune, for those who receive it. Outliers reminds us all to be all that we can be because we have been given certain circumstances or, as Gladwell states from the Matthew Effect, ""opportunities that lead to further success"" If you like an upbeat informative read the keeps you yearning for more, I would hands down recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.",4
"Very good. I liked the narrators voice, it is the type of voice that keeps you interested. Also the book itself has a very entertaining story i really liked and it changed the way i see stuff in life.",5
"Good reading, well written, feels like a novel. It is a well written book, it feels like providing a frugal explanation why it is normal to be ordinary, that you should be blessed by a series of conjunctions and factors to be an outlier, which is fine in some sense, however the good flow of the text brings more joy to this book. So I Recommend it for both reasons!",5
"Another brilliantly thought provoking read by the masterful Malcolm Gladwell. Amazing! He shines a new light on the ideal of what it is to be successful. By doing so it inspires the reader to take this new perspective and apply it to their own life and opportunities. Malcolm Gladwell never disappoints me as an author, and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this book.",5
"Interesting read. This was a real page turner, couldn't put it down once I started. Gives me incentive to spend the time necessary to master a skill.",5
Revelatory. good story of success. Writer makes the obvious point that success has a bit of luck factor and is product of its times.,5
"Helps to understad ""Outliers"". it is a great book, and helps us to build our ability to think about ""Outliers"". Though I read Tipping points by Gladwell, I really think Outlier wins. Malcom had done phenomenal job explaining the events and comparisons. Must read.",5
"this book really spoke to me on a personal level!. I found, as a creative person who didn't realize I was creative until after years and years, that this book was very affirming. It also helped me better understand ""how the world works."" Highly recommended.",5
The Differentitating Factor. This book gives us a new angle to look at life. It talks that the people who made big in life for them hard-work was one part and the second reason they succeeded is that they got the opportunity. Without the opportunity they would have never made it big.,4
"Meritocracy: The Great American Myth?. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"" attempts to shatter the American Dream, portraying it as a convenient myth that anybody in America, through hard work and brains, can enjoy a successful career and perhaps a life well outside the normal bell-curve. It is opportunity of circumstance that first sets the stage so hard work can really pay off: Without it, your swimming upstream or in the wrong river altogether.",5
"Ignoring the ""outliers"". Malcolm Gladwell calculates and and analyzes statistics that create a norm for the very successful; the outliers in society. The problem is that many parents are so abuzz with these patterns that they are attempting to make successes out of their children. (Darn shame happiness doesn't get factored in) Gladwell does not present statistics or examples of outliers of his formulas, of which I'm certain there are many. So this is an interesting but simplistic presentation. It is enjoyable reading. But as you read, consider the outliers of his formulas!",3
"Thought Provoking. Terrific book--very thought provoking. Still believe the type of success outlined is a combination of a proclivity towards a particular talent AND hard work....but Gladwell illustrates his theme beautifully. Easy, informative and enjoyable read. Great motivator as well--especially for teens!",5
Great!!. I am a psychologist who specializes in personality. This book is excellent. The author does excellent research and presents issues in a very engaging manner. All around great read!!,5
the book is totally BORING. If you are looking for an interesting book then this is not for you. If you want facts and success stories then read up.,1
Amazing book. I really enjoyed this book. The stories are told in a way that engaged me and made me want to hear more. I have referenced some of the examples of outliers he discusses in regular conversation which is always followed up with “how do you know this”?,5
Very interesting!. Great read! The statistics are so interesting. I had no idea certain sports were so skewed in favour of those born at a certain time of year. The fact can be empowering or hindering of course based on where you or your child falls...,5
Exceptional. So good! Gives so much insight into things we usually pass quickly by. Loved it!,5
MG will challenge your long held assumptions!. Malcolm Gladwell has been my favorite author of all time... after the Tipping Point I was hooked! this was my second time reading through the book and its even better than I remembered!,5
"A fun easy read. Gladwell is an excellent writer who is able to combine facts and weave it into a story. I had read several of his books. However, this one was my personal favorite. The only real critical review of this book written by reviewers was that there are no women, I was not bothered by this as a female. It is not an overly intellectual read, more something to read quickly for fun.",4
"Interesting. The book provides a very interesting view with many different examples. Outliers doesn't spend too much time talking about one subject, so it keeps you interested and moves around to many different fields (from athletics to air pilots). Offers up interesting evidence to support it's premise. If you're familiar with Malcolm Gladwell's works, this is probably one of his most interesting.",4
Five Stars. A must read for everyone!,5
Four Stars. good book to read if you want to know about success,4
"Really enjoyed it but it kind of ended really suddenly and .... Really enjoyed it but it kind of ended really suddenly and then had a lot of notes, critical acclaim, and nonsense...apart from the book was wonderful and insightful",4
A unique explanation for why some do and some don't.. Gladwell finally explains what I had suspicioned without the tools to understand just why it is that there have been clumps of people that have been to successful within an era. A most fascinating read.,5
"Intriguing but disappointing. This is the third Gladwell book that I have read. I started with ""The Tipping Point"" which was stimulating and for me quite insightful. I followed that expectantly with ""blink"" - this never seemed to get anywhere and has left me with little recollection of what it was all about. So I had hopes for better things with ""Outliers"" - the subject matter sounded interesting ""Stories of Success"" (whilst choosing to overlook some less than glowing reviews here.",3
"fantastic book, well written. fantastic book, well written, unbiased, full of interesting facts and information. enjoyable read. not sure what i got out of it, but it was interesting read, nonetheless.",5
Very enjoyable and interesting. Extremely interesting story. Brilliantly told. Malcolm Gladwell has an incredible way of unraveling a question and taking you through deeper and deeper connections of meaning. He is also an excellent story teller and very enjoyable to listen to.,5
Thought-provoking. I am always appreciative of Malcom Gladwell’s ability to make one think deeper into a situation. Throughout our lives we have always taken others’ success as arbitrary events but Outliers presents a chain of events that are not a coincidence. I hope more people read this book and see what opportunity and hardwork can do.,5
Five Stars. Interesting read,5
Five Stars. great quality,5
nice read. Well crafted and an easy to understand way of explaining the success of outliers. A good light read for everyone,5
"One of the best books I’ve ever read. I love the research that was done in order to put this together. I’m a huge stat lover, as well as puzzles, and this is a fun book that puts the pieces of “why” together. Fascinating",5
Outiers. This was definitely one of the most original and revealing book I have ever read.,5
interesting read. Nice story line. inspiring. The author's tone might cause you to use extra effort in listening,4
Great book. This book changed the way I look at things. Gladwell breaks success down into a few components:,5
"Great book.. Received in perfect condition, new.",5
"Cannot Recommend Enough!. I don’t take the time to write many reviews, because it isn’t often that I think the book was worth me taking the time to do more than give a star rating. But, I do think that this is one of those books that EVERYONE needs to listen to.",5
Five Stars. Gladwell is really great.,5
"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",4
"Great book!. Love all the info in this book. Very interesting information, has definitely inspired me in many different ways. Thanks Malcolm! I appreciate yah!",5
Five Stars. Gladwell is a genius!,5
"He's the BEST!. I am going to read everything by this GENIUS. I like his voice, his timbre and speed as he reads. His stories are so fascinating to me. I love the psychology and the sociology of the human being! He makes it so easy to understand. He asks such great questions and answers. I also like when he asks questions that sometimes don't have answers. Then gives you information and lets you decide for yourself! I look forward to his next installment!",5
"Second Time I bought this book !!. This is the Second time I have bought this book. The first book was borrowed from me before I even finished it..... it made its way thru the family and now is being passed around to friends. ""Outliers"" is marvelous, and I can well understand why it has stayed on the best seller list for so long. This book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell, and now I look for everything he writes. I will start reading this again, from the beginning, and with any luck will be able to finish it before someone borrows this copy, too !!",5
Interesting!. I found this quite interesting -- it certainly makes one review where their start in life has led them.,5
Mind blowing. This book opened my eyes to a new world of perspectives that is really changing how I view my own triumphs and failures. I loved it!!!,5
Item as described. Flawless transaction. Thanks.. Item as described. Flawless transaction. Thanks.,5
"Unique and refreshing.. Malcolm argues that success is not achieved by extraordinary individuals that set out to achieve it out of pure desire. Instead, extremely successful stories are derived from a compound set of events that play out over a long period of time (sometimes it takes generations) and is maximized by the individuals to harvest the potential of what was put in front of them.",4
Interesting and thought provoking. Pulling together multiple strands of experience and narrative into a single whole is done well. I certainly hadn't quite realised the extent to which our dates of birth affect life chances of individuals.,4
Pretty good. Awesome book,4
globalized perspective. Great look on how historical circumstances create modern society and how those circumstances also create an outlier.,5
"A must read for every one on planet earth. This book is fascinating, entertaining, insightful and deeply meaningful. It has changed the way i look at my own individual life inspiring me to want to seek out and take advantage of opportunities to work hard and achieve success and it has changed the way I look at our collective success as society. The implications of this message would have profound consequences for the way we organize ourselves as humanity and I think the more people that know about these principles the more prosperous and successful a world we could all build.",5
"Book Review. This book came very fast and is exactly like the picture, it’s a really good book and looks beyond the idealistics of the world.",5
"Brilliantly written and gripping read. Fabulous, it is brilliantly written, gripping read with meaningful conclusions. Really thought provoking, from one of the finest non fiction writer if our time.",5
Five Stars. Excellent book,5
Thinking out of the box. Malcolm Gladwell is an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the world in a non-traditional way. He challenges your assumptions and gets you to think. I like that in a book. I end up penciling a lot of questions and comments in the book margins as I read Gladwell. We have been talking in our family about the ideas in this book for weeks. This book definitely sparks discussion.,4
"Five Stars. Excellent information, easy to read and extensive research to illustrate concept presented.",5
A must read for all generations and ethic groups. Loved it! Thought provoking. Make me want to rethink how I teach my kids. Our actions are important and everyone has the ability to be successful it's not just for those that have a high IQ.,5
"Great read. Took less than 10,000 hours.. This is the second book that I have read from the author, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also now know why I am mediocre at math. Read to find out.",5
Useful. I liked the format used in approaching the reason for writing the book.,5
Torn pages.. Purchased new book . Pages were torn. Book looks old and somewhat worn out.,1
"I can't take the full credit for my success.... The above statement is one of the life changing take-aways I have from the book. Gladwell, uses a perfectly selected group of examples to explain the unique, and yet similar circumstances that it took for the Outliers to succeed. However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.",5
Interesting read. Very interesting book. Enjoyed most of it. Especially about the sports. Other bits no so interesting to me but still readable.,4
great book interesting perspective. I like the other point of view how he look at things and so the different perspective how we analyze and see the world is very unique and different basically break it down everybody can be successful if they had the right situation in their life are born at the right time so the circumstance basically relate to your own come or how your life might turned out or how your life will be and is a very interesting perspective I like the other point of view so that's my thought in the whole book,5
great buy. Great read. Will have it forever.,5
"Fascinating. Well researched look at success, culture and opportunity.",5
"Great Anecdotes and Insights, But Doesn’t Tie Back Together. Great anecdotes and insights, but the book doesn’t bother to tie these findings about circumstance back to the central theme of becoming a successful person or “outlier” yourself, which I assume is its mission. For some I imagine it would actually achieve the opposite goal, an existential fear of always being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” through its extreme determinist viewpoint. I still loved the book, but I think it may be harmful for certain people to think this way, especially if they weren’t very confident about themselves going in. [AUDIBLE]",3
"Unique Look at Success. Amazing book, great insight. Very unique way of looking at success and how different people were able to obtain success.",5
"Unique take. Outliers give us a unique take on success. But it does not give us many hands on tools for our own performance improvement. For this, I would highly recommend Full Throttle by Dr. Gregg Steinberg",5
"Must read!. Amazing book. LOVE. Top 5 favorite. Very fast read, lots of info, very informative!",5
Good. Good product,5
"Compelling. Gladwell is a very talented writer who has clearly put in 10,000 hours practicing his skills and has been lucky to have been given the opportunity to put those skills to use. I highly recommend this book.",4
"Encouraging but not useful... Avoid if you are looking for suggestions from the book. The first chapter is good, but the latter chapters are becoming worse. I gave up on the fourth chapter, so cannot say much about the things after that. But for the first several chapters, not many practical suggestions are given other than working hard. The main theme is genius is not born genius, they are ordinary people. But how can you replicate their success? Woops, the book just doesn’t care. Pretty disappointed... Might be an encouraging book, but far from being useful.",2
Five Stars. This is an interesting book and a pretty quick read.,5
"Well argued, a view I held.. Well argued. I related given my rural black South African upbringing. Have seen over and over how environment shaped the citizens.",5
"excelente lectura! un éxito más de Malcolm. Entretenido y lleno de datos interesantes! Un éxito más de Malcolm Gladwell! Explica a detalle las bases, suerte y hechos históricos de varios personajes exitosos!",5
intriguing. fascinating ties into cultural/societal topics. my open-mind grew just that much more. great stuff. thanks,5
"""If only I'd read this book earlier,"" the old man sighed. He shook his head sadly. ""I was at the wrong end of the cut-off age. I'd have made a champion swimmer..."". His voice trailed off.",4
"Yet another fan. This is a great book. Much more than the ""10,000 hour"" rule the book has become known for, it goes into detail on why and how we are a product of everything that has come before us. Some things are luck/chance, like being in the right place at the right time. But also how being aware of the things that have contributed to out personality, we can work with and grow beyond those things.",5
Fascinating. Better than Tipping Point and Freakonomics because Gladwell is able to tie shorter vignettes into a larger theme.,5
An Important Book. What you wished you always knew.,5
"Not my cup of tea. If you are looking for a page turner, this is not it. I had to read this for school and I couldn’t absorb anything because I kept spacing out",1
"but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers. This is an interesting book. I had never read ant of Gladwell's books, but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers.",3
Success is never achieved alone.. I read his books because of a Sixty Minutes piece.They never disappoint and show that we are the same of our parts and connections we cannot control. opportunity meets luck.,5
"Introspection. Gladwell's theories on success are interesting and definitely sparked some introspection. I enjoyed this work and my book club had a fascintating discussion about it. In fact, this book sparked multiple conversations with friends and relatives. It is definitely intriguing and inspiring.",4
"There's more to success than just working hard. Malcom outlines a number of scenarios contributing to success. I won't give away too much in the review but there are a number of cultural and community factors that helped create some of the most ""successful"" people. Many of us may not think luck plays a factor but this book tells otherwise. It was a great audiobook.",5
"Spellbinding. I haven't read other Gladwell books but from what I've heard, he's rather hit and miss. This is definitely a hit, starting with the excellent analysis of why so many ice hockey stars seem to be born early in the year and moving on to easy to read but insightful discussion of success in a range of fields. It's never boring, not a word wasted but is worth the price of purchase alone for the chapter titled ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"", which is about as stunning a chapter as I've read in non-fiction. I won't give away anything on that theory, just read it for yourself; it is truly fascinating.",5
"Unexpectedly interesting and thought provoking.. It was a remarkable study about all of the components which make up sucess and/or failure. Timing, luck, intellect, and emotional intelligence all play a part in creating a sucessful person.",4
"Nice overview. While you might not agree a 100% with all the success statements that Gladwell makes, his stories are fast to read and are overall enjoyable.",3
"Great read. Gladwell laboriously takes us through many great success stories, showing, in fact, success is not a matter of simply how hard you work. Rather success comes when people who work hard take advantage of opportunities, often extraordinary, which are presented to them.",5
"Sociologist and Social Thinkers. This book is an astute view of social issues and individual formation and progress in a postmodern world. The author does an excellent job of ""demythifying"" the ""Horatio Alger"" myths of our current world. The implications for individuals seeking control of their own destiny are astounding.",5
"Enlightening Insight into how Heritage, Hard Work and Luck Breeds Success. Outliers enlightens. It tells us that success isn't just a gift, but borne out of family history, dating back the ages; it's about luck, timing and old-fashioned hard work. About 10,000 hours honed on one skill will make you an expert.",3
Behavioral psychology meets Freakonimics! Get this book!. Do yourself a favor. Get this book. Read it and share its lessons with your children.,5
"Enriching!. It was a very enlightening experience, reading the book. A worthwhile read, time well spent. I like the thorough research and conclusions reached.",4
An Interesting Perspective worth understanding. I just have to say Malcolm I love how you weave thoughts and insightful stories into lessons of trying to understand the hows and sometimes whys we humans operate. Wish you could come to Kauai and share more with us here. Wondering with all that’s happening in the world in 2020 what your thoughts are. With your curious mind there must be a book or two in that lovely brain of yours...,5
It wasn't really what I was expecting. This book .... It wasn't really what I was expecting. This book was more of a study on Anthropology than a self-help book.,3
Great read for anyone interested on how success is achieved - it's will blow your mind.. What a wonderfully written book about how opportunity is the key factor to success. It really makes you think about your own life and the events that occurred during the earlier years that might have shaped you into what you are today. I don't often read books but this one was recommended to me by a few people and found that I had a hard time putting this book down. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested on how success is achieved - it will blow you away.,5
"Freedom.... This book has freed me to believe that much, much more is possible for my children. That the greatest things I can give them are opportunities & support- the kind of support that those from a cultural legacy different from mine would consider to be pushy! Frankly, I don't care. They will be outliers.",5
Four Stars. Another well done book by Gladwell. It does jump around some.,4
"why some succeed and some do not. I , having a mid year birthday, made note of those born in January and also those in December and that the year's difference in age made a difference in their schooling. I have also done some ethnic profiling, noting in a general way that ethnicity can influence what may be termed aptitudes. Of course, any book which supports one's own views is going to get rave reviews from its readers. It is certainly worth a read.",5
"Not my favorite. I kept waiting for the meaning of the book until the last page. The facts were interesting, but I got very little from this book except that success takes time and commitment.",2
"Thought provoking. I think the author is over emphasizing the role of luck. While he makes a compelling case with great anecdotal evidence, I think classifying people like Bill Gates our Steve Jobs as ordinary people presented with extraordinary opportunities is not giving due credit to what makes these outliers such super achievers.",5
"D&G was better.. Gladwell broke his own thesis by chapter 2. In David and Goliath, the points he proves completely contradict the ones made here.",2
"Wonderful interesting quick read. Outliers is filled with interesting facts and figures. This book will keep you reading long after you thought you would stop for the day. You don't often hear the word ""fun"" associated with a book but this was fun to read.",5
GREAT BOOK MUST READ. This book is an amazing read I don't read much but this is an amazing book that give you a new perspective on how the people we see as successful got to where they are and the trues reasoniNguyen behind it worth the buy amazing book highly recommended,5
The book had some wear signs. The book had some wear signs,4
Fair. fantastic book ..,3
A must-read. One of the best and most important books I have read.,5
Changing my perspective. Simply written book with inspiring anecdotes that show how success is really a combination of random events and hard work.,5
Essential reading. Everyone need to read this book.,5
"Acknowledging success as it really is in reality. Although the book is a bit long for its core message, it is a great read.",4
Good book. I am late to the Gladwell game and I thought this book had some interesting points and observations to make.,4
Five Stars. Excellent read!! I'm keeping this for my collection!! Definitely a worthy purchase!,5
Five Stars. Great Book!,5
"Very interesting.. This was a well written, well performed book. I thoroughly enjoyed it as my first introduction to Malcolm Gladwell's works. I look forward to reading more from him.",5
"Very interesting.. You might be discouraged by this book but the content is absolutely interesting. It is another way to look at life, and another way to look at successful people.",4
Five Stars. Informative and interesting.,5
My husband;s choice for an Xmas present !. My husband is interested in financial matters and he really wanted this book ! The author has written many books and my husband has enjoyed all of them !,5
Why did I not read this earlier?. This was a very helpful book for me as an educator. I love Malcom’s perspective and insight.,5
"Which was perfect, because I was 2 days late to ordering .... The 1 book I had to read in college that wasn't a drag.",5
Five Stars. Great book! I like his style and readability.,5
"""Outliers"". Without question the most interesting book I have .... ""Outliers"". Without question the most interesting book I have ever read (and I am in my seventies). Gladwell gave me inf. that I didn't know existed. Who would have thought that Korean airlines crashes was due to the culture that the flight crew grew up in. Or why did the Hatfields &McCoys, and other similar geographic clans, react the way they did. I am now reading ""What The Dog Saw"".",5
"loved it, inspiring and enlightening.. loved it, inspiring and enlightening. Outlier's made me realize that, in terms of how to be successful, there is more than meets the eye.",5
"Statistical Stupidity. In a culture of conformity, it doesn't take a rocket scientist or even a statistician to predict that success is predicated on an individual's environment. This is not a book about outliers. It is a statistical substitution of social determinism for true accomplishment.",1
Excellent book. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting as I couldn't put it down. Interesting and thought-provoking.,5
Its good.. It was recommended to me by a friend and so far am enjoying it (as an e-book). It's been a good read with a lot of anecdotal explanations about the nature of success.,4
"Success - Defined as so much more than any individual alone can determine.. I found this book presents a different and interesting way to look at what contributes to success. This makes you realize that there is so much more to what determines how we become who we are, the chances that we have access to based on so much more than we realize. It provides a broadening of perspective and a thought provoking larger world view as it applies to each and every one of us.",4
This is outlier. I enjoyed every bit of the book. Very well documented and fun to read. Malcolm Gladwell definitely knows how to keep your attention.,5
"So much more than just genius and talent. When you were born, to whom you were born, where you were born, how hard you work, how your culture molds your values and behavior. It goes on and on. Gladwell has some intriguing theories that he defends well. He breaks the book up into case studies that ""prove"" various points of his thesis. They are all interesting, but my favorite was the one about his own family history in Jamaica.",5
Great book. Greatly recommended AAA read!,5
"Fascinating. From sports champions to plane crashes, he ties everything together in such a compelling way.",5
I simply am overwhelmed and grateful for this book. I have learned more about why I am where I am and even my own culture (Jamaican) after reading this book than I’ve learned in my 16 years of education! I definitely recommend it and will be reading it like a bible to attain my own successes!,5
"Terrific Read!. Gladwell does a remarkable job of connecting ideas that, at first glance, seem utterly unrelated. Step by step, Gladwell brilliantly dissects societal patterns to explain why various individuals were outliers in history. This book causes one to reflect on all the incredible opportunities and people in ones own story.",5
"A challenge to think.... This book challenges the reader's assumptions about why some people ""succeed"" and others do not. Like other books written by this author, you have to put aside traditional thinking and seriously consider that ""he just might be right!"" This book should be required reading for parents,grandparents, and educators.",5
"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2
"good book. very intriguing. some excellent points made about how outliers are really the product of environment, circumstance, and opportunities.",4
"... conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work .... A very interesting read at the start but the conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work ethic, be born at the right time, get the lucky breaks, and be from a middle class to reach the very top in the sport, business or music industries. Well what a surprise!",4
Five Stars. Infinitely interesting.,5
Q gracias todo llego muy bien. Llego como se mira en la foto gracias excelente y muy barato,5
Insightful. This audible book helped me enjoy my chores and workout! Enjoyable read with great insights.,5
They are lucky. Luck accounts for 90% of success.,4
"Too long. My interest was held. In success, opportunity, cultural inheritance and hard work play key roles.",3
Fascinating. Excellent read would recommend reading it through twice. Now annoyed that my parents didn't have me earlier in the decade and later in the year,4
Yea a good buy. As usual flipkart delivered very rapidly.,5
So far excellent book. Easy to read but very intuitive into .... Haven’t finished it. So far excellent book. Easy to read but very intuitive into why some people become successes and others aren’t.,5
"Very Humbling. Great book! It breaks down a lot of misconceptions about success and systematically explains how a person's success is hardly their own doing, rather an amalgam of culture, hard work, and good old-fashioned luck.",4
"Great buy. Great book.. This book will open your eyes and give you another look at what makes successful people. Really interesting! I have kids with late birthdays to I can relate the information concerning Canadian hockey players. My son is a dec birthday .... Guess what... He did not excel at hockey that had a dec 31 cutoff date. Even if you do not agree with everything, it does give you a new perspective and makes you think.",5
Good Read. Really awesome read so far.,4
Five Stars. I would recommend this book!,5
"Not worth it. The main point of this book is that successful people aren't successful just because of their efforts but also because they got lucky in some ways, for instance Bill Gates was lucky enough to have been a young curious man with access to a computer in a time when it was very hard to get access to a computer.",1
Fascinating. Required reading for my college freshman and well .... Fascinating. Required reading for my college freshman and well worth reading as her mentor.,5
"A fascinating journey. Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. Outliers definitely does not disappoint. It uses excellent, very specific examples about stories of successful people and organizations throughout history. The section The Three Lessons of Joe Flom has an interesting tie-in to the RJR Nabisco merger and buyout which can be read about in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. Once I started this I couldn't put it down. As always I look forward to reading more books from Mr. Gladwell.",5
"Outliers: The Story of Success. Excellent book - complex and yet simple, engaging and yet written in an accessible style, provocative and yet balanced. I will look for more from this writer.",5
"Duh. The blurb for the book says, ""In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"".""",2
I skimmed this book instead of reading it. I didn’t entirely love it.,3
"A must read. Excellent book! It was my book club selection. When I heard it was a non-fiction about how to be successful I thought I would be bored. Well, was I wrong. I couldn't put it down. It was fascinating . I have recommended it to everyone I know.",5
Great Read. I loved this book! I highly recommend it to all of my friends and family members. Malcolm Gladwell really did a great job of showing what a success story is and how anyone can be successful; it's all about who is going to take advantage of what is given. Definitely re reading and passing along the messages that I have taken away from it.,5
"Definitely recommend!. Just read it, amazing book!",5
"Love it, Love it, Love it. The beauty of a gift. Thanks for being a gift Malcom. The work that was necessary to compile this i would guess is a lot. Thanks for doing it and making it available.",5
Nothing. My daughter loved this book,5
Amazing stories and Challenging truths!. One of the most gripping non-fiction books I've read to date. The statistics were intriguing and the connections made are the result of extraordinary divergent thinking. A must read for those who are interested in success!,5
interesting. i think there could have been more example's of people that had great,3
"A Humbling Look into the Reality of Success. An insightful examination of myriad factors and forces that pave the path to success. Lineage, sociocultural conditions, and education, leveraged by sheer determination of will and relentless pursuit of growth opportunities create outliers - those individuals whose success or accomplishments are evident to others. While they may have worked 10,000 hours to reach a specific goal (see Beatles story in the book), it took more than practice to achieve success.",5
"This is not an inspirational story if you are looking for one. Outlier is just a product of luck and effort, but mostly luck according to the author. It feels like it’s depend on your society, community and your early education. Not sure if I like this book or not. But agree that one must work hard and work smart.",3
"Excellent Read, Freshman-College level required reading. Have you ever wondered why some people make it and some people don't? Malcolm Gladwell exams this question through interviews with many persons",5
"Great concepts. Totally different view of success as we know, very interesting read. Well written and easy to follow, the examples used really help tell a story.",5
"Great book: Best read after a while.... I've also read a few other books like The tipping point, Blink and Talking to strangers written by Malcolm Gladwell these all are gems. Outliers is also a great volume of an extraordinary series of books.",5
"Great book!. Shows how Amazing people got where they are with a combination of luck, skill, opportunity, and hard work",5
Stories Stick. this stories stuck with me and I I'm able to share them with others. learned a lot about those who became outstanding and the lessons seem applicable.,5
"Excellent perspective view on success achieving. Great analysis of evident cause of success that is clouded by notion of genius in our time. Lots of kids who think they are geniuses may benefit from this book, come down from their cloud based thoughts and start working hard on building their seed of genius into actual success. We'll summed up notion that hard meaningful work pays back for everyone who does it.",4
"Good Value. Ship Faster and the book looks like a new. Just cover edge little bit bent, inside was good. Good value",5
"Excellent. This was an excellent book, so good infancy I read it twice in succession.",5
"Fantastic!. Success is just the opportunity to work hard, as proven over and over again here. What can we do as a society ro give more people this opportunity? I just love the thought provoking questions asked and the perspectives offered. well worth the listen.",5
"An Eye Opener. This book describes why some individuals seem to excell and others do not. Every chapter takes on a different group and explain what has led to their success. The analysis is so interesting particularly when the reader realizes what has been going on right before his/her eyes. The chapter on Canadian Hockey Players leaves the listener wondering ""why didn't I see that?"" The section on when children should start to Kindergarten is helpful as well. I subscribe to Audible to be informed about areas foreign to me. This book is one I am glad I didn't miss. The reading is great, the audio clear, the content easy to follow.",5
"Five Stars. Great purchase, satisfied customer.!",5
Malcolm is Awesome. listen and be fascinated by Gladwell's view of the world. he is awesome. why does a review need to be fifteen words?????,5
"Who knew? Data applied to our lives. Great tales of the human condition, and how rare and unusual facts contribute to our world and the people who live on this mortal coil.",4
Gift. This was purchased for a student as part of required reading.,4
Fantastic. Gladwell challenges preconceived notions of success through an incredibly well thought analysis of cultural outliers,5
"Good quality book. Not so fun to read.. It wasn't that great of a book to read, but it was required for me to read. However the book came on time, and it was in good condition. It smelled a little weird, but almost every paperback book does.",5
good factual book..... .....based on research and facts about why people are successful. The facts endorse that it is circumstances taht make you succesfull...,4
"An Intriguing Read..... This book covers intersting social factors that may determine successful individuals. The author makes you think about culture, educational achievement, and hard work in a new way. As it is an entertaining read, the applied economic theories are a bit stretched. Overall, I would recommend Outliers but, follow it up with a book written by a true economist.",4
Brilliant and Challenging. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell since The Tipping Point and this book is no exception. His study of education is the finest part of the book but every chapter is fascinating. His discussion of race and skin tone using his own genealogy is one of the bravest things I've ever read.,5
Five Stars. Thought-provoking and interesting.,5
a great. Very interesting book.....a great read,5
Interesting book. I really enjoyed this book. it was eye opening to read about the different factors that led to success for people like Bill Gates. definitely recommend.,4
"Excellent, outstanding, well written Book. This is one book that I couldn't put down. Every sentence, every chapter. Very compelling book. Mr. Gladwell really puts his heart and soul into the book and the research done on is fascinating.",5
"I highly recommend this book. The book provides incredible insights into the top-tier successes in our society. The information is incredibly insightful and thought provoking. So much so, that after I started reading Outliers, I did not put it down until I had finished it. It gave me a deeper understanding on how some influences in my childhood played a role in who I have grown up to be. I highly recommend this book.",5
Outliers review. Educators should especially listen to this book tape. It is well worth the understanding they will receive in educating students.,5
"Five Stars. Love, love, love this book. Blew my mind and brought about so much awareness. Highly recommended!",5
Love this book - just read for second time. So many useful ideas in this book and love the data that sits behind everything. Well written,5
Interesting. Interesting read,4
"Can you, too, become a super star?. First, full disclosure: I know Malcolm Gladwell. He was a guest speaker in my course ""Creativity and Personal Mastery"" at Columbia Business School and he held my class spellbound. I LOVE his pieces in the New Yorker and his earlier books.",5
"A different book. I was told how good this book was so I purchased it. It is a different approach to the subject of doing well in ones work. It gives a good outlook on those who may not be considered ""winners"". It was a challenging book for sure and I would recommend it to all those who want to succeed in life.",4
"Four and a half stars. A good book that reveals how success is more related to history and circumstance than it might at first seem,especially in cases of success that are often put down to genius.",4
It is a book!. A very good and interesting read.,4
Interesting. I liked some of the insights and suggestions to deal with the revelations exposed in the book. It was eye opening and enjoyable.,4
"Classic, Persuasive. In this book Gladwell makes a strong case for what it takes to be successful, and that people we think of as outliers are not really outliers at all.",5
Excellent. A good motivational book for people who can amend a few changes in their creative routine.,5
"Five Stars. I like all of Gladwell's stuff, very inelligent info, but easy to understand.",5
Read it twice. This book is so great. I conducted a weekly reading group with it. People who read it are still talking about the genious of Malcolm Gladwell. My grand children read it in high school. A family friend read it in college. It is an award-winning book!,5
Five Stars. thought provoking,5
Insightful and interesting!. Malcolm does well in this book. He looks at the conventional wisdom of success and challenges is using well researched historical and current examples. Definitely worth a listen,4
Five Stars. A good read.,5
Great read.. Great read.,5
Like. I liked that this book gave a perception of that what an outlier is and also made us feel encouraged that each of us has a distinct purpose.,5
A Must read!!. The author gives us a very insightful perspective on how we look at success in our society. The book gives us a more in depth look at how advantages and opportunities play a major role in success.,5
Five Stars. I found this a very interesting book.,5
"Every Chapter Gets Better. It is a book I'll definitely listen to again. Interesting to learn how people succeed beyond ones wildest imagination and it has nothing to do because they are ""smart"" or have a high ""IQ."" So worth listening. Be patient, it's a good one.",5
Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. What a fascinating book!,4
Five Stars. my husband loved it!,5
"great book. Great reading, It will widen your horizon and see things in different perspective.",5
geeat book. Nice book. Made me really think. The hockey chapter as well as the plane crashes one really opened my mind to be more of a critical thinker.,5
Four Stars. Read this in college and loved it so got a copy for my son. Great read.,4
Excellent book!. It highlights how circumstances can allow for success.,5
"Five Stars. Excellent product, excellent seller!!!",5
Love the book. Love the book! Malcom Gladwell is a terrific writer and always leaves you with something to think about. I highly recommend all of his books.,5
"Amazing book! Read it now!. This book did a fantastic job explaining ""Lucky people"" or ""talent geniuses​"". Many times they have situations that drove them to their success. ""A good time to be alive"".",5
"Bravo. So glad to have discovered Gladwell through the New Yorker and recommendations. His work is fascinating, well crafted and beautifully delivered. Well done!",5
Another Winner!. Another winner for Malcolm Gladwell. A life changer and a small seed of knowledge that continues to impact my everyday world.,5
"Are we doomed to mediocrity?. Having completed the fascinating and awe-inspiring summary of Mr Gladwell's research, I verge on extreme depression thinking that if we are not outliers the rest of us are doomed to mediocrity. Without 10,000 hours of experience, we are merely ""also-rans"". Thus, I will continue to focus on being thankful to be running at all.",5
A must read. Reading this books gives you a new understanding of the forces that contribute to our success.,5
Amazing!. Highly recommended for a great reflection on your life! The author gives plenty of examples to make points thus validating his theories..,5
"his best book yet.... I have to say that I really loved this book, and was sorry to reach the last page. I liked Blink and Tipping Point, but I thought this one made a bigger impact on my thinking about several important subjects. Great observations and insights from a gifted writer make for a great read.",5
"SO GOOD!. I love to read. How did I not know about Malcom Gladwell??? A true genius of our time. I’ve read The Tipping Point, Outliers and now David and Goliath. I don’t know if I’ve ever read 3 books by the same author who is so solid EVERY TIME.",5
"Makes you think. I love any book that makes me think about things in new ways. I was hesitant at first to get this for the price of it, as I have been reading the free classics for a while, but I have heard much about it and been wanting to read it for a while, so I just treated myself. I enjoyed it and it gave you lots of great examples about how people become great many times due to things that put them in places at the right time. Treat yourself to the book if you have been wanting to read it for a while.",5
"Outstanding Book! I have bought additional copies for friends.. I have bought several copies of the book and given them to executive collegues of mine. I was amazed, but some of the observations paid immediate dividends with a $2 billion dollar project I am running.",5
Another great book from Malcolm Gladwell. excellent book ! Very educational and insightful about what we may have always taken for granted.,5
Best book. pretty interesting book! I guarantee you will like it.,4
Four Stars. enjoyed this different ways of viewing success.,4
"I'm sure as hell damn good at what I do right now. I bought this book sometime in 2014 and since I just had to post a review for another book I just read, I've decided to share my thoughts on this book as well.",5
Make you think. Gladwell does a great job of making you think about successful people in a different light. He basically says that there are other events that occurred along the way that helped them become successful...no one does it alone.,5
"Excellent book..remarkable!!. This book narrates a theory of success unlike no other. It provides the reader with research-based data, and real life anecdotes that keeps the reader interested and intrigued about what lies ahead!!",5
"More people need to read this. This book clarified and substantiated many of the thoughts I was having. I was wondering why I didn't fall into a ""good"" job when I graduated from college in 2009. Now it all makes sense.",5
Full of information on Famous people. I read this in three days while I waited for my wife to get read in the morning. The stories are very succinct and packed with information I would never have even thought about. I never knew anything about Bill Gates other that he started Microsoft with Paul Allen.,5
Five Stars. Best College required reading ever,5
An amazing and enlightening read. One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. It really makes you think about what you are doing in your life that could change.,5
"Good read. The book was great. It was delivered on time and come in perfect condition. Very interesting to read the little stories in it, quite eye opening. Overall I would recommend this book to others that all looking for a little something different than a regular fiction book.",4
great read. Recommended by a young smart teenager to me. Really opens up your mind to looking at people and possibilities differently. I recommend this book to everyone.,5
Well written. Interesting,5
"Fascinating!. The author takes a different approach to the subject and there are a lot of ""ah ha!"" moments. It's a fun and easy read for sure.",5
"Pretty good read.. Overall this is a pretty good book. The text is well written and a very informational, however, at times seems to lose focus of the overall topic. Yet despite this minor flaw, this book is a must read. Author Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job.",4
Really enjoyed this book. Fascinating read. Really enjoyed this book.,5
Five Stars. A fascinating study into success. Very enlightening,5
"The real story behind success.. Excellent study of how so many success stories are due to special circumstances instead of the actual talent, among other aspects.",4
Great addition to literature on success. This is a well written book that is a great addition to literature on success. It keeps you engaged and summaries it's points well. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic of why some people do poorly and why others have so much success in different areas of life.,5
love it!. must read! love it!,4
Five Stars. Interesting facts not considered in standard thoughts on an array of subjects.,5
"thought provoking. I really enjoyed this book. I definitely think differently about people with great success. Gladwell... If the opportunity presented itself, how many of us would be in a position to use out talents to rise to the top?",5
It is a book!. A very good and interesting read.,4
"Outliers. A thought provoking book about what the ""recipe"" for success is. Definitely worth reading when you have small children or are planning a family.",3
Priceless information!. A great outside of the box perspective on success. A priceless eye opener worth sharing.,5
Statistical quirks for Dummies. I have just been sucked in by a book that is about statistical anomalies. That can't be right ...,5
"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",5
Really makes you think. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It really make you think about what it takes to be successful.,5
This is among the best of them. All of Gladwell's books are well worth reading. This is among the best of them. Mr. Gladwell is a good writer and writes in an interesting style. I recommend this and all of his books.,4
Enlightening. This book was an incredible read and difficult to put down. This showed me areas of life I did not think about before. There is no way someone can read this book and not get anything out of it. Malcolm Gladwell is now one of my favorite authors. I look forward to reading his other books. The best part is writing about areas that you may not find in other books. You can see the creativity of Malcolm and the passion that drove him write this.,5
"New Way to think about things. Worth the pick. I did enjoy learning to see things through a different light. At the end of the day, achievement and success might not be as far fetched as it is made out to be.",4
"A book that in a nutshell comes down to being .... A book that in a nutshell comes down to being born at the right time and/or place. For the rest, if you want to succeed, then you have to put in 10k hours of effort to become an expert in a particular subject.",3
Five Stars. Great book,5
"Fascinating. This is not my first Gladwell book. I find his perspective fascinating. During my review of the book, I did occasionally think to myself that some of his conclusions are based on anecdote. however overall, I believe that he had an important perspective to the mythology of personal success and rugged individualism. It was a page-turner. I do recommend this book highly to anybody interested in understanding all of the components that go into making a successful individual.",4
"Success, redefined.. Malcolm Gladwell tells a story, using statistical samples and everyday examples that apply to most people. He reveals the true hard work of becoming an outlier, a 'freak of nature.'",5
I love this book. I purchased this as a gift. I love this book. Full of interesting information and analysys.,5
Five Stars. exellent,5
"Outstanding.... Quite extraordinary. A thought provoking, iconoclastic examination of the unseen systems that create success and how we can identify them to better our world.",5
"Interesting Angle, But Acknowledge the Work Done. This is a great book and it definitely brings up some incredible points! It fails to hit on one important point though: the people discussed in the stories still had to put in an incredible amount of work. This point is barely touched on, almost passed over. Yes the people discussed had incredible opportunity thanks to the times and locations and even months they were born. But this is never enough. You still have to put in the work. The author almost makes it seem like anyone could have been Bill Gates born under the right conditions. I disagree. Not everyone with access to a computer in the late 1960’s would get out of bed at 2:30AM to program at 3:00AM. Plain and simple. The outliers are the people who engaged in incredibly hard work, and had some luck and help and opportunity along the way. The work still had to be done though. I agree with what the author is saying mostly, and yet I find it a bit discrediting to people’s achievements. I believe this is the other extreme of the individualism scale talking. Listen to the book and draw your own conclusions. Definitely a worthwhile read though and time well spent. Excellent book!",4
"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",5
"Painfully Boring!!!. My opinion is that the author came up with an idea of what made some people successful and then ""backed into"" the supporting evidence. He is extremely redundant and downright boring at times. His opinions could have been summed up in a 10 page book.",1
Great book on success for teens. Very interesting facts about success especially. About the Beatles. TRied to buy it for a teenager interested in music at the local store but it was sold out. SOme high schools are requiring it for students.,5
fascinating. really a fascinating book about people we consider exceptional. well read and clear. highly recommend,5
"Engaging but doubtful. A compelling argument, however a potentially misleading one. The book is heavily based on anecdotal evidence, with barely no statistical data to confirm we are actually seeing causation rather than random coincidence.",3
"Must read for people suspicious of the Horatio Alger ""rags to riches"" stories. Malcolm Gladwell really hit the ball out of the park with this book. I've always been skeptical of the notion that all a person needs to do to become successful is simply ""lift oneself up by one's bootstraps"" and just do it.",5
"Easy to read and informative. Well written book, very interesting. Easy to read and informative, food for thought.",5
"An important book. I first listened to this book a few years ago, and it is atill one of my favorite books. I have recommended it to many people since then. Malcom Gladwell does a masterful job addressing the factors that contribute to the ultra-successful, the &quot;outliers.&quot; From Bill Gates to the Beatles to Robert Oppenheimer.",5
Five Stars. Fascinating!,5
Five Stars. Summer reading,5
"Outlier. Malcolm Gladwell is one of my top authors, love his stuff, read Blink and Tipping Point, and again he does not dissapoint with his insightful material that just puts things in different perspectives that just make too much damn sense. You may end up getting a new spark of confidence to feel that you can make things work for you and act upon opportunity; and if you can't you will feel fine too because maybe it just wasn't meant to capitalize on certain things due to the place and time you were born in. Cultural Legacy is I believe the most important concept spoken that our Educational institutions should implement and be able to provide that to a child to be able to perform better in life, regardless of the socio-economical background. Regardless, a great read!",5
Great product and service!. Great product and service!,5
"Expected nothing less. What can I say, Malcolm is a genius and I love all his books.",5
Outliers: The Story of Success. I liked Tipping Point better. Outliers is an interesting concept but some of the stories of outliers seemed contrived. Gladwell includes his own family story in the concluding chapter.,3
It's okay. Good product.,3
"Excellent, thought provoking read. Well written, well, researched book. It makes sense on so many levels, wish it could be implemented by the state.",5
"Book Great - Amazon's vendor disappointed me. Malcolm Gladwell is a most intelligent writer who presents his thoughts, opinions and factual results of various events and research for reaching the conclusions he presents in this and his other books.",5
"Excelent Writing. A very interesting take on a subject we take very lightly. Surprising facts and insights make this a very entertaining read, and a learning experience",5
Great book. Great book,5
Worth the money. Nice,4
Great read!. My son had to read this book in 7th grade for a report. My husband was helping him and read some of it to be able to help him better. He was so interested in it that my son decided to purchase it for him for a Christmas gift.,5
"Fun anecdotal book which gives pause for thought.. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell, though find it important to take his writing for what it is: as an inspiration to think along his lines. His books tend to be somewhat drawn out, with long anecdotes to support his claims. Although somewhat tedious at times, they serve to help the reader remember his key points.",4
"It was a great consumer experience. It came in the exact condition as described. You get what you buy. It was a great consumer experience. And if I might add, it was a really good read. It was very thought-provoking, and it truly opened my eyes to see how the influences around you change how you think, live, and succeed in life.",5
"Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on .... Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on LUCK! This book has changed my world! As a hard worker, there were times when I didn't understand why my hard work didn't produce success, or that it would take so long to see results...but now I understand very clearly that sometimes it's just a matter of waiting for LUCK to show up and being prepared when it does!",5
For all self-made Successes. Hard work and perseverance bear fruit but don’t fool yourself into thinking that its enough and that it entitles you to scorn those at a lower level. We have a lot to learn......,5
Encouraging tool. Excellent life examples that help to make a plan or mision to accomplish a life project. Everybody can make a difference!,4
Good read!!. Awesome book to read!! This book is intriguing and interesting to read. I enjoyed reading it as it was interesting to see the thought process behind it.,5
"Will change the way you look at information. This book has some incredible stories and a new way of looking at the narrative of success. I have been thinking about the data that proves our schools vacation time is a bigger problem for students learning than how our teachers are teaching. Why has it not received more attention!? It has so many implications that are ""solvable"" and some that are not expensive.",5
"Entertaining and fun, but not compelling. Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style. His writing is beautiful. The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",5
Gladwell scores again. I'm always up for Malcolm Gladwell's work. He takes complex global concepts and distills them down into useful ideas to enhance our day-to-day lives.,5
"Very Good. Must read book for everyone! It keeps you motivated with the purpose and skills you want to acquire. I loved this book throughout and it has a great connection. Don’t bother yourself with the difficult circumstance, you should keep going and excel yourself with the skills and follow your passion one day you will strike the target and achieve your goals. Must read for those who want to achieve something good in life and who dream big",4
Five Stars. Best book I've read in a really long time.,5
Great Book. I had to have this for my ROTC class in college and I honestly would have read it outside of the class.,5
Interesting story but should’ve left the narration to the pros. Interesting story but should’ve left the narration to the pros.. Gladwell almost manages to ruin a good story with his flat narration.,5
Five Stars. I really enjoyed this book it is amazing,5
"Good book! I even bought a copy for my .... Good book! I even bought a copy for my son to read. He's in college. The part Mr. Gladwell doesn't really discuss is the spiritual component of the stories he brings up in the book though. At the beginning he mentions this Italian town that moved to America and their great success. He mentions their faith as a key component to their success in this introduction story, but never brings it up again. Without this developed piece the book feels like it is missing something. But, even so, it is a great book. Very thought provoking!",5
A Book That Benefits Various/Several People!. I found this book to be very interesting and can see how it could benefit various types of people. From those business savvy people who wish to do better business by making changes in the way they do or see things rather than changing the product to psychologist or a self help book. I thought it was so interesting the various results from studies such as the birth month of hockey players; the timing for those to become successful; how the different races paved the way for their success and so on.  have read Blink as well and enjoyed that too but enjoyed this book better. I have gone ahead and obtained Malcolm's two other books but will be surprised if I enjoy either of them more than I enjoyed this one.,5
Outliers. I really enjoy reading this book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Gladwell gave many stories on life with people that became successful.,5
"When were you born?. Well written, thought provoking book. A very good read.",4
Five Stars. Great book. Very insightful.,5
"The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks ma. The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born.  These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.  thought the first half of Outliers was interesting as Gladwell talks about months and years people are born that may factor into a person success.  was more or less bored reading the second half which discussed families, and locations that define how hard you are going to work to be successful.  I also did not agree some of the facts discussed in the second half. utliers is an interesting read.  I picked it because some of the other books I had been reading mentioned it.   I would be interested in some of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s other books.",4
"Debunking the myth of ""self-made men"".. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book.  So appreciative to hear a voice of humility amid all the boasting arrogance of success. Thank you for setting the record straight.",5
Outliers an Interesting Alternative Viewpoint. A quick paced and interesting listen that has plenty of familiar names and examples to create a very reasoned explanation for some amazingly accomplished individuals.,4
"Life changing book. Wonderful stories, amazing analogy!",5
"How Success Happens. A better understanding of background, constraints, industriousness, and happenstance converge to create or stiffle success!",5
Outstanding. The content of the book is outstanding. I just can't phantom why it took so long to discover this fine book. It reinforced my general believes and improved my knowledge on several aspects of life. A must read/listened to.,5
.. Mind blowing,5
Worth the read!. Definitely a read that makes you think and look at the world differently. A must in your library.,5
"An interesting look at what creates success. In this wide-ranging third installment of Malcolm Gladwell's exploration of how people and social phenomena work, the New Yorker journalist takes a close look at what constitutes high levels of success. That is, what makes people at the top of their respective fields get there? As we've come to expect from Gladwell's previous books, the answer to the question is a bit complicated.<br /><br />He says that upbringing, culture and even random luck have something to with success, but there is another important quality that anyone can control. Two chapters are dedicated to the ""revelation"" that IQ is only a baseline quality and success has little to nothing to do with having a high IQ or a low IQ. Rather, success is substantially a product of cultivating a high degree of what Robert Sternberg calls ""practical intelligence"" or what most refer to as ""emotional intelligence.""<br /><br />Gladwell uses the example of Nobel laureates coming from unknown schools as often as ivy league schools. At this level of mastery IQ is no longer a factor. Success has little to do with where you were educated and everything to do with your level of practical/emotional intelligence and willingness to put in the 10,000 hours of practice required to reach mastery of your field.<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting read that isn't too heady and goes by pretty quickly, as the interesting anecdotes are what you would expect from Gladwell.<br /><br />Another book on the topic that I strongly recommend because it has been really helpful to me in actually applying what Gladwell teaches in my own life (for my own success!) is The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book.",5
Great...again. Glad well continues to !improve upon his previous great books. He finds the important details everyone else misses! Keep it up Malcolm,5
Inspiring and Insightful. Simply one of the best books I've read in recent memory. Gladwell makes Outliers an easy yet enjoyable and provocative read. Must buy.,5
"My favorite Gladwell book so far. My favorite Gladwell book so far. I think I have read at least four of his books. Certain chapters really captivated me. Some of those were about birthdates, timing and certain things that had to be lined up for certain people to succeed, the 10,000-hour concept, and the plane crash chapter.",5
"Depressing, not inspiring. While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas. For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.",2
Very Good. This is a very good book and an eye opener. I wonder how some of the concepts apply to what is going on today and what kind of successful people we will see in the future.,4
"The Book Outliers is a Must Read. Malcolm Gladwell is a must read for Parents, Teachers, Coaches, and others that help develop children. Malcolm has done a terrific job at linking the true traits of success in developing future leaders in business and sports. Thanks, David Eldridge, Marketing Director of RedSunDomains.com",5
Good book. Really good read.,5
Five Stars. Interesting and great fun to read,5
Fascinating!. This is my second time buying this book.,5
One the best books ever written. A MUST READ!!! One the best books ever written.,5
"Great read. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Loved this book, and everyone I know that has read this loves it too. Informative, and a bit inspiring. After completion of this, You may have an understanding of where you stand mentally. It may motivate or inspire. The choice is yours.",5
"Perspective Changing. This book changed my way of perceiving the achievent of sucess and how talent is less important than we think for reaching it. Gladwell picked great and interesting examples to prove his argument. It's a delightful book and I'll surely recommend it to my friends, especially for the ones who are about to be parents. ""The 10000 hours rule"" made me think how important pratice and nurturing is important when you are raising your kid.",5
Three Stars. Very insightful with regards to transparent social patterns that make people more susceptible in becoming outliers.,3
Motivational. I truly enjoyed this book and have recommended it several times.,5
Better than Blink. Excellent book - great insight and very well written. Gladwell is an excellent author and this is one of my favourite pieces.,5
Educational.. Very informative.,5
One of the best. This is one of Mr. Gladwell's best books as he put his heart and sole into this one. You can also find out why by listening to his confession at the end of the book.,5
"Mongongo Nuts and Chinese Math. After reading this book, I am ready to learn about Mongongo Nuts. They are available but I must also find cultivation information.",5
"A great source for gaining a wider world perspective.. The blending of research from multiple disciplines into a new scientific perspective helps us understand our world and how it operates. The approach taken by Gladwell is thought provoking and well supported, and should be read by all students (12+) and all adults looking for and interesting perspecitve on the world, and their own social setting.",5
Five Stars. Amazing book,5
"Best gift for anyone. My boss recommended this book, and the moment I finished it, I wish I would have read it in high school. Or at least college.",5
Everyone should read this book!. One of the most interesting and thought provoking books I have read.,5
Five Stars. What a wonderful new way of looking at the world!,5
Best Read Ever. I loved this book. it is the type of book that shifts your thinking. The author backs his opinion up with many solid examples. I walked away with many learning gains from this books teachings. I am off to read his next book.,5
"Great book!. This was really fascinating and I found myself not only thinking about the ideas Mr. Gladwell brought up, but discussing them with others as well. I bought the audio book version to listen to on my drive to and from work and actually found myself looking forward to my commute each day! Great book!",5
"Great Read..... This was my first time reading a Malcolm Gladwell book. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and had planned on reading it on vacation. The only problem was that there was about 6 weeks between when I received the book (ahead of schedule, by the way) and when I planned to leave. I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read. Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of ""pop-science"" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book. I must say that I never found myself wishing for more substance, I thought this was a good book, it brings to light many interesting ideas and thoughts. This book also inspired me to purchase 3 more Gladwell books, and I'm working my way through them now.",5
a must read!. great book a must read!,5
"Interesting and insightful. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell quite a bit. Each of his books offers a bit of a different take on a main topic. I think that Outliers is one of my more favorites, probably because it felt like there was more stories.",5
"Great Book!. First off, the supplier did a good job shipping the book in time and in good condition.",5
"Informative, but overall kind of common sense.. I rated it 4 stars becauseit was well written and obviously thoroughly researched. The overall message, however is not that esoteric or secret.",4
Great read!. My 22 year old son also read this book and found it inspirational. Thanks Malcolm!,5
Good sized book to fit in your luggage or handbag. Not finished this yet (40 per cent through ) but book arrived in gold quality as per Amazon standard. Interesting book about the impact of socio economic factors and luck paved the way for some of the world's most recognisably successful entrepreneurs/athletes.,5
Great book!. A professor recommended it. So glad I ordered it and read it. Really great read!,5
Excellent book. Excellent read! Really makes you think of your own success' and how and why. As well as it could happen to anyone and all the factors that go into success. It makes everything just click in your head is the best way to describe it.,5
Four Stars. Interesting book,4
"Wow, interesting.. Malcolm Gladwell 's book is a fascinating collection of root causes. There are a multitude of answers to questions that I had never thought to ask. Malcolm Gladwell explores the roots of success to a depth that I never would have considered without provocation. I really enjoyed this book. I look forward to enjoying many new aha moments as I read the other books written by Mr. Gladwell. I had selected this book in hopes of discovering some recipe that I might employ to foster the interests of my children. I had hoped to discover the formula for helping to cultivate/ foster their ultimate success. This book did a great deal to inform my thinking. I do hope for a perfect storm of unique opportunities for each of them, but my strongest hope still remains their ultimate health and happiness. Thank you, Mr. Gladwell for the heaping mouthful of food for thought.",4
"Well researched, well read, great perspective.. Couldn't be more pleased with this book. The topics are all fascinating, and you end up learning far more about the factors which determine success than you knew existed. Malcolm presents the information in a way that's easy to digest in audiobook form. Considering listening to it again...",5
"ITEM MISSING - EMPTY PACKAGE. My package came completely empty! There was nothing in the package. The package was sealed and undamaged when I got it. Upon opening it, the package was empty. Nothing was inside not even a piece of paper.",1
"Outliers Book. This book is okay. It's about people who started out with nothing and ended up making a name for themselves. It starts SLOW and stays SLOW throughout. It's written well in the sense of telling peoples lifes stories, but it doesn't pick up speed. It goes from person-to-person-to-person in the same monatone. Almost like putting together a puzzle. Very SLOW written storyline.",3
"fun. Interesting, fun read",4
Good buy from AMAZON !. Good buy from AMAZON !,4
Great. Very interesting. Can't wait to share it with my teenager and hear it again.,5
"Highly Recommended - a definite read!. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  recently read your book Outliers for an assignment for my senior English class and found it very applicable to my class's essential question. The essential question varies depending on what grade the students are in and basically serves as the central theme for the entire course. This year, my class's essential question is, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" I have to admit that I did not really believe that our essential question had very much depth to it this year; I assumed that the answer was plain and simple. However, upon reading your book Outliers, I came to realize exactly how much time and place can affect a person. rom my understanding, the point that you set out to make in this book was that success is not inherent and that any one person's success can be traced back to a variety of factors. In order to prove this point, you take the reader through a variety of stories such as those of Mort Janklow, Chris Langan, and even Asian math students. In all of these stories, the importance of time and place stood out to me. For Mort Janklow, time was imperative to his success because it allowed him to find a job. In the cases of Chris Langan and Asian math students, it seemed that location was more important to their success than time was. While family environment influenced Chris, and cultural environment influenced Asian math students, it is obvious that their locations were determining factors in their successfulness. CONT. IN SEPARATE REVIEW)",4
Five Stars. Yeah good,5
"Always interesting, but not a revalation. Good read, but not the breakthrough like 'Tipping Point' or 'Blink'. In the end, good anecdotes that will be fodder for dinner discussion, but not a cohesive theme or conclusion.",3
Great insight. Definitely worthwhile. The book explores the underlying reasons that some people are able to become great successes. Everything from Bill Gates to the impact of summer vacation on poor students. This is my favorite book of '12.,5
One of the best books on Audible. Lots of fun to listen to and really makes you think.,5
Great book written by a great author. The book provides a detailed review of success and the lives of many successful people in modern history. It is an eye opening book. You enjoy ready this extremely well-written book and you learn a lot too.,5
"Fun. Come on... It's great. Book Candy and sometimes a hoot. Sometime a ""?"""" but always Gladwell. Love it. More please!",4
"Fantastic,Mind-blowing, Unbelievable.... One of the great books that i had come over..Gives u an immense satisfaction and confidence once you are through it..Expecially some of the chapters like 10,000 hr rule..this was simply remarkable..",5
"most excellent. awesome read with brilliant conclusions! this put serendipity into perspective, providence by design and good fortune as an act of a benevolent God!",5
"This book is easy to read and still very informative. This book is easy to read and still very informative. The ideas in here are not entirely new to me because as a teacher of gifted kids, I'd read Terman and already come to a disagreement with his research, but I certainly never thought about most of the ideas presented. I'm thinking I'd never again allow my children to be advances in school again. I think it disadvantages them in may ways. I'd rather keep them with their age mates and give them the advantage of being larger and more capable than the others.",5
Loved it!. Will definitely recommend it! It started off a bit slow for me personally but the further into the book you go the more it gets into you. So I loved it!,5
Great content. Amazing book,5
"This is a very well written and interesting read.. Gladwell has a very accessible writing style and these theories are presented in a very interesting and thought-provoking way. I absolutely loved the book - for non-fiction, it has a great hook and I couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend it.",5

He is a master story teller as evidence by his own personal experiences. I took note on how success can be defined from the lens of factors outside of ourselves.,4
so insightful. Gladwell shares story after story from history that disprove some of our most dearly held beliefs about success. A truly riveting work.,5
"Extraordinary and very very good. The book may or may not be so original for the experts on the subject, but to me, it was extremely original, interesting, thought provoking, fun to read and revealing. I am a rather successful person myself who tries to understand the routes to success so that I can maybe try to lead my three children accordingly. Towards that end I found the book very very useful. Having read all his other books, I think Gladwell is a pathbraker. Congratulations. Thoroughly enjoyed every single page.",5
"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",5
Very interesting book. Excellent Book!,5
"interesting and informative....but.... Great premise. Very interesting and thought provoking. I did not enjoy the last half of the book however. I feel he stated his case very well in the first half but there were no new ideas presented in the 2nd half. My advice is to get the book and read the first half and stop when you get bored. On the strength of this book, I would be interested in checking out (pardon the pun) his other books..",4
Wow thats why people are succesful.. Was guided to this book by one of my sons rugby coaches. Well worth the read. Even if you haven't got a son/daughter who is talented and are getting frustrated by their lack of application this book is worth reading. Ever wondered why people are succesful well here is the answer.,5
"My 16 year old loves it!. My daughter needed this book for her AP English language class in school. However, she has read it several times, and told me how much she enjoys the book. Win/win!",5
"kinda boring. high expectation for this book, but after reading half the book, i stopped. I felt like things were jumping around and many things are already obvious to me",3
Good book. Very interesting book with nice insights that were well documented and researched. also nice and clear to listen to,5
Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,2
Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,5
A Very Iteresting read. This was probably my most interesting reads for the whole,5
Great book. A good listen. He definitely puts our ideologies to the test and explains his theory and follows it up with interesting facts to back it up.,5
Surprising and Astounding. Loved it. It gives analysis on the factors associated with success. This was my first audiobook,5
"Good read though, I wasn't bored..... Liked this a lot, but then I'm a chronic underachiever so I probably would.",4
Outlier was not what I expected.. Disappointed:( this book was a to read for me so long but the ended up not being what I expected.,2
Five Stars. So interesting! A must read.,5
"This book is an outlier.. This is one of my favorites in my personal library. I especially love the ""10,000 hour rule"" in the book which suggests that no matter your level of talent or genius it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become world-class in your discipline or skill. He explains why even geniuses like Mozart were not exempt from this rule. The title does not over-promise but it delivers in content.",5
"This book should be required reading in high school. Although the theme prevalent in this book may seem very familiar to some successful people, it is a good guide for those who think that all you need are good connections and a lot of luck. This book should be required reading in High school.",4
"Different perspective on personal success. My favorite parts here in this book are dedicated to educational systems and parenting, and what can be done about fixing the current state of things, so that more people could become successful at what they are doing academically.",5
Awesome Read. A thought provoking and inspiring book...very insightful with good examples and scenarios. Easy to follow narration.,5

The book brought out for me simple and very practical truths that are easy or perhaps convenient to ignore - peoples' backgrounds that truly and more accurately complete their stories of success. Thank you Malcolm!,5
"Success and luck. Now we hear the rest of the story. A well written discussion of why some people with all of the right background, intelligence, and social status make big impacts while others don't. Spoiler: there is an element of being in the right place at the right time.",5
Five Stars. Great book!,5
"Highly remmended read. This is a read for every person who may wonder why some people lead ""charmed""lives and most of us don't. It explains in well written and easy to read detail that is the hard work, opportunities seized, and belief in the unknown future that makes greatness, if not in ourselves, then in our children. A must read for all those who don't understand the wisdom of hard work being it's own reward, not handing things to people and expecting the same appreciation.",5
Gifted. Sent as a gift,5
Five Stars. Love everything Malcolm Gladwell,5
Five Stars. Great book!,5
"life changer. great, a little heartbreaking at first because it's shows the REAL side of what before appears to be something like a miracle",5
"Opportunity + Work = Success. Makes the case that every outlier got there by a set of circumstances. It's like saying, the spire on top of a building got there by a set of preconditions. You don't have many high-rises in the desert (except Dubai), and you don't have many bob-sled champions coming out of Jamaica.",5
great story. very intriguing insight into talent. I am so glad I read this book. I have heard so many things about it and it is definitely worth it. I recommend this book to anyone it is serious loaded with great content!,5
"Bootstrappers. Great narration of how opportunities through policies, economic or social status, or marked periods in time provide insight of success.",5
"The secret about Ouliers!. I'm so glad I finally finished this book, I actually stopped reading it for about a week because I thought some of the explanations were BS until everything started to come together in the last 2 chapter's! Good save and i loved his personal story being shared. Outliers are not created as much as they are cultivated for greatness.",5
Will We Change Our Ways?. Malcolm Gladwell shows an number of ways we can improve the way we educate. We can easily increase the number of gifted students. Will we? He also shows how to eliminate the education gap between privileged students and under privileged students. Will we? Or will we just sit by and go with the status quo?,4
I found this book to be so interesting that I .... I found this book to be so interesting that I couldn’t put it down! I will be ordering another one of his books soon.,5
Great read for an athlete. Very well written book to give any athlete.,5
got it for my daughter no complants. got it for my daughter no complants,5
Great book great price.. Great book great price. Love Malcolm Gladwell's books. This one doesn't disappoint.,5
"Another life-changing work by Gladwell. Many of the outliers discussed in his narratives are just the people I, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur feeling defeated by time, have scrutinized I search of an explanation. Reading their biographies, the explanation is right there. Being shaped myself but our individualistic Western culture I was blind to the answers before me until Gladwell happily shown a light on the truest explanation. Of course these are great people with a lot of talent and potential and good work ethic, but that's only a sliver of the explanation. It's also inspiring to realize that I'm faced daily with opportunities to become an outlier. I just have to keep an open mind.",5
my review. I haven't finished yet but this piece of shit wouldn't let me read with out review boom boom boom boom,3
"Very interesting. It just goes to show that to master your field that education, talent, intelligence, and luck all factor in. However, hard work brings it all together. A 10,000 hour commitment, are you willing to put in the work? How bad do you want it?",5
"excellent book about success. The book Outliers describes how success is made through hard work, having the right family ethic, and total luck. This book somewhat dispels the idea that success can only be attained by those who are innately gifted. This book definitely contrasts itself from the popular belief of what success is.",5
"Best of His Work so Far. This was easily the best of Gladwell's work so far. It really gets at the concepts of what helps people succeed. And, to a large extent, success is not something one is born with. A person shapes their future and their success through a mix of talent and lots of hard work. As an educator, I quote this book heavily with both staff and students.",5
"Observations On Icons Of Success In History. Book is very entertaining as well as interesting. Has some great history and examples of monumental successes and goes into detail on the circumstances surrounding those successes. Author has some very unique observational view points that are ammusing to say the least. Agree with the authors points or not his books are very thought provoking I think everyone would agree, even those who don't like the book for whatever reason.",5
"Good read. Informative. Helps you see that where you live, who you know, how you were raised, and the community resources all help in developing next great minds and success stories. Read and grow.",5
Interesting Points But Overly Broad Assertions & Racist Postulations. I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.,3
"An informative, entertaining, yet droning novel. From the moment I began reading, I knew what I was in for. A book that spells out it's message in the title, while containing descriptive elaboration. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, in fact, there are a handful of sections that are truly fascinating. It just doesn't know where to go sometimes.",4
A Recommended Read for Teachers. Provides multiple examples for teachers and those who train teachers regarding the unique and critical factors that contribute to success in any era.,5
Outliers. Love Malcolm Gladwell! This book arrived quickly and as described.,5
"Thought provoking statistics.. Interesting information for all - parents, educators et al",4
It's okay. It has good moments.,4
Great. This book can be boring but it is s great book,5
Great Book!. I love the way that he looks into people's backgrounds and stories. There are so many details that play into who we are than we think.,5
"highly recommend it.<br />. if you have children this book will be even more impactful, I find myself thinking back on how I can apply what I've learned to parenting and life in general.",5
One of my favorite books hands down. this book is a classic and beautifully written.,5
"Inspiring. I enjoyed this book tremendously and have learned a lot about life and work , my own heart and diligence. If you want to succeed in any area this book will help.",5
"Outliers. good read, good inspiration to be grateful for the opps that come your way, interesting analysis of how some have overcome adversity",4
100% worth the buy! Read this book as soon .... 100% worth the buy! Read this book as soon as possible. Ideally you should have read before entering high school.,5
"Average book. It's not average in terms of other books, but I've read much better from Gladwell. Would recommend nonetheless based on merit of ideas",3
"eye opening. you will never look at the successful people the same. Same respect, but deeper understanding.",5
"Perfect for High School English class. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In our Senior English class, the essential question we are analyzing is, ""To what extent does time and place define a person?"" We have been basing topics and ideas to revolve around this question and analyzing how it does define a person. Therefore, we read your novel, Outliers in which you explain how these factors impact one's success or one's failures through descriptive stories about real life people. Most of the examples portray how time and place can provide opportunities that can lead to a successful life, allowing them to become an ""outlier"". But I believed that three chapters stood out from the rest that seemed the most interesting. In the chapter, ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"", the fact that most professionals had practiced at least a total of 10,000 hours on their talent was fascinating. Practicing a total of 10,000 hours seemed to be the common theme in this chapter because all of the skilled people had that or more while the lesser lacked the same amount of practice. I also agree with this logic because it seems that many people may start out with a bit more of an advantage, but the dedication to strive to become better ultimately separates the skilled from the unskilled. I was also curious to know if there have been any exceptions to this rule, such as a professional pianist who has only had 7,000 hours of practice, but performs just as well as someone with 10,000 hours. Another chapter that was interesting was, ""The Trouble with Geniuses Part II"", which included two different geniuses that had opposite lives because of a skill required through one's environment called practical intelligence. You would expect any genius to master that skill, no matter the cause, but it was Oppenheimer who used this skill to manipulate a situation, while Langan could not. Also, I agree with the results of the study about the lives of wealthier families and poorer families and how it impacts their practical intelligence, because the wealthier parents seem to allow their children to be more independent. After reading Oppenheimer's story, I was curious to know what he said that was so persuasive that allowed him to be excused from jail. Lastly, the chapter, ""Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", was another interesting section about how time really presents opportunities. Flom's cases at the time were considered minor until businesses seized to control one another, which made his cases extremely important and current. Time seems to be the gateway that allowed Flom to become successful. I agree with your logic that some disadvantages could be one's opportunities for success, which is portrayed through the life of Joe Flom. Although, I do wonder if there are many others like Flom because his scenario seems rare. Furthermore, I also enjoyed reading the chapter, ""Rice Paddies and Math Test"", since it related to my own life. I've always viewed my math skills as excellent solely because I was Chinese, but now I understand that many factors contribute to this talent, such as the work ethic of my people. But, although I am Chinese, I do not use the Chinese language so the words are not quicker, which still does not allow me to understand why I am more advanced than others at this subject. Overall, I loved the way you described these situations and how they correlate with our essential question. Sincerely, David Dang",5
"Excellent material for teachers and prospective parents. Gives a very well thought-out perspective on how a person can become successful (in the common meaning). This could also be called ""The Roots Of Exceptional Success""",5
Very interesting concept. First couple of chapters are critical to understand the concept and the idea behind. Then is comes too descriptive in my view. Last three chapters were those I enjoyed the most. The book definitely arise some questions and debate. Very worth “reading”,4
"Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along",1
"enthralling. changed my outlook on the world completely, i read this around four years ago, but finally decided to reread it, but yes it still has impact",5
Worthless. First 10 pages crushed. Seems like an old discarded product. Disappointed.,1
Thoughts. a little stressful..Exploited all that I have not done and need to do to ensure mu children's success,4
It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) .... Fascinating facts and examples capture the reader's attention but some of the author's opnions are not totally applaudable. It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) and right birthday... all these have to be right in order to be successful.,4
"What Lies Beneath. Gladwell does a great job of ""looking beneath the surface"" to find the real reason that certain things happen. That statement is too general but in a nutshell, Outliers is worth a read if you want to open up your point of view and ability to look at the world around you through a new perspective. Most of the stories / examples are very entertaining.",4
"A young person's guide for Success. An interesting variety of short stories about many successful people's lives from which young people, who are serious about being great, can gain insight and purpose.",5
Keeps You Intrigued From Start to End. This book gives great insight into the world of individuals who have become titans of our society. Gladwell does a wonderful job of intertwining side stories with the major plot of the novel. It was awesome to see the diverse group of people he described from Bill Gates to Marita the KLIPP Academy student and how their paths have lead them to success. Work hard and the world will reward you.,5
Five Stars. Good product. Great book.,5
Full of information on Famous people. I read this in three days while I waited for my wife to get read in the morning. The stories are very succinct and packed with information I would never have even thought about. I never knew anything about Bill Gates other that he started Microsoft with Paul Allen.,5
"Thought Provoking. You go through a flurry of thought, emotions, skepticism, doubt, disappointment, hope. and a greater understanding of how the world works.",5
A well written work that illuminates the importance of taking .... A well written work that illuminates the importance of taking the initiative to seek out opportunities no matter our circumstances. Another refreshing and inspiring Gladwell to pass on to others!,5
"A must. Love Malcom Gladwell books , very easy to read",5
"A little dry in some places, but overall very interesting! A di. A little dry in some places, but overall very interesting! A different perspective to be considered!",4
"Simply a terrible book. The reasoning in this book was very thin. Gladwell takes a few anecdotal examples and builds a tremendously over-simplified theory of success. For example, he pontificates that the Beatles were successful because they had played long hours in a Homburg club, as if that were the only factor to their success. I found the book cloying and I really sorry I wasted my money on it.",1
"Great book. Great book, gives people the knowledge of success",5
Must read. Excellent book. It changes the popular myth that success is reserved for magically talented people.,5
"Relatively entertaining.... A few insights here & there, but overall too simplistic. Clearly written to be a best seller, if you know what I mean.",5
"A good book to share with the whole family. Being a successful professional, I learned a lot from this book. The author writes well to make serious topics fun to read.",5
"Superb. Ignore the negative reviews, this is pure genius.",5
Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,2
CD had issues playing. The book it self was interesting until the second half. It got a bit repetitive and what seemed off topic.,2
"Interesting. Had to read this for school, honestly I was not at all excited to read this book. But after starting, overall it’s actually pretty good and interesting, I found I read my way through pretty quickly, it had its slow moments/less interesting but overall a pretty decent book.",4
The Best. One if the best books I have ever heard. If you like the psychology and social economic story's of success you will love this book.,5
5 star. Read it before. Highly recommend it to anyone. Bought copies for several friends.,5
Five Stars. I Like his unique views,5
"Recommended from many, well worth the time. If you are looking for a very interesting perspective on so called ""success"" then this book is for you. Through a series of examples Gladwell really gets down to the nuts and bolts of how many people become successful. The ideas presented, while basic in nature, may have an impact.",5
The book outlines the things needed for success. Great book. Gives a completely new perspective on successful people.,4
Fascinating book !!. This book will change your thinking about intelligence. Gladwell's message is - intelligence comes from a lot of hard work and well-times opportunity.,5
"Makes you really think---very good book. I really enjoyed this very interesting book. I read it and listened to it (from my library audio app) at the same time. Fascinating research on how circumstances, opportunities, family and culture affect the success of a person. Loved the chapter on the airplane pilots and their cultural differences, loved the chapters on opportunities to ""practice"" something 10,000 times....just a very readable, interesting book. I highly recommend it. Loved his ending chapter about his own family culture and how they were shaped by opportunity, etc.",5
"Helps to understad ""Outliers"". it is a great book, and helps us to build our ability to think about ""Outliers"". Though I read Tipping points by Gladwell, I really think Outlier wins. Malcom had done phenomenal job explaining the events and comparisons. Must read.",5
"Good read. This book has an interesting premise (that extreme success is not as random as it might first appear), and develops well.",5
"Great Book!. I would recommend this book to parents, students, professionals &amp; kids in middle school as well. It is an amazing book, which emphasizes the importance of hard work &amp; passion for any goal. The only part which I disagreed with, was relation between Math &amp; Chinese methodology for counting, as reason for why Asians excel in math. Asians are good in math agreed, but if you look at Indian methodology for counting, it is no different from Western. History shows lots of great Western Mathematicians to support my point. More research was needed for that chapter.",5
Five Stars. I was very satisfied with the book.,5
Good. Great book to read,5
Very enjoyable educational read. Very enjoyable approach to an intelligent evaluation of the variables in any system.,5
"Very thought provoking. Absolutely loved Outliers! Very well written and with so many fascinating points. I want to read it again to make sure I picked them all up! (Be aware that this is not a quick and easy read; it requires your full attention and time, but it's so incredibly rewarding and fulfilling!)",5
Amazing Book. one of the best books i had,5
Five Stars. #1,5
insightful and stimulating. I find this book extremely insightful and revelatory in many ways. Love all the research and fact finding. Really insides the reader to look at life through a different set of lenses...,5
"Insightful and engaging. One of few books that i cant stop once i started ! great for parents to be, social policy makers and reflection generally",5
"Compelling and fascinating. Malcolm Gladwell is a gifted journalist and writer, and Outliers was both a fascinating and compelling look (or rather, assault) on how we view success. He’s got a great voice for podcasts/ audio books, and was enjoyable to listen to him read his book. Couldn’t put down!",5
Loved it. This book was fantastic!,5
Interest overview of successful people. I love Malcolm Gladwell way of putting basic concepts and aspects of life in a very interesting and different perspective,5
Things That Matter. This is an eye opening study of how things really happen and why.,5
"Amazing book. Fascinating study of history as it effects individual and cultural future. I often had trouble pausing the book to go do things I knew I needed to do, it held my attention that well.",5
An inspired analysis of success. This book should be read by everyone regardless of there status or success. it allows all to see the path to a more successful life for themselves and the people they guide,5
Read this book!. This guy is awesome; the way he articulates his observations and backs it up with evidence makes for a wonderful read.,5
Four Stars. Great narrative style with interesting examples to drive point home,4
"Outlier is a Standout in and of Itself. Throw out any other self-help book and substitute it with this. As meticulous and fact-based Gladwell’s work is, it is all too inspiring to learn what the true formula for success is. Well-written and pleasantly read, this was a great book to listen to all the way to the very end.",5
"Read this when your children are very young. A book of ""things it is good to know"" when raising children and understanding success. Another outstanding Gladwell analysis that makes so much sense. Two important thing I will keep handy is: the importance of perseverance (how do you get to Carnagie Hall) and teach children to do math like the Chinese!",5
"Great book. Easy to read. Frankly, it is one of the best book that I read.. Great book. Easy to read. Frankly, it is one of the best book that I read. I saw video clip in which an interviewer asks Bill Gates about this book and his answer sound like a critic toward main ideas of the book. Now I understand that I wrongly understood the clip, Bill Gate didn't criticized the book he approved its ideas.",5
"I didn't like this one nearly as much. I picked this up after reading Malcom Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point"". I didn't like this one nearly as much, but it was definitely still interestig. I couldn't put it down at points. I eneded up giving it to my buddy to read and he had good things to say about it too.",4
"Influential!. The second most influential book I've been exposed to, behind the bible.",5
"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself. In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount. One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself. Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately. I agree with the premise of the book to a point. While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors. By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",5
More than Horatio Algerish. This is a really good book.,5
It was very interesting. I liked how the author related back to himself at the very end. Very well written and I enjoyed reading it.,2
"and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I .... This book has fundamentally altered the course of my existence. I will remember this book and reference it whenever I can. I was forced to read it for class, and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I have read in my entire life this book has been the most inspiring. Many of the things in here are common sense. It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few. Greatness is in fact the reward of those who work hard. I read this book at exactly the right time in my life and would suggest it to anyone. I am an avid reader, but I have never enjoyed books presented to me in school until this book!",5
"Insightful and a change of perspective. Very well laid out book, granted it is largely anecdotal but allows for a different perspective. Most of these concepts are common sense; however, they are presented in a new way to make you understand better.",4
Four Stars. given as a gift and was well appreciated,4
"One of the I've read!. If success, opportunity, and privilege are themes that interest you, this book is for you. With entire chapters devoted to education, I encourage any teacher (especially math teachers) to pick this up and read it. I could not put it down. Highly recommend, it will change the way you see the world (and the way you see success)!",5
"Provides an Ah-hah Moment. This is a great explanation about things we've often wondered about related to success. No, it doesn't just ""happen"" or does it? This book provides poignant examples of the preparation it takes to meet opportunity and the other stuff that works for us (or against us) in the pursuit of the every elusive ""success"" as defined by this culture. Gladwell gives substantive back up to his propositions, forcing the reader to give his conclusions validity and credence. Great read!",5
"Intriguing Insight. Captivating scenarios- obviously immaculately researched. While time invested is a commanding observation, Forrest Gump may have summarized all with chocolate.",3
Four Stars. Great book!,4
"Great read. I enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's ability to stitch together a unique perspective in a super readable narrative. Further, he creates a space in which this reader begins to see his arguments throughout history, personal or otherwise, and in real time.",5
"An excellent misinterpretation of reality. Gladwell is an excellent researcher, phenomenal writer, and a fantastic reader perfectly suited for Audible. I’m grateful for every chapter of this book. His premise, privilege of race and opportunity are the destroyers of a belief in rugged individualism is debunked by his own research into those who’s drive to succeed lead them to prepare, to take any advantage they could find, and never to quit in a country that rewards those who do such. Gladwell’s remarkable research also proves that parents are the greatest influence in a child’s success or lack thereof. Parents instill work ethic, feed or starve emotional intelligence, and elevate or lower their children’s view of their own potential in the world. His assertion that uncontrollable forces such as time of birth and family of birth only reinforce the truth that parents should consider their role sacred.",4
Five Stars. COMMON SENSE,5
Perspective changing. Easy to listen to and entertaining. This was my first audio book. I love listening to music on my way to and from work; this was a wonderful alternative.,5
Get this.. I really enjoyed listening to Malcolm Gladwell. He is a hell of a story teller. I recommend this audiobook.,5
From the quality of the paperbook it is easy to tell that it is a duplicate book.. It looked like a duplicate book. You can easily tell the book is duplicate from the quality of the paper book. I picked a copy from barnes and nobles.,1
Inspiring book. Very very good read. I just didnt like the quality of the book. Im just fussy lol,3
"Changed my perspective. Outliers made me rethink my perspective of how people become successful in whatever they do. I started reading it as a business book, but it turned out to be so much more. It's a ""must read""!",5
Interesting and enjoyable. I really enjoyed this book . I think it helped more than most leadership books I have read.,5
"I love this author and have read multiple books by him. I love this author and have read multiple books by him. He is great at explaining the information in an easy to understand manner. I read it a year ago and still remember interesting facts and topics taught. This book deserves a good two reads to fully understand and grasp all the information given. Recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about success. Also, my sister who doesn't read very often and doesn't enjoy nonfiction reads loved this book!",5
"A Different View of Success. I first heard about this book when Chris Rock referred to it on The Howard Stern Show. When Stern asked Rock what it took to be a great standup comic Rock replied, ""ten thousand mother f***ing hours."" Stern got the reference right away, saying ""Malcolm Gladwell right?"" and Chris Rock said, ""it's my bible."" I downloaded this to my kindle before the interview was over.",4
"Shhh don't tell anyone!. The secrets successful people don’t want you to know. This was fun to read, interesting. If you are planning on raising a family, you should read this book (it might change the lives of your children). Some very good facts and statistics, explained well. If they would teach this in school, society might not be filled with so much dogma and inequity.",5
Love it. Wonderful book!. Very complete and full of info. Can't beat it!,5
"Seize your opportunities when they come!. Work hard on your unique abilities, for long enough, & you will ""luckily"" be presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you will be ready to capitalize on!!",5
Five Stars. Very Interest and thought provoking!,5
"Simply the Best. This is simply the best and most insightful book of its type that I have read or listened to. It has profound implications, especially the section on education. The interview with the author after the book is equally interesting and worthwhile. Read it, listen to it, think about it.",5
"""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",5
Great Book.. Loved it. Thought provoking. Forces you to look at things differently and makes you a bit more humbleabout tourown success.,5
Three years of thought after reading this book. I have to come back and review this book after reading it a few years ago.,5
Deep Analytical Wordly. The Narrator was great clear thoughts though some times far out my favorite part is the Authir speaking about his Jamaican Heritage this book investigates the path to success from a scientific stance,5
"Great read.. This was an interesting book, that grabbed me from the first line. Gladwell provides logical reasoning and sense behind his ""theory / arguments"". Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting. What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way. Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",5
"very interesting. A look behind the curtain of what helps to make some of the most successful people successful. This is not a book that tells you how to become successful, but instead looks at the reasons people became successful. some very interesting theories",4
Very eye opening. Very good,4
"My dad recommended this guy. Almost sad at times, it completely dismantles the sentiment that success happens in a vacuum. Speaks at depth, without ever being boring or overly complex. Great read",5
Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,4
a great. Very interesting book.....a great read,5
"Odd but good. Never had I experienced a book and wonder where the point of the story becomes clear. Yet, I read the entire book and enjoyed the author's view by looking at people and patterns that influence their success/failure. I'm 50, and keep trying to look at the world differently. This helps me keep up with our fast changing world. A nice read for someone that rarely finishes a book. Recommended.",4
"Good read, but does not challenge the foundations. Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.",3
Very interestings concepts. The ideas were very new and thought provoking. Some were logical and some were a surprise.,4
Outliers. I liked the first chapter and then it all became a bit repetitive. I enjoyed the author's writing style and compliment him on his research.,3
Fun read.. This was the first of Gladwell's books that I read.,4
"Will Smith brought me here. I initially read this book because of Will Smith. This book started off rough for me because I felt bombarding by stats. I soon began to see that Gladwell was proven his theory. Although, I found the research amazing and valuable I wasn't sure what (I) should do with it. Until the very end where he brings it all full circle and that's my only criticism. I wish the utility of the information given was stated sooner. Still a great book.",5
great!. A different perspective I didn't give enough thought ...loved this book will definitely reread And reread,5
"Hard work and emotional intelligence. I've always been curious about the archetypal ""overachieving"" type; the person with a 4.0 GPA, supplemented with a vast resume of extracurriculars and seemingly guaranteed placement at some selective, elite institution. They seem to effortlessly master their studies, creating a very bothersome imposition in the back of my mind that made me feel inadequate. For awhile, I felt that there was something innate these certain individuals possessed, hardening my fatalistic perspective about the world and making me question my own self-worth. ladwell essentially put everything into perspective for me. People aren't just born ""with it."" The typical stories describing the ascent to success by prominent individuals oftentimes, if not always, obscure the social, cultural, economic, institutional and fortuitous elements that allow that person to rise in the first place. This book, replete with credible substantiations, investigates the lives of many successful people, like Bill Gates and Joe Flom, and show how particular environmental factors and fortunate circumstances led to the realization of these individuals' potential. The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches."" This book comprehensively examines not just individuals, but systems (like public education), and stereotypes (such as Asians being good at math) to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of what provides the proper foundation for high achievement. hough, let me be clear: this book does *NOT* suggest that sheer hard work is somehow irrelevant, or weakly relevant (i.e. ""it's all luck""), in one's pursuit of success. To the contrary, this book emphatically illustrates how crucial hard work is to the fulfillment of success. The book, however, indicates that hard work goes hand-in-hand with opportunity. Your intellectual potential might have you be a great computer programmer, mathematician, or businessman. Unfortunately, it might very well go to waste without the resources needed to foster the development of such potential. There's no point in having a warehouse of hardy seeds without the fertile soil to plant them in. his book has inspired me to push onward with my studies, to work incredibly hard towards mastery of subject material and to seek opportunity and claim it upon arrival. Highly recommended book! nother on the subject I tore through recently and recommend strongly in addition to Gladwell's book, because it's great and it includes an online test of your emotional intelligence is, Emotional Intelligence 2.0.",5
Excellent.. Great book! a definite must read to understand the nature of success and the application of these ideas to our lives.,5
"Book Great - Amazon's vendor disappointed me. Malcolm Gladwell is a most intelligent writer who presents his thoughts, opinions and factual results of various events and research for reaching the conclusions he presents in this and his other books.",5
"but thoroughly enjoyed this book. Get this book. Not a big reader, but thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great structure as each chapter goes into detail of a specific outlier. First book of Malcolm Gladwell I read and will definitely get another soon.",5
"Not ""Very Good"" condition. This is a great book and Malcolm Gladwell is fantastic, but this copy of the book was in poor condition despite being sold as ""very good"".",2
Analytical. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in behavioral economics or redefining the road to success,5
"Great concepts. Truly enjoyed this book, nice stories/examples from variety of cultures. Interesting theory on how successful people are actually have been made, and it will make you rethink how many factors are actually involved in “making it”. Timing/ethnicity/cultural environment etc. are detrimental to success, as much as hard work and perseverance.",4
Five Stars. Great book!,5
"Interesting facts and interpretations. I agree that successful people are products of circumstances and effort. However, the author elevates the importance of uncontrollable circumstance above hard work and controlled circumstances. In my experience in life, a lot of people, if not most, choose the path of least resistance. Opportunities are there, but they don't take it. Also, much of the circumstances that we find ourselves are products of our of own choices. The author brings the fact that he, by fortune, became best friends with intelligent people, but that was his choice. He didn't need to continue to be friends. I did enjoy the facts presented and the interpretations. Gave me valuable insight into different social and cultural structures.",3
Malcolm Gladwell did it again! - A Must Read Business Book.. GREAT Book to better understand what makes influential and innovative leaders.,5
"Depressing, not inspiring. While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas. For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.",2
It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set .... This book gets you thinking about what we as a society should consider doing differently to encourage everyone to succeed. It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set themselves and those they care about to succeed.,5
"The perspective outliers gives us is important. Wow, I hadn't realized how something as simple as Birthday or cultural awareness of generations of advantages stack up.",5
"Fascinating. Gladwell argues that the American ideal of independent success against all odds is a myth. Success is the result of a perfect combination of time, place, and culture. People who succeed despite great adversity often have hidden advantages. Some negative societal forces can actually serve as advantages in the right place and time.",5
"Pessimistic Excuses To Demotivate Everyone. The author is basically arguing that all phenomenally successful people are products of the privilege and luck! While there is some validity to his argument, it clearly devalues hard work and effort. It’s so ignorant! It tries to blame culture and community you were brought up in for your successes and failures. It’s so pessimistic and miserable! It’s a waste of time.",1
"Awesome Reading stuff. This book is highly inspirational. Not just written in good style, but its a collection of well researched material, explained in a simple language. It makes me look back and start evaluating who I'm in the context of where I came from and what was the environment like from which I grew up. I'll definitely recommend it to parents, friends, teachers, faith leaders and my friends, sons and daughters. Big Ups!!",5
"Couldn't put it down!. Very interesting, meticulous research. Ended with some personal family history, which I loved. My only criticism is that it seemed to end abruptly. i don't know if it was because I was enjoying it so much or it was a crash landing (pun intended). I highly recommend it and have been quoting from it since I read it.",5
Five Stars. OK book,5
"Brilliant. Very thought provoking, and so compulsory for the mans' mind!",5
Five Stars. Very good condition thank you,5
Outliers. Thought it was good. Made me think about my own life and certain advantages I have had. Definitely recommend this book.,4
"Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatl. If you've ever heard people say, ""You gotta put in 10,000 hours into something before you're an expert."" Chances are they read Outliers. Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatles. The stories and the social science behind them is fascinating and Gladwell's prose makes it an easy, liquid-like read. For people who like to think and want to know how things work, this book is for you.",5
"Are you inside or Outside. This is excellent reading and a must for anyone with aspirations of glory. If you believe that things happen by luck or simply hard work, think again. Read this book to get it straight.",5
"Interesting Stories. Gladwell does a great a job in most chapters, but a couple are not relevant.",5
"Looking to get to the next level? Read this book!. The book, ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell teaches readers the fundamentals of recognizing opportunities and taking advantage of them. The many examples provided in the book offers a blueprint in the shaping of one's own destiny. One of the most important tenets of the book was that autonomy, complexity and a connection between effort and reward is the portal through which people become successful.",5
An impeccable work from an outlier. A great book I will always love to read over again. Malcolm Gladwell did a whole lot of research in putting together this lovely book.,5
"I could not finish this book. Oh wait, I couldn't even get start. I could not finish this book. Oh wait, I couldn't even get started.",2
Ayn Rand should read this book.. There is no god-child. Equality of opportunity is essential for her philosophy to maximizes both its and our potential. Purple monkey dishwasher.,5
"Not What I Expected. Although a few of the stories were interesting, I was lead to believe there were more interesting life stories told.",2
"Wonderful interesting quick read. Outliers is filled with interesting facts and figures. This book will keep you reading long after you thought you would stop for the day. You don't often hear the word ""fun"" associated with a book but this was fun to read.",5
"Excellent book about the background of success.. This book was extremely interesting. Every page held my interests and it was so great to read a perspective on success that isn't all about self promotion and ""doing it all your own"". A very good read indeed!",5
Great book!. What a great book! Really takes a deep look into the preconceived ideas of super special and extraordinary people.,5
"Another Must-Read. We observe human outliers on a daily basis whether we are watching the exceptional athletes competing in the NBA or Stanley Cup Finals, reading about the latest billion dollar company, admiring a sketch by M.C. Escher, or listening to the works of Mozart or Bach.",5
Excellent read. Great book!,5
Insightful. Puts personal history in a different light. Reading this book made me appreciate all the outliers in my own life that brought me where I am today as a successful physician.,5
"Excellent. Brilliant book and a must read for everyone, especially parents. There are excellent learning points around providing your children with the right environment to achieve their potential, creating opportunity etc.",5
"Insightful. Great book, very insightful. Gives you a very honest look into how the greats become ""great"" which is not discussed in many other books.",5
"A marvel to read. A marvelous read, Malcolm Gladwell once again breaks down what seems to be a complicated topic into what anyone can understand",5
"Very good. Well written about a fascinating view of ""outliers"". Very good. Well written about a fascinating view of ""outliers"".",5
Great Read!. The book is great and contains a wide plethora of interesting stories and concepts. I enjoyed reading it. It truly placed some common notions under scrutiny and challenged the assumption that high IQ equals success. This is a must-read for any Malcolm Gladwell fans or for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the world around them.,5
"Fun and thought provoking. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, this is another must read. It's interesting and makes sense. I wonder, why don't we do what he is suggesting about how we measure genius, intelligence and luck?",5
"Long and Drain Out, but Motivating. Long and Drain Out, but Motivating. Really helps you to understand the power of consistency",4
"Great Book. The Beatles. Bill Gates. Chinese rice farmers. Such a motley crew. Who would imagine that they have so much in common. This book had me from the get go just like a good novel would. Authors reading their own work is risky business but Malcolm Gladwell ROCKS it. He knows his material so eel - and it's so interesting - l that it feels like he's telling a good story rather than reading nonfiction. And he's as good a narrator as any - great inflection, perfect pace, fabulous content. Who could ask for more?!  This book opened my eyes in wonderful ways to what it takes to be successful. And his insights into the real problems with our educational system, was worth the entire book. If you are reading this, GET THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.",5
Success Redefined!. Wow! Great read. Highly recommend this book! Get it on Audible as listen now! xoxo,5
"learned a couple good things to know. Was a good read. author makes / popularizes some unexpected connections about life and work. he rambles & repeats himself at the end of some of the chapters, just skim these parts and jump to the next chapter.",4
great read!. This book really makes you view the successful in a much different way. A Very entertaining and thought provoking read.,5
A Must read for anyone and everyone who is on a journey of self development. Loved every word,5
Must read. Great book,5
I read it for school. I hated it,1
"Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am .... Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am certainly thinking a lot more now, and appreciate his perspectives. ""Freakonomics"" for real life......",5
"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",4
"Great book, with many surprises and concepts that I can use. This is very fun to read with several surprises about how the super exceptional often happens. I learned a lot, and much can be applied in helpful ways.",5
"💋💋💋💋💋. Oh my goodness i gave this book 5/5 kisses! It was an awesome book. It talks about how successful people are rarely successful on their own. Their was an advantage somewhere that they usually don’t mention. Even though persistence and hardwork is a major factor, if more people had some of the same opportunities then maybe their would be more successful people. I love how he talks about his advantages and his families advantages at the end of the book. I couldnt put the book down.",5
"Malcolm Gladwell's Book,Outliers. Outliers was such a well crafted Sociological treatise on the questionable assumptions made for future success for determining successful future performance in many fields of endeaver from athletes to musicians, pilots of aircraft and entreprenuers, to name a few. His perceptive studies resulted in an expanded comprehension of the underlying factors of success. His mention of ten thousand hours invested in outstanding success preparation was certainly alofty goal, but total dedication is to be recognized and respected. Enjoyed his work. It was most thought provoking.",5
Five Stars. I've read this book multiple times and recommend it to anyone and everyone.,5
Read this...but don't take 10k hours to do it.... Again Gladwell is a genius,4
"Five Stars. Amazing book with lots of insight, read it!",5
Great read!. Will definitely make you reevaluate your own goals and open your mind up to what your capable of being successful at.,4
Very interesting read. Well thought and some provocative ideas put forward! A detailed historical account of success that makes one pause and reassess success!,5
"Five Stars. An excellent read. Hugely varied examples throughout. ""View the world through a true academics eyes"".",5
Excellent book. This is one of the life-changing books.,5
"Great Book for a Critical Thinking Class. This is an excellent book to read for leisure reading or for a course on critical thinking. I used this book for a class in critical thinking and analyzing. The great thing about this book is the author discusses his theory as to what an ""Outlier"" is with examples and that unto itself, leads to discussions. Whether or not you agree with Gladwell, you will stop to think about what he has said once you have read the book.",5
"Outliers is too entertaining to put down, too provocative to ign. Outliers is too entertaining to put down, too provocative to ignore, and too interesting to bore.  It is the epitome of a great book, exceptionally well-written and beautifully tied together. Outliers is an exquisitely gathered and analyzed mass of information with the personal touch that makes it all coherent, and certainly worth reading. Outliers focuses on the cases of individuals whose achievement is exceptional, who somehow possess an innate talent or ability that allows them to reach high levels of success. Gladwell analyzes the individual stories of Oppenheimer, The Beatles, and Bill Gates among other to illustrate his complex, yet innately uncomplicated theory about society.  His writing challenges assumptions about success and it&amp;rsquo;s origins, and proposes several novel ideas in the field of &amp;ldquo;outliers&amp;rdquo; in society.  This book is definitely worth your time, the definition of a &amp;quot;great read&amp;quot;",5
"Intelligence does not necessarily guarantee success.. This challenged many of my long held beliefs that intelligent people will reach the top of their fields, whether in industry, business or sport. So much of success in life depends on when and where you were born and opportunities offered. I will be quoting from this book often. An excellent read.",5
Wonderful book. I was deeply moved by this book and have purchased this copy for my grandchildren.,5
"Thought provoking. Very interesting read on how people benefit from circumstances in their environment. As a parent, it has made me think about what advantages I may be able to help create for my own children.",4
Five Stars. Great,5
"I adore malcom gladwell... I love the fact that Malcolm gladwell narrates his own books, you feel his passion. He has made me fall in love with social psychology, and I an currently practicing everything I've learned from his books.",5
A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a .... A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a lot of myths and is also an interesting read on how some people have become extremely successful through luck and perseverance.,5
"Good book with excellent other books references. This book has some good chapters, mainly the first one when he really talks about the secret to success — HARD WORK! But also gave a good reference to Hofstede work, which I was not familiar with! For that I am very thankful!",3
Outliers. It gets a little slow talking about airline pilots. The way he begins and ends it is amazing just stick with it and it will open your eyes.,5
"Food for thought. There were many examples that were good but not enough emphasis on the whole point. I was kind of left thinking, ok, did I miss something? What was the conclusion? Some of the examples seemed far fetched and I wanted to glean from the writers knowledge something useful for me and mine. Not so sure that happened!",3
"good book. starts strong and interesting, gets a bit boring and a bit repetitive towards the end.",4
"Another article turned into a book. This is yet another article turned into a 300 page book. Only the first two chapters are worth a read. The author writing style is boring, repetitive, and predictable. This author is clearly over-rated.",2
Charles Achibiri. Simply brilliant. Every parent should read or listen to this book. Malcolm takes you on a journey of self-reflection.,5
Five Stars. great product fast shipping!,5
"Super interesting read!. Such great thoughts, and a very good writer. This book kept me engaged and intrigued with every story and example that led to the final brilliant conclusion.",5
"Outliers. The research supporting the authors thesis was quite interesting. Altogether, I thought the book had some interesting insights and it was an easy read.",4
"Outliers. Excellent study on success! If you have ever wondered about why success is easy for some and difficult for others, this read is for you. Very interesting.",5
"Great and informative read when focused. I really liked this book. It took me a few months to read because I didn't find it as gripping as other writings, so I would often read a couple of books and come back to it. I challenged myself to focus over the last week and I'm so glad that I did. This was a wonderful book and it has opened my eyes to a better way of thinking about success.",4
Just wow!. A very good book to read. It contains the story of some successful peoples and the reasons for their success. If you've chosen this book definitely you'll find your answer in this book. It motivates you and filled you with energy to do something.,5
"The Building of exceptional Children. A book every parent of school age children should read. What does equality of opportunity really mean? Knowing how the game is played, and how that will affect your child's success is thought provoking. If you have a child with talents or abilities this book could help you maximize his chances for great success.",5
"eye opening. it gathers a series of different outliers and explains the particular settings that made this possible, eye opening and very concrete.",5
"Sad Allegory. As an American, I truly prefer a tale which is much less serendipitous. This is a perspective from entitled, elitist.... there is some truth... and ancestry provided advantages..... but discouraging synopsis for anyone midlife.",3
Interesting ready by a talented writer.. Very interesting read by a talented writer. Mr. Gladwell knows how to captivate and educate at the same time. Fascinating.,5
"A must read book for those seeking life success!. Malcolm Gladwell is a thoughtful and knowledgeable writer of topics that make us all think about our lives as we know it. In Outliers, Gladwell explains that our environment and interactions shape us greater than we perceive. What do you believe?",5
Book ordered. The book came in perfect condition. As it was a present for a friend I was delighted and would recommend this seller.,5
Eh..... This book was okay for awhile. I got bored with it halfway through. I suppose it's a philosopher type of thing.,2
Outstanding!. I never looked at success in this way. I'll never look at it the same again!,5
Malcolm Gladwell always provides a thought provoking experience. Great book! Love the different frameworks of thought that Malcolm provides when working through problems.,5
"How timely!. The recent crash of the Asiana Airlines flight into San Francisco was a page right out of Outliers! Instead of wondering how that crash could have happened, I understood it more than I would have believed possible, because of Gladwell's book.",5
"interesting, informative and eye-opening. Now I have a better understanding of who I am, and how just a few tweaks would have made all the difference in my life.",5
Five Stars. Really enjoyed the book. Breaks a rooted idea linking economic success only with effort.,5
"A seminal work!. Outliers looks at how successful people achieve success. Shaped by faith, culture, ""chance,"" and work, no one achieves success on their own! An insightful work looking into the facts and the soul of success, in whatever way you may define it. The last few chapters moved me to tears and the stirring epilogue, stamped the theme of this book powerfully on my heart; I hope it moves you as it moved me! Truly, a seminal work!!",5
"Five Stars. Great book. So much research went into this and it shows, plus it is well written.",5
Anything but boring. Super interesting as he studies the folks at the edges of statistics and why they are amazingly successful. It makes being normal just too boring.,5
Great Read. I have heard of this book and just recently downloaded the Kindle version - not disappointed at all :) . A great read...lots of stories you have heard of before all in one good book.,5
"Five Stars. Malcolm's ""One, two three and a puff of smoke"" is always pithy, entertaining and informative.",5
Lots of boring stats. Not the best book I have read. Lots of boring stats and never really felt like the book was getting anywhere. Was hoping for a twist or punch at the end but unfortunately just more stats.,2
Five Stars. It' a good book,5
Five Stars. A PRESENT!,5
"In My List of Best Books. Enjoyable to read, practical for use and scientific for analysis.",5
Five Stars. One of my favorite books ever - sent this off on a book-donation-gig.,5
