Outliers. Interesting facts to keep in mind for having more opportunities in life. Specially that we can improve with our efforts,4
"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected. You can also see the influences of his family in his life. His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician. Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha). Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success. Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",5
"Gladwell Classic. One of my all time favorite books, which lead me to more Malcolm Gladwell books. He’s the best.",5
good book. good writing,5
Who knew it does take a village. Great book that confirms or gives you new incite as to what it takes to be the best.,5
"Interesting and insightful. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell quite a bit. Each of his books offers a bit of a different take on a main topic. I think that Outliers is one of my more favorites, probably because it felt like there was more stories.",5
"Gladwell always delivers!. Another well crafted series of stories that beautifully illustrate his thesis. This time, it's about luck and hard work, historical timing, cultural norms and the intricate web that makes us who we are.",5
Learn how to take advantage of the opportunities. One great book with lots of knowledge to be learned from it.  Everyone has there own opportunities but how they choose to utilize it can make a big difference. For everyone is smart.,5
Great insight but could have been 80% shorter. First two hours or so filled me with wonder a very different view on the world. Really gripping and interesting however the next five are rather disappointing. Kept listing because I had a fever and absolutely nothing else to do... Especially fifth word by word analysis of a rather uninteresting cockpit discussion (ten minutes each) was fatal. Only a rather slow four year old would not have gotten the point after the first two. However would buy for first few hours. Overall style of writing is good and narrator is enjoyable.,4
Good theory but poor writing. The book presents different but very convincing views towards things about success we thought we get used to and we thought we well understood. It makes me rethink what exactly makes a person succeed. That's a very good lesson to myself and also child raising.,4
"great book. speedy shipping. great book. speedy shipping,",5
"A Unique View of Success. This book has a different perspective on what makes people successful. It's not just rugged individulalism that determines greatness. A lot of other factors need to be there - opportunity, location, timing and even a little luck. There are some points that I don't agree with. But, as always Gladwell gets you to really look at things differently. If you study success and the successful you will want to add this book to your list. If you get the audio book as I did, make sure you listed to the interview at the end.",5
Dope. Dope. Really enjoyed this book! Gladwell does an amazing job at making you realize things you didn't pay attention to before.,5
Phenomenal!. Malcolm Gladwell's research provides that much more stability and allows for that much more purchase area as I continue to work atop his and many others' shoulders.,5
"This is not another Blink or Tipping Point. If you've come here thinking that Malcolm Gladwell's latest book could well be a repeat of his previous two instalments, then you are going to go away disappointed. This is definitely not in the same league as the previous two books.",3
"A MUST read!. This book is a must read for everyone; it will change the way you view success. I really enjoyed reading this book and as an educator of gifted and talented children it really made me contemplate our screening, as well as the success of those individuals I teach. What an amazing book with facts and statistics to back everything up. Great story format... LOVED it and am have loaned my copy out multiple times since purchasing!",5
Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to .... Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?,5
"Five Stars. Great Read, had to for a class, but honestly it's a good read either way.",5
"Most interesting book I have read in a long time. While there exist a plethora of books and studies on the lives of successful people, Gladwell's treatment of the subject goes in a whole new direction that provides new insight into what makes successful people tick and how we can use that knowledge to improve people's lives. Very well-written and readable.",5
"Great insight.. I loved it, very in depth look into culture and how they shape our unconscious mind. How we can inherently make decisions based upon our ancestors struggles or work ethics.",5
Very Good. Very Easy Listen With Eye Opening Information About Outliers,5
Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable. I found myself repeating much of his findings and points in everyday conversation about success. Highly recommend and am continuing to read more by him.,5
"great. I loved it. His voice is easy to listen to as well, which I look for in an audio book.",5
Five Stars. Infinitely interesting.,5
"good book. Really enjoying it so far. You have to be able to ""think outside the box"" to get the full impact.",4
"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",5
Story of successful people. I like about the general facts that are exist in this book.,5
"Great story, well told.. This is the origin of the so-called 10,000-hour rule, although Gladwell disavows it. One needn't agree with everything he asserts, but it makes you think, like a novel might.",5
Four Stars. Gladwell is fun reading.,4
"Interesting Ideas for an average reader. While Gladwell brings up interesting theories about our inheritances, he does not actually prove anything and thus the book is more entertaining than scientific.",3
"Interesting but wordy and diffuse. Very interesting subject drawn out far to long in my opinion, in order to make it book length.",3
"So interesting! Would recommend. It was a great book, highly recommended",5
"This was a great book to think outside of the box. This was a great book to think outside of the box. It makes me view the world in a completely different manner than I use to. It has made me reevaluate how I am raising my 3 years old daughter. She is thriving more than ever, since I have changed my parenting, because of this book.",5
"Seems anecdotal in nature, but don't be fooled, there is a theme there. Reading Malcolm Gladwell is like watching the PBS series ""Connections"". In both cases, the author (and the narrator) brings up several interesting but initially unconnected historical stories, and then ties them altogether at the end to show the advancement of a science or an ideology. Very interesting.",5
"Best book ever written. Period. I can honestly say, this book has changed my entire outlook on life for the better. Really understanding that there is more to life than we think, can really humble you, and motivate you at the exact same time. That is exactly what this book will do for you. Malcom Gladwell can do no wrong. Amazing!!!",5
Five Stars. good book- recommend it,5
Five Stars. Brilliant read,5
Enjoyed the individual stories on success. Personal work. Individuals success stories,5
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Read with an open mind this book is definitely a life changer. One of the most inspirational and motivational book to date.",5
"Interesting. Love the book. Fascinating from cover to cover. Makes me rethink a few things. Luck is a big contributor to success. Turns out 10,000 hours and a number of other things, even going back generations and culture are also at work. Loved it.",5
"Fascinating book!. I found the stats very fascinating! I am not done with the book yet, but I am excited to see how it ends.",4
Mindset Altering. This book was so well written and was told in a way that captured your attention. It has me thinking in a whole new way.,5
"Worth the read. I liked this book, it has good insight and is thought provoking.",5
"Amazing. I started reading this and there were some great individual stories but didn't see where it was coming together. Mr. Gladwell is an amazing writer that I believe we do not have enough of. I believe this young man could write a book on watching paint dry and you would say that it was the best book written. Am now reading ""David and Goliath"".",5
Brilliant. Supremely Fascinating!,5
Worth talking about. The subjects and stories spur discussions with co-workers and friends that continue as new readers join the conversation. The insights are thought provoking and coincidences surprising. I found it fun to read and difficult to put down. Any book that is talked about on a regular basis is better than most. It may no be life changing but it will certainly give you a new perspective on success and who is successful.,5
"Not so. Outliers is a fun/interesting read. But it needs to be taken with a great deal of salt.........I just checked for the hell of it the birthdays of both hockey teams Canada and US, who just finished the Vancouver Olympics. Mr. Gladwell remarks regarding this topic is utterly false. One does NOT have to be born in Jan. or Feb. to succeed in hockey. The star Sydney Crosby was born on Aug.7th, Brooks Orpik Sept.26th, Ryan Miller July 17th, Marc Andre Fleury Nov.28th, and a famous "" oldie "" Mario Lemieux Oct.5th.........And the list goes on.......",1
Very insightful!. This book helped to bring a new frame of reference. The way outliers become who they are and their path was very intriguing. Definitely a good read!,4
Freaking Awesome. One of the best books I have read that offers an interesting and relevant approach to some of society's common issues that affects how people view success. It humanises the Socias sciences. I had my 13 year old daughter read it which allowed her to gain confidence in her ability to become better in the activities she wishes to put the effort into.,5
Awesome. Awesome,5
Not what I expected. I had seen this title recommended by a few sources and thought I should give it a try.,5
Five Stars. Came in perfect condition.,5
Five Stars. I'm a huge fan but this book was incredible,5
"thought-provoking. Not sure if this means though hard work you can make it or without luck you never can, but it gives much food for thought.",5
"Must read!. Such a captivating story told as always by Malcolm. Really provides much-needed context on success, achievements, and the meaning of outliers in humanity.",5
book. Our son loved this book so I bought it with every intension to read it but have not read it yet!! But my 34 yr old son who is extremly successfull loved it!,5
Five Stars. My son loves it.,5
pleasure to read. Fascinating read and one that almost anyone can enjoy. I'll bee back for more Gladwell.,5
interesting. the subject is interesting and the stories behind each outlier fun to listen to. the narrator/ author has an easy voice to listen to. I would recommend.,5
"Outliers-Keith. Outliers is another insightful look by Malcolm Gladwell at what factors contribute to extraordinary performance by individuals in many walks of life. Not that you can take those insights and make yourself extraordinary, but you understand that there are opportunities that present themselves to you throughout your life that can make a difference, depending how you respond to them. A quick read that offers pause for reflection and a refreshing look at the dynamics of success.",4
"Very enlightening, changes how you view things,. Very enlightening, changes how you view things, definitely worth your time. words words words words",5
"A Self-Help Book You Can't Pass Up!. Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is. Reading this book will give you an entirely different outlook on not only the world around you but also our worlds history and how today has come to be. This book is a #1 national bestseller for a reason and you will not regret making the decision to read it!",5
Inspiring and Insightful. Simply one of the best books I've read in recent memory. Gladwell makes Outliers an easy yet enjoyable and provocative read. Must buy.,5
"Racist, biased, and fatalistic approach to people. I heard about this book from the 10k hour rule and that was the only part I gleaned anything from.  As the book went on I felt more and more distanced from the authors clearly opinionated text.  As for the audio there was a slight ringing when my volume was high.  The actual performance was good itself.  I wouldn't recommend this book in the future.",3
Good read. Very Interesting book.,5
"Could Malcolm Gladwell and Carol Dweck.... Could Malcolm Gladwell and Carol Dweck (Mindset)...please write a book, give a Ted talk together...It would lead to lots of Thanks.",5
An easy read. Malcom gladwell is a great writer,5
"Fascinating and thought-provoking.. While reading this book, I have recounted different parts of it to at least ten people. It just makes my mind whirl. Also it is just a fun read, very clear conversational in style.",5
"Decent Read. I am generally a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, but this was not one of my favorites. Seemed a bit repetitive. Some good insight, but not so many of the ah-ha moments that I am used to from his books.",3
Five Stars. Soooo interesting. Hard to put down really !!,5
"Very Interesting Read. If you like nonfiction with lots of aha moments, this one is a good choice. My son and I took a driving trip, and the non-driver read it to the driver. We spent lots of time talking about the contents. A really good aha read!",5
"Awesome!!!. I have not even finished the book, but I am so captivated that I can hardly put it down. I tell everyone I know what a great book it is because I find it useful on so many levels. It makes me think of both my personal professional growth and my parenting skills, and it gives me ideas for ways to improve upon both of them. <br /><br />I am always impressed by Gladwell's ability to break down what appears to be a simple concept into different equally important layers that I never would have considered. The reasearch is impeccable, and the conclusions make practical, realistic sense. If you are someone who associates and/or works with people of varied socioeconomic backgrounds, the evidence of Gladwell's conclusions are obvious. <br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone. It is AWESOME!!!",5
Gladwell's best book yet. Malcolm Gladwell's ability to bring together various research findings into a provocative theory is exceptional.,5
Mind Blowing. This is on the Marine Corps reading list for a reason. The amount of mind blowing information that's enjoyable to listen is breathtaking. Will probably listen this amazing book again.,5
"Great and with awkward results!!. To be an outlier, is simple. Keep reading!!",5
"One of the best books I ever read. One of the best books I ever read. To me the message is inspirational and I relayed this inspirational message to my children-you can achieve your desired goals but you have to put the time in-10,000 hours!!!",5
Wow thats why people are succesful.. Was guided to this book by one of my sons rugby coaches. Well worth the read. Even if you haven't got a son/daughter who is talented and are getting frustrated by their lack of application this book is worth reading. Ever wondered why people are succesful well here is the answer.,5
Anecdotal. Relies too much on anecdotal reports and too little statistical evidence. It was entertaining but nothing more. I would not buy it again.,2
"Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.. I also found the data employed in this chapter to be misleading. Considering how few people have the IQs you reference, it is essentially impossible to get enough data to make reliable conclusions. Just because factors like emotional intelligence matter should not discount the value of actual or intellectual intelligence. In fact, if IQ is such a crude measurement system (which most people realize), then why use it at all to ""prove"" your theory? The idea that Einstein's level of intelligence was not that important to his success simply disregards reality. Unfortunately, this chapter, with its labored attempts to prove that we all have what it takes - that the smart kids are no better - seems to me like a bit of sophistry that once again makes people feel better about themselves and has undoubtedly resulted in the widespread embrace of this book in our school system that is soft and overly-sensitive when it comes to success and failure. he ideas explained in ""The Matthew Effect"" did seem to hold some water, however, and I could relate. My school district has an enrichment program that tests students to see if they are eligible in the early years of elementary school. Once in the program, you basically do not leave. Not that we are in high school, it is very clear that many of the students in the program do not belong there. At the time we were tested, age certainly made a difference. In fact, for the first several years of the program, I remember that all of the students in it (myself included) were among the oldest in their respective grades. This was probably the best chapter in the book, as you backed up your claims very well. While reading it, I questioned whether I still belong in the enrichment program many times. It was an interesting point to make, and it did give me a bit of a new perspective. espite the aspects of the book I did not like, I do appreciate that you attempt to answer the question of success. Frankly, I feel that it is unanswerable. It certainly is a fascinating topic. incerely, ichael Gildin",2
"A great read!. A very interesting and thought provoking read, thoroughly enjoyable!",5
Fascinating and fun. Malcolm covers many different types of successful people and simple explains that such success is based on opportunity just as much as work ethic.,5
"Well written, excellent read. Highly recommended.. Thought provoking ideas, challenging our very way of thinking about Success are explained simply and clearly. Well written. I wish to get latest version to understand some of recent successes in the internet field. Hope to find similar books to analyze success within Indian culture and context!",5
Best book I've read in a while. Makes you see things from a totally different prospective and connects the past with the future,5
"Some Great Insights. I was a big fan of Galdwell`s first two books, the Tipping Point, and Blink.",4
"Flawed science. Bad science heaped upon a completely unsubstantiated premise! Malcolm ASSUMED that the reason the people in a village lived so long was because of their social structure. I repeat ASSUMED! He then goes on to turn this into FACT basing the remainder of the book on this assumption. Sounds like either side of global warming. Or, perhaps, both sides simultaneously!",1
Great topic. The students were excited to get this book.,5
"Four Stars. Interesting perspective and I've referenced it often. Really common sense, though. It is the way life works.",4
Highly recommended. Excellent,5
"Good. Very good, important food for thought. Didnt give 5 stars because I felt a little bit of it was slightly convuluted jumping from one story to another and back again. But overall very good.",4
Fascinating agent of change. Everybody would benefit from learning what an outlier is!!,5
Highly recommended. Outstanding Book,5
"Some interesting insights, but more proof needed. Gladwell has some very interesting insights into success and I must admit that it opened my eyes to the background of successful people. However, many of the relationships touted between success and social factors are correlative, I would have liked to see him expound further to elucidate the causal relationship.",3
"kinda boring. high expectation for this book, but after reading half the book, i stopped. I felt like things were jumping around and many things are already obvious to me",3
Familar but Different (Another Good Read). If you enjoyed his other book this is very much in the same style and quality. It was thought provoking and enjoyable in the same way Blink and Tipping were without relying on reiterating parts of his past books.,4
"Excellent product. Excellent product, delivered on time Thank you",5
Five Stars. love it,5
"Fantastic read. While it doesn’t go into further depth with some of the statistics and concepts, the ideas and the way they are presented make this a fantastic book. Finished it in less than a week. On to his next, Tipping Point.",5
"great narration. Challenges so many preconceived notions about success, while still advocating hard work. Would recommend to anyone trying to both improve themselves and how they view status.",5
"Perfect Narration. interesting topics, smooth writing, and top notch narration. would recommend for anyone even slightly considering to get it.",5
"Great Book!. I very much enjoyed the book with the interesting insights and comparisons. Success can be attributed to luck, hard work and opportunities.",5
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze .... I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze why and how distinguished people are so brilliant and superior, but the way that Gladwell presented his points gave a logical and tangible understanding of the abstract concept of success. (Also, the amount of research he did is astonishing.)  recommend this book to everyone!",4
"Extremely Helpful. The facts of life contained in this book should be shared everywhere. So many gems of wisdom would benefit the potential outliers as children, if they only knew what hard work can become. One thing to note is there were opportunities to make less sacrifices in each of the cases discussed, but these outliers had a mindset to aggressively pursue their area of interest in every opportunity granted to them. Many will not have exceptional opportunities ever at their doorstep, but for those few who have only one exceptional opportunity, this book should be taught early so that they can begin to evaluate opportunities in a much more educated way.",5
Interesting & thought provoking. This book was written in such a way that you enjoyed learning what was presented to you without really feeling the weight or tedium of what was being presented. The idea that “some people are just lucky / better / blessed…” is brought up and disproven chapter after chapter and example after example.,5
"The term I've coined for books such as these is ""the illusion of erudition.""",2
Very interesting. Opened my perspective about the world in a way like no other ! Never knew so many things in life lie beneath the surface and are beyond the obvious.,4
"Truthful and eye insightful. I liked it a lot. It was recommended reading by a friend that knows me. The book was very much in sync with many of my thoughts. I saw these traits in many places around the world. I traveled around the world for 15+ years and was out of this country 20+ weeks a year. Speaking a number of languages (6) it was easy to see these traits, strengths and talents in multiple countries. Speaking the languages was very helpful to understand the necessary traits.",5
Excellent look at life in a different perspective. Very interesting look at life. I have not finished the book yet.,5
"This book  OUTLIERS is interSeting. However, it could be much clearer if reframed in the idea/truth of REINCARNATION.. - WHERE certan attributes are passeed on from one incarnation to another",2
i loved. i loved it its a great book with a lot of great content i recommend,5
"A lot of insight into preparing your children for life.. This book can help make a lot of sense out of your life or your families life. Clear and well written. Malcolm Gladwell is a good story teller. He gives a fairly compelling argument about how important preparation is so that when opportunity comes along you are ready. Malcolm Gladwell who reads the book himself, is also a good reader.",5
Interesting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have been a fan of Gladwell since reading Tipping Point. Interesting the points that he makes regarding the impact of historical events on the individuals within the book.,5
"fantastically inspirational.. The Calvinist in me says ,""I told you so we are not in control."" The parent in me says that life is a grand adventure and only those that are prepared for the opportunities will be able to take advantage of the ""luck"" spoken of here. A worthy read for sure.",5
"30 pages in my book were just missing. Well it would be great to know what happens after page 16, my book didn't print anything after that until page 49.",1
"A Must Read. This is an excellent book and highly recommended for those that want to get a clear picture of how some succeed and other do not. The author points out that many factors come into play for success how ever one may define success. Success is sometime a matter of chance circumstance, rather than hard work.",5
This book is an Outlier. This book is phenomenal. The intellectual setups within the stories around success are one of a kind. This book sets to debunk myths and ideas around how people attain success. It’s looks at individuals and situations and holds a magnifying glass to it to study the different set of factors that contribute to creating these success outliers. This is a must read.,5
Great product. Good quality and a damn good read,5
A great Read. This is a read that all should indulge in.It answers many questions,5
"It was a great consumer experience. It came in the exact condition as described. You get what you buy. It was a great consumer experience. And if I might add, it was a really good read. It was very thought-provoking, and it truly opened my eyes to see how the influences around you change how you think, live, and succeed in life.",5
"Bite sized stories of success. My first Gladwell made me regret I'd waited so long to discover to discover this prolific author. His analysis of successful people was entertaining, humorous, and thoughtful. He did his best to have as global a perspective possible and to help the reader follow his train of thought. Can't wait to read more of his work!",4
"Well put together. Enticing story telling, captivating narration, interesting topics, often fascinating way of looking at common statistics available for all to grasp. So this is how the world works?!",5
Fabulous!. good,5
Enjoyed and learned a lot. This book has amazing details about how a person becomes an outlier. I learned this is not only a matter of hard work but also luck has a lot to do with it. The luck which starts many years before the outlier becomes an outlier.,5
"I highly recommend this book.. An incredible book for those seeking leadership ideas. Anything is possible with time, hard work and dedication. I highly recommend this book.",5
Love it. Love it,5
A rational and sober explanation of events which might otherwise seem miraculous. Provides accessible insight and great clarity without the need for grandiose language or overly complex analogies. Gladwell states his case with style and grace. Both informative and entertaining - worth the money.,4
Insightful. One of the more insightful books I've read.I wish I read this 10 years ago!,5
Three Stars. as expected,3
"Very Well Articulated.. The writing is simply spectacular, and Orwell does a great job of explaining the sociological elements that can determine success and failure. I've read it a couple of times, and it is inspiring each time. This is definitely a recommended read for anyone.",5
"I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.",5
"Amazing. The best book I have ever read. Such an amazing mix of humour, adventure and life. Interesting from the first word",5
"Okay. I honestly have not finished this book. I just could not get into it. The concepts are interesting enough but if you are looking for a read with some sort of story line this definitely is not the book. When I have more time on my hands i will give it another go. however, there is no rush to do so.",3
"Fun and Informative. Although Gladwell has been taken to task for over simplifying things, Outliers is still intriguing because it gives you a glimpse of processes that happen invisibly in our daily lives. It will also make you count up how many hours you've been practicing certain things and maybe decide whether it's worth it to continue... Gladwell reads his own book well. Listen if you enjoy learning about all those little things you may have once wondered about successful people but never had the time to go find out yourself.",4
Magnificent book!. This book is a Must Read for anyone who loves to think and know stuff. It is a brave book because it looks behind what our society at large wants us to believe and speaks the truth but with kindness and hope for a better future.,5
Five Stars. Great Book!,5
A Model for Communicating Complex Ideas in an Interesting Way. Malcolm Gladwell's genius is to write interestingly about complex ideas and show their relevance to us.,5
A must read!. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing this book!,5
Five Stars. good,5
good. good,5
One of the best. Very in-depth research delivered in a fascinating descriptive style of story telling. Thank you.,5
"a totally fascinating book. A fascinating book, filled with interesting stories and enlightening facts, all told in a very entertaining style. Cannot wait to read Maxwell's next book. This book has important implications for parents, educators, trainers and policy makers all. If you are considering reading it, don't pass up the chance.",5
"Informative, delightful, could change your life.. An easy to listen to story of greatness that comes from the blend of adequate skill, culture, and exceptional opportunity!",5
Interesting Read. Interesting read but why do I have to write this Amazon? I am just looking to read for a few minutes to elevate my insomnia and this is not helping.,4
Yet another Tipping Point.. A fascinating look at how history influences the outcomes of individuals in a number of different cases. You've probably never thought about the world in this way before.,5
"Five Stars. Great, positive experience reading this book. Recommended.",5
"I wish I had read this book years ago. So much insight on how people become successful, I wish I had read this book years ago. Everyone should read this book.",5
"Malcolm does a great job in telling the stories to help you connect .... This is a fascinating book that is a must read for any business person, entrepreneur, athlete, parent, or any person who has an interest in what factors are needed for people to become successful.",5
"Four Stars. Though I did really enjoy reading this book, I was disappointed that it was such a short book.",4
"Challenging conventional wisdom. This book is about challenging many of the ideas or bias we have about successful people, in particular, the people considered to be ""outliers"". For example, a lot people and parents think that talent and hard work is everything you need to success, and they could be right until certain degree, but the truth is that real outliers achieve success because there a lot of other additional factors contributing to their success besides innate talent and hard work.",5
Interesting thoughts. Which sound convincing. In India we often see lives transformed based on this critical opportunity. Have seen many brilliant careers subdued cause of a lack of exposure a sense of entitlement that many don't have.,4
Conditions. Great conditions,5
"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",4
"Interesting and Inspiring. I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.",5
Mostly fluff. Kind of a good book with the 10000 hour rule and everything but the rest is mostly fluff for me.,3
Amazing book. A good book worth reading,5
"Amazing Page Turner!. Gladwell has an incredible voice and captivating story that everyone should hear. His story is easily understood, but has huge ramifications for how we live our lives, tell our personal stories, and how we should think about our society. My highest recommendation!",5
"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",3
Outliers Rocks. Old book. Still absolutely relevant.,5
Good read!. Good book and daughter enjoyed the story.,4
Outliers. Brilliant explanation of how luck and hard work are intertwined in how a person or people become successful and also how some smart people don't!,5
Five Stars. great book,5
"Intriguing book. I was very intrigued by the first half of the book. Great ideas regarding the influence birthday cutoffs have on our future development path. However, the second half seemed to wander and I didn't feel there was a connection to the concepts presented in the first half.",4
An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be .... Really interesting pop psychology/sociology. An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be regurgitating down the pub later.,5
Five Stars. not as good as tipping point but an interesting read all the same,5
"It puts success into perspective. This book is an honest depiction of how chance and privilege, culturally manifested in different societies and time, dictate patterns of success.",5
Interesting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have been a fan of Gladwell since reading Tipping Point. Interesting the points that he makes regarding the impact of historical events on the individuals within the book.,5
Very good read.. This work was very insightful and I would recommend to anyone who likes to think critically about society. Gladwell tackles some of the most thought provoking nuances of our time.,5
"Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey .... 2/3 done the book. Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey references :) Has made me look at 'secrets of success' a little harder, and with a circumspection that I didn't have before.",4
"Enjoyable!. This Gladwell book has a little bit of everything, covering topics from I.Q. ratings to plane crashes to health and wellness...I believe that readers from a range of different ages and careers will enjoy this book and take a lot from the contents. As usual, Gladwell writes in an engaging, concise style that is easy to comprehend. He does a great job of pulling the varied topics together at the end of each chapter or major section. This book certainly made me consider some of my previous thoughts and notions about where success comes from and how we achieve many types of success.",5
Five Stars. excellent book!,5
"Interesting, short, straightforward. 1) It's not a long book.",4
Five Stars. Excellent review on success!!,5
"Great, quick read.. What a way to put success into perspective! This book points out what success looks like and what serendipity looks like. Little life lessons presented in an easy, readable format. Great for anyone with a toddler going off to pre-school to a teenager going off to college. This is not a self-help book. Instead, it is a book of anecdotes that, when put together, illustrate what some successful people have in common.",5
Good read. Very Interesting book.,5
"A bit boring. I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book. To be honest it’s a bit boring and author goes around same subject again and again. We stoped reading midway through. I don’t know may be it is a matter of taste, but we didn’t like it.",2
"Thought-provoking and important for our time.. I have enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's ideas since I first heard him speak on WNYC's ""Radiolab"" program. I decided to read his book ""Outliers"" to further satiate that curiosity.",5
Five Stars. Loved it!,5
"Fantastic, very interesting. This was a very easy read/listen. l feel like I learned a lot and the stories were great.",5
Brace yourself for an AWESOME paradigm shift! This book will rock your world!. A total MUST READ!!!,5
Outliers: the story of sucess. It is an extraordinary book. It teaches you to be on the look out for opportunities. The many bits of biographical data in it are quite amazing and inspiring. It is a must read!,5
food for thought. Great read! Thought provoking.,5
"Finally - A GREAT BOOK!. For the most part, after reading a book I simply can't stand it...most books could realistically be a 2 page magazine article, but this book was packed with info, examples, and research.",5
"Food for thought book. I enjoy books that are thought-provoking. Really is more of an informative book with lots of interesting observations to ponder. Honestly, I am still reading it so I'm not sure what my true final thoughts will be",4
"Must read for anybody who wants to be somebody.. Great research. This book's story tells you, it's not luck or talent, rather hard work and good timing to become great.",5
"Gladwell makes you think. If you don't want to just 'consume' books and you enjoy inspiring thoughts, Gladwell won't disappoint you. He is using illustrative examples from real world, easy to remember, easy to believe.",4
Thought provoking. Wonderful book providing many thought provoking and interesting analyses. I bought this on my manager's recommendation to get back into reading and boy did it do the trick! I'm halfway through Tipping Points now and enjoying it immensely.,5
Highly recommended. Different view on success,5
It's a good book.. It's a good book. A different perspective for sure. Sometimes the author will do a little bit of stretching but I believe it was important so he coudl get his point across. Worth reading.,4
"Really nice book!. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in understanding society, the goods and the bads. It gives a different perspective of ideas you already have.",4
"Simple Yet Complex. This was my 1st Malcolm Gladwell AudioBook, I also read along w/ a copy of the book. The examples used are golden in how they intertwine lessons about culture, environment, & oppurtunities given. This is a must read for any (young or old) entrepreneur or someone wanting to understand how someone comes to bestow the chances at success. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell!",5
"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable. Plus it gets the reader thinking about what causes success and makes an argument that is not often expressed outright - basically no man is an island and no one is a truly self-made man. Lots of great examples throughout the book to support the argument.",3
"Intrigued. I found myself highlight a lot of text and if there was one thing that was accomplished - he forced me to consider a different perspective, I was not comfortable with the ending however. I found it hard to accept as a good ending to the story. Maybe because it should have been a separate book and this wasn't the right setting for where his personal story could have gone. The ending was heavy and took the book in a totally different direction and didn't bring all of his points together .",3
"Great insight and the stories to prove it. This book was a pleasure to read. The thought progression was clear and easy to follow. The points were made by interesting stories and human examples that kept you wanting more. The points from how to become an expert, to how that expertise is used is clear and insightful. Malcolm Gladwell made his case and proved it well.",4
Worth reading. Interesting read. Still haven't finished it because the book drags in some places.,3
"Interesting, well written and thought provoking.. It's one of those books where you keep telling people snippets of information (badly reproduced)",5
boring book. I felt like he could say what he wanted to say in half an hour. The book basically talks about same things over and over. We know all this. Nothing new and nothing that will enrich my life.,2
"Very thought provoking. This book really shines light on the stigmas of success and how it can redirect our attention to the background of those who are seen as elite. Good book, made alot of sense.",5
"success. very empowering, there's a reason for every success story. sometimes we make excuses for ourselves by relying on our circumstances. create your own story",5
Five Stars. A PRESENT!,5
keys to successful kids to adults. The detailed reports is a eye opener to thought process and hard work is the key to successful lifestyle,5
WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,5
"Fascinating. This was so interesting and also well-written and well-read--he could have gone on with many more examples and I would have just kept listening! Particularly interesting to me was the information on intelligence and highly intelligent people. I love the idea that a certain IQ is ""smart enough"" and beyond does not predict increased success. I do know at least one person who is Mensa-certifed who was never able to hold a job or attain any level of success. Also, it is nice to know that good, old-fashioned hard work accounts for most of success that people achieve.",5
"Thought provoking. The main thesis of the book is interesting and thought provoking. There are, I believe, many other factors to consider regarding what makes an Outlier the successful person they are. Environment, and opportunities for growth and development are crucial, that is true. I would also give ample credit to the Outlier's ability to be causative in their environment, and to find or even create opportunities for themselves. All of these factors and more will cumulatively create the outcome. A great book for a book club discussion!",4
"Thought Provoking Read. More than once I thought of Acts 17:26 while reading Outliers. The NLT translation says, ""From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries."" God sets the time and place for us to be born, it is up to us to partner with him for our high calling to be fulfilled. Therein lies the Outlier secret. Very thought provoking book, I will never forget the 10,000 hour rule of mastery, and strive to reach it in order to do what I was made for, while I can.",4
Five Stars. Enjoyed thoroughly!,5
"Not a big fan.. This book makes the case that success comes from your background more than anything. Luck plays a bigger role than anything? So if you don't consider yourself a success, just give up and blame society and your ancestors. He doesn't down play the hard work but...",1
outstanding and very enlightening. loved it wanted to hear more could not put it down beautifully narrated by the author.,5
"Excellent Book on Developing Skills. This book is filled with examples and data that are convincing to support the hours one needs to experience and invest to develop a particular skill to the professional level. The book cites successful and creative individuals. It opens the eyes on what is required to be an ""expert"" and serve a community or society. Excellent book.",5
Five Stars. Came just as described. Thanks!,5
"Amazing book!!. Fantastic writer, of course, but also amazing book. Loaded with information that is very interesting. I would recommend this book to parents, teachers, educators, counselors, psychologists....actually anyone who is interested in sociology and psychology.",5
"View-changing read!. This book was given as a reading assignment in my college English class. At points it made me angry about my life and what I had been given, through no choice of my own. I kept reading and I finally realized that this book allowed me to understand life as I know it. Gladwell writes to entertain and inform. Not once did I find it dull.",5
"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",4
Really interesting reading. It explains a lot of different thing about differences.,5
I haven't started it. I hadn't even started the book this was just the beginning area. 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑,2
"so so. I've been told by so many that this is a wonderful book, a ""must read"" even from a college professor.",3
Excellent book. Excellent narration by Malcom Gladwell. I enjoyed the different stories used in the book and enjoyed as well the logic Malcom used as he describe each Outlier case.,4
"why some succeed and some do not. I , having a mid year birthday, made note of those born in January and also those in December and that the year's difference in age made a difference in their schooling. I have also done some ethnic profiling, noting in a general way that ethnicity can influence what may be termed aptitudes. Of course, any book which supports one's own views is going to get rave reviews from its readers. It is certainly worth a read.",5
Five Stars. it was a gift,5
Five Stars. Good stuff,5
"This book is a very important look at how our great innovators rise to success.. I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book. Finally, someone has come to the truth of the luck of birth at a certain time, and luck of opportunity combined with concentration by the innovator, in seizing thr oppotunity or window of time.",5
"Very poignant and thought-provoking!. I gave this book five stars, because of how deep and thought-provoking Malcolm Gladwell is. He dissects the way we value success, especially for those 'one-in-a-million' archetypes that we, as a society, so easily put on a pedestal. Malcolm delves further not just in successes, but in also the inverse: failures (sometimes in somber and heart-breakingly fatal examples).",5
"Fun and Informative Book. It was really fun to read it, and talks about different topics in an interesting writing.",5
my new best friend. just travelled half way across the us with malcolms engaging conversation all the way.  perfect travel companion,5
Don't hesitate to buy this book. Great book from a great writer. Read this and you will be thinking about it on and off for years.,5
"Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is. This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view. As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages. It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",4
Five Stars. Great book.,5
Five Stars. Great book to read to train your children to be champions!,5
"Fascinating. The ideas proposed in this text seem revolutionary to how we generally view success. Though some facets may be a bit trite, like wealth and opportunity, the research and studies done to prove why these things among others are more likely to amount to success is incredibly intriguing. My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research. For an AP Psych summer reading book, I think it is a fantastic choice as it is interesting and thought-provoking as well as an easy and good read.",4
Five Stars. Amazing to hear all the research and studies that went in to this book. Very interesting indeed.,5
Bravely written.....Joyful Read. Brilliant !,5
Xmas gift for son-in-law. Xmas gift and it was on his list so am sure he will be pleased,5
"A solid book, great stories and was enjoyable to read the whole time.. I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.",4
Good. Good,4
"Amazing author with an way of looking at the world. What an amazing book. I could go on for quite a while about how interesting and inspiring this book is for all of those who look at the world an see themselves as outliers in one way or another. It helps you fully understand the importance you society, your family, your friends, and your opportunities have on the accomplishments in your life. Inspires you to take advantage of any and every opportunity that comes your way.",5
"One of the best books I've read. One of the best books I've read. I absolutely love the conclusions he draws, though he takes a little bit of liberty with his interpretation of the data. I totally agree with what he says, though. Inspiring, uplifting, and incredibly interesting. You do not want to miss this one.",5
"I ordered two of them. Outstanding book for a high school student or above. Our MBA professor used some chapters from this book in our class; which was the first time I've read Gladwell; wished I would have had this class 20 years ago. By the book, and then by one for a friend.",5
Pop Social Science.. The first and last Malcolm Gladwell book I will read.,1
Everyone needs to be aware of this book.. Should be middle school required reading!!,5
"Interesting read. I enjoyed the book, I especially liked the stories regarding Bill Gates and also the commonality of plane cranes.",4
Five Stars. Excellent,5
"Don't waste your time or money. The story begins by eluding to possible ways where you (reader) might also become an ""Outlier"" but every example and story reverts to the same basic premise - ""You won't find greatness without advantages beyond your own merits"", ""those who were fortunate enough to be born in the months January, February, and March are the only ones who could achieve the Outlier status"", ""all advantages in life just HAPPEN to fall into place for the selected elite.""",1
"A beautiful mind!. I just love this man's brain. Whether listening to his audiobooks, podcast or interviews on talk shows, he is just so fascinating. I laughed, I cried, but most of all, I learned. :)",5
"This book rocked my world!. Mr. Gladwell makes some stunning observations. My childhood Pollyanna ideals that if you just work really hard, wealth would be easy are now replaced with real ideals. It's more than hard work - it's timing, circumstance, luck, and more. The chapter on plane crashes is absolutley fascinating. I didn't need to make it required reading for my staff - they enthusiastically embraced it with a sigh and a ""wow!"" when they finished. The chapter is an extreme example of communication across cultures. As communicators in a diverse community, my team now has a new understanding and approach to cross-culture communication. This book will make great Christmas gifts to my kids in college. I sure wish I had this book when I was in college! I recommend this book wholeheartedly!",5
Gladwell nails it ...again. I particularly liked the description of honor society in Appalachian areas-very instructive in understanding how where we come from can affect our future behavior,5
Five Stars. Very good explanation and build-out of conclusions. I highly recommend this book...,5
I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I greatly appreciate how he incorporates data and research into his logic. It gives my brain some substance to chew on. Outliers is great at pushing the reader to rethink how they evaluate success and consider what factors really effect finding it. Gladwell's writing style is very accessible and not overly academic which I also like.,4
Don't hesitate to buy this book. Great book from a great writer. Read this and you will be thinking about it on and off for years.,5
Five Stars. Great read and very thought provoking.,5
Great book. Read this book for a writing class in college and love how Gladwell thinks no matter your background you can achieve success.,4
Another great read from Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great book for anyone trying to understand all of the factors that go in to a person becoming successful. As a teacher I wish I could have all of my students read it and understand what it takes to achieve greatness.,5
"Re-frame your concept of success. Highly informative book. I love the way Gladwell makes you rethink what you think you know about success. As a former athlete it was interesting to turn the lens onto myself and figure out where I was on my journey. Read it. I will say this, don't be afraid to breeze through some paragraphs or sections when you've gotten the picture.",4
Five Stars. Good book!,5
Good!. Very interesting!,4
"Very encouraging read. I found this a very encouraging book. First of all it confirms what I tell people all the time about my career - I just work harder than everyone else which is why I tend to do very well. It also explains why others do even better, they had the opportunity of both circumstance and culture. Especially the accounts of Chris Langan and Oppenheimer...I find that my background and culture have delt me some of the same attitudes as Langman, but that it is possible to recognize this and unlearn these traits. Sadly, I see that I have already passed down some of these things to my children!",5
Not the content. This book did not contain the content I was looking for. Personal preference. The bookstore sent me an older copy too.,1
Great book. This book is so fascinating. It opens ones mind to the reality of life and opportunities. Great book!,5
Not as good as his other works. I enjoyed Blink and Tipping Point but I felt Outliers read like it was put together on short notice. The examples Gladwell used to prove his conclusions at times seemed forced; like the evidence could have been interpreted many different ways and he just manipulated it to work for his point. It was still somewhat interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for it again. Pick it up used.,3
"Fantastic book. All of his books are incredible, should be mandatory reading for the world-Very well written book And easy to the",5
Neat point of view! It really spoke to me .... Neat point of view! It really spoke to me and how I need to look at all the little details of situations and create outliers in my classroom.,4
It's in perfect condition ''new''. Item arrived on time. It's in perfect condition ''new''. Would recommend :),5
"Not bad, but not as engaging as Blink or Tipping Point. I'm a fan of Gladwell's work, but this book did not grab me with the same intellectual hook as his prior two efforts. The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me. The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",3
Save your money!. Thought this book was boring and did not make sense. Birthdays and Cultural backgrounds? I feel if there is anything we learned about success it is that men and women have been able to achieve what they wanted despite their cultural backgrounds and upbringings. Stick to the Laws of Success and having a chief aim to what you want.,1
Enjoyed and learned a lot. This book has amazing details about how a person becomes an outlier. I learned this is not only a matter of hard work but also luck has a lot to do with it. The luck which starts many years before the outlier becomes an outlier.,5
Buy this book. Love this book!,5
"Four Stars. Great book, makes clear and concise connections between demographics, history, culture and intellect.",4
Excellent. Galdwell's best work. A read for every parent who wants their child to succeed.  Thank you mr glad well. Nvhhxx,5
Outstanding success stores - Outliers. The book helped me understand the true reason for success. Everyone has the same opportunity. Go for it. Be an Outlier by reading this awesome book!,5
Easiest order & great producr. Great book. Delivered on time,5
"Good book, great writing.. The book is interesting and wonderfully written. Keep in mind though, that the author is just that: a writer. He is not a scientist and his claims are not based on fact. Interesting as they may be to think about, there is certainly no statistically relevant information to back up the majority of the claims. That being said, it's a good read and gets you thinking, which is a plus.",4
"An explanation of occurrences of phenomenal success. ....and why belief of our society as a true meritocracy is wrong. Often as a child, I was taught that this country is a place where one could pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be successful. I knew this was false narrative as some are never given the straps, and the boot is reserved for certain folks. Great read.",5
A geat author.. I found all this information and thinking fascinating and I look forward to reading other books by this author.,5
"I would recommend this to anybody. OUTLIERS identifies factors of success that are different from those we've been told about in the past. I've told everybody I know about this book and feel strongly that reading it can help parents, especially, to steer their children toward success.",5
Loved this book!. This was a great book. I read it twice!!!,5
"Not really Malcolm standard. This book reads more like trying to form some pattern within a collection of anectodes. The various stories make this book an interesting read, but somehow the explicit link to outliers is not found in some of them",2
"Outliers: The Story of Success. Repeat and repeat of why the author thought people were a success or failure. A very boring book. As a very wise lady once said to me, ""There is no sense like common sense, or degrees as long as your arm and can't wash behind their ears!!!!",1
"Interesting Facts. The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful. In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",4
"worst. Liked most of the book. The epilogue was misplaced, a little bit too wordy and repetitive. The goals of this book may be too idealistic but are worth working toward",3
"HTHOARDER.COM. Great book, very insightful. Put into perspective the reoccurring theme that no one did it on their own. That circumstances within and out of our control always play a factor.",5
Five Stars. Completely met my expectation!,5
Now I Want to Read It for Myself. Gladwell presents interesting and compelling evidence to support his thesis that the only extraordinary thing about extraordinary people is their extraordinarily good luck to be in the right place at the right time to become the best at what they love.,5
"Success has many parents. An interesting account on how some people become icons in their field. Gladwell covers everything from sports, to high-tech, to legal and entertainment professions. All with facts, opinions, and interesting biopics.",4
Great. theory changing life shifting perspective that rings true in the minds of many. Well done sir,5
good. Very interesting book! Really makes you think and view things differently!,5
Amazing FLIPKART... :). Ordered on 30th Nov and got delivered on next day 1st Dec. And book is amazing too. I have read this book 2-3 years ago. Got this for my friend. If you think a lot and enjoy reading psychology and other stuff this book is for you.,5
"90% there.. Great book. This book is a like eating a great steak and then the last bite has a bad crunch. Gratitude is where I believe he was going, instead the final chapter/interview seem to shift from gratitude into “you didn’t accomplish this, you did because someone else”. It seems to miss the hard work requirement of the individual and that individuals made every single choice. Maybe he covers that in other books. Still would recommend the book, gratitude is what I am taking away from the read.",4
"Great Resource.. Very helpful , insightful and resourceful. It ensures a heart of gratitude for the many coincidences and orchestrations that create my world of current opportunities.",5
Great for seen beyond the surface!!!!. I like it !!! I finished in just 3 days .,5
Great book that gives clarity into why some people are .... Great book that gives clarity into why some people are successful in life.,5
"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",5
"Well worth the read. In typical Malcolm Gladwell fashion, this book is both very though-provoking and preconception-challenging...a must-read for any outside-the-bix thinkers.",5
"Great book. Great book - gave it to two relatives as a gift. I especially like the chapter on how the sewing skills Jewish immigrants brought with them in the 19th century led to being their economic springboard, rising economically above other immigrant groups of the time, and making New York City the global center of textile manufacturing in 1890.",5
Highly recommended. A must read. Although gross generalisations but they hold true nevertheless.,5
"Best read.... You get to know what makes people successful. And how a little proportion of timing (of you may call luck) plays a critical role in their lives.. all but without belittling their skills, efforts and hard work.. best read..",5
Four Stars. Fascinating read.....,4
"Interesting and Entertaining. I know Gladwell's stories should be taken with a grain of salt, but this book was a very interesting read. Great anecdotes that make for interesting conversation.",5
"excellent. offers a perspective that is logical, however until reading it I would of assumed otherwise... Great Read",5
Worth the money. page quality is good but its cover pages looks a little damaged. Please take care of the products you deliver. We are paying to get fresh and new products. Thankyou.,4
"Should be on every bookshelf!. Have bought this book several times; give it as gifts, so keep having to replace it on the bookshelf! A great read and a real eye-opener!",5
"Outside the paradigm. An original piece of work. Will get you to look at some of your own cherished and well-ingrained assumptions differently. The last section of the book is riveting, a perfect coda to a thoughtful book.",5
"Chance, destiny, or fate?. Malcolm Gladwell takes a good crack at what makes great people great and comes up with their circumstances as a key ingredient - - - the when and where they were born, the cultural background of their families, the atmosphere of the times, the nature and character of their families, and on-and-on. He also mentions the innate drive and ability of the so-called outliers (those who rise above the rest of us), but says none of the success would have happened if it were not for the fortuitous circumstances.",5
Success can be perennial if handled well ..................... Excellent book with real examples of how one can convert opportunities into reality with perseverence ...............,4
Best suggestion of the semester. This was a suggested reading by one of my professors. It was a wonderful read. If you are looking for something great to read this is well worth your time. It takes some critical thinking to work beyond the face of the book and dive a little deeper into the process if you want to think.,5
"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",4
fast delivery. I bought this book on Saturday night and arrived on Monday!!! Great,5
Should have read this sooner. A good look at the factors needed to success. Gives you an idea of how you need to think going forward so you can expand your horizons and increase your chances of succeeding in whatever your goal is.,5
"Gladwell's Outliers -- what you never even noticed. Gladwell comes up with the most interesting things, and explains in depth the ""how and why"" things connect, happen and/or interact.",5
Thinking out of the box. Malcolm Gladwell is an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the world in a non-traditional way. He challenges your assumptions and gets you to think. I like that in a book. I end up penciling a lot of questions and comments in the book margins as I read Gladwell. We have been talking in our family about the ideas in this book for weeks. This book definitely sparks discussion.,4
Thought Provoking and Entertaining. Gladwell ferrets out the myths that we would like to be true but always knew weren't that simple. I'd give the book 4.5 stars because the section on education doesn't address how Finish kids manage to score the best globally while at the same time not attending school in the same proportion as the children in the far east.,5
"Great insights, but misses the point.. While he points out all of the opportunity Bill Gates had, everyone at his school had the same, but Gates did the work. Same with the Beatles, Joy, and his own mother. Everyone is given opportunities, equal no, and thus outcomes will not be equal. So to say Gates and all those who are outliers are not responsible for their achievements is false. They maybe outliers because of unique opportunities but they are also outliers because of their rugged individualism and hard work. What nation has rugged individualists and hard work as their core? The USA. What nation has forever changed the world for the improvement of all man kind because of the enormous amount of outliers we produce? The USA. So to say it is all luck takes away from those who did the damn work at their own risk.",2
Insightful and thought provoking. A very interesting and fresh set of principles that are likely keys to the differentiated performance of people. Ist may change the month(s) that people plan on having their babies born.,5
"Ugh, Malcolm Gladwell *slow claps*. You’ve done it again, sir. You’ve done it again. And a million thanks for performing the book yourself. I don’t think anyone else would have done it justice.",5
I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising account and very well researched. I like that he looked at things from a completely unique perspective. It certainly gave me some new ideas to think about. Putting a little more effort in studying and learning more about my profession is one of the things that I certainly took from this book. Sometimes all you need is a good book to remind us that we need to step up our game!,4
"This isn't a new story for scholars, but it is a great presentation of it.. There is plenty of research in the field of resiliency that tells us that children who survive and thrive despite extraordinary difficulties do so because of some element in their external environment that worked in their favor. The disappointment: super heroes they are not. The good news: average people can step in and make a difference. Very good news indeed. While scholars might not find much meat to chew on here, anyone outside the field will love it. And it reinforces my belief that all scholarly topics should be edited by a top journalist - hate to say it (sorry to my people!) but for enjoyment's sake, I much prefer reading a journalist's book on a scholarly topic than a academic's book. Gladwell's a great writer, and unless this is your field, you're not only going to enjoy reading the book, you'll learn a lot too!",4
"So interesting, it could be a novel. Outliers is a must read for anyone who enjoys outside the box material. It certainly makes you think. After I finished it, I spoke for 2 hours with the friend who recommended it. I finished it in 2 days with a pencil in my hand so I could underline parts that I felt I had to remember. Even though Outliers is a stimulating, thought provoking work, you don't have to be a doctoral candidate in philosophy to understand what Gladwell is saying. He's not trying to show the reader how ""deep"" he can be, he just makes his points clearly & distinctly.",5
"How success comes to many. As a very careful book reader, meaning many books are loaded with wasteful words and ideas. This one clearly is one of value, with research, thought and universal principles for becoming an outlier. I am happy to add this book to my shelf.",5
"The Unexpected Ingredients of Success. Success can often be related to something other than being the smartest or the best at something, it may have often to due with when you are born in a year or at a time in history. Gladwell makes those points in this work, while it is not an exhaustive look at success, it does point out some of the less known factors that contribute to ones success.",4
"Hard work and focus actually mean something. I recently heard the saying that it takes 10,000 hours of work and study to become an reasonable expert. I had become frustrated by people who think that a few hours of searching Google is somehow equivalent to a Ph.D. or MD. Or how Canadian hockey players are better when they're born during certain times of the year.",5
"Very interesting and motivating! Quick read.. Malcolm Gladwell's perspective is quite interesting and his book is quite entertaining. You read it and think ""why didn't I think this, it's a logical hypothesis""? The basis for this book seems so simple and yet it's so unique. So many stories of whom we consider ""sucessful"" people and how they became these icons boiled down to hard work and timing. It reinforces that hard work and dedication are important.",5
Worthless. Bad pages quality. Looks like first copy. Disappointed.,1
"Five Stars. Great book, arrived in great condition.",5
"Yet another good book from Malcolm Gladwell!. It is commonly believed that people become successful after ""working hard"" for a long time and then success happens! Although hard work is a success factor, there are many other variables that have much more influence on success. Gladwell presents real life stories and much background to demonstrate that success mostly come from factors such as: when someone is born, their ""ethnicity"", their family heritage, their geographic location, and circumstances (i.e. luck). Some or all of these factors combined with hard work made individuals or groups of people highly successful. His examples are great and support his key message.",4
This is such a great book. I had to read it for a .... This is such a great book. I had to read it for a class but I enjoyed it tremendously. Gladwell has a very out of the box unique perspective on things. When you read is correlations to cause your just like wow. He leaves you floored. I've heard of his other works and I'm told they have a very similar approach.,5
"Good writers are philosophers but in a really great book .... Good writers are philosophers but in a really great book the philosophy is shown, not told in large dollops. A moderately interesting read if you can overlook that all characters sound basically the same. Anne",3
"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",3
"Amazing!!. I loved this book. I highly recommend it, worth reading for sure. Great narration by the author as well.",5
Those who think they are outliers should read this. Ought to be required reading for every Prep Boarding School.,4
"Cool, cool (but...). This is another Gladwell's cool book. I've read the all and they all are very enjoyable and fun to read. The missing star is because I found as if Mr. Gladwell is repeating himself. The collection of clever ideas and unusual data has become Mr. Gladwell's trademark. But in his previous books everything was based upon some powerful insights. According to my taste the basic premise behind Outliers is not as powerful as the other two.",4
"I never knew.... Never judge a book by its covers, especially when it doesn't have a cover (read it on my Kindle). I read this book with never knowing that hard work could breed success. The 10,000 hour rule that was mentioned was very profound and devastating. I am a professional in the medical field, and after reading this book I no longer feel that it's ethical for me to continue practicing. I hope to one day practice again, but I want to wait until I've got a little more practice under my belt (8200 hours to go).",5
Well worth reading. It not only informs it motivates .... Well worth reading. It not only informs it motivates. Malcolm Gladwell communicates ideas clearly and uses data in accessible way for readers to understand.,5
"Fair perspective backed with solid research. Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting guy. This book was an easy read, and worthwhile. While I believe the author overempathsizes the effects of privilage and background, I think his nase perspective that these are contributors to success is valid. Good book for anyone who leans right to read and openly consider.",5
Outliers allows us to take a deeper look at the ingredients of success. In outliers we are exposed to the various factors that have contributed to the successes of a diverse set of individuals. It highlights the fact that no one is successful solely on the basis of their own work or talent. It exposes the true story behind success.,5
Brilliant examples - would love more obscure ones too. All of the examples were eye opening and yet oddly predictable. The way he wrote was addicting and easy to digest. I would love a book by him on agriculture and farmers/ farmer suicides.,4
Gladwell The Outlier. not difficult to understand why Malcolm Gladwell is one of this generation's leading thinkers. His perspective thorough research and elaborate storytelling give us insight into some of our commonly-held conventions. this is a great read.,5
"Amazing Book. Just like all of Mr. Gladwell's books, this was another hit. Well written and very inspiring and educational this makes you compare yourself against siblings, friends and co-workers. Just like all of this other books, they provide a thorough look into something that you may have overlooked.",5
Best read ever. Extremely grateful to the author for this wonderful book,5
"Thought provoking. This is one of those books that at least five people tell you to read and you don't until years later, then you realize it's brilliant.",4
"Five Stars. the book I've been waiting for...it's not just your ability, it's also your timing",5
"A book packed with interesting and unusual information. After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.",5
Three Stars. Read for school about success puts different perspective on success!,3
"Outliers by Gladwell. This book sparked a very interesting discussion with a book group about the concept of an outlier. While Gladwell's information was interesting, it seemed to most of us to represent fairly common sense. However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it. Gladwell's book seemed narrow with respect to being almost exclusively American in nature and ignored so many that were in other places in the world and other times in history.",5
So Intruiging. This book paints such a unique picture of many familiar success stories. really it made me think,5
got it for my daughter no complants. got it for my daughter no complants,5
"This book will stick with me.... I was fortunate to hear Malcolm Gladwell speak recently while at a conference. I had never read one of his books but after that conference I could not wait to do so. I decided to start with this book because my 16 year old son is required to read for his Junior Honors English class in high school (summer reading). I thought it would be a good book to discuss together. Was I right! He liked it just as much as I did. And, he is a hockey player born in August...this book really hit home for him and now has the reason why he will never be a professional hockey player in the NHL:)",5
"Excellent - It will make you think.. This book is different from the type of book I usually read but I really enjoyed the book. Outliers is a book about the reasons some people are successful in life or not successful. The date when a person is born, the 10,000 hour rule, Jewish lawyers and their success in the 70's and 80's, air plane pilots and the country in which they were born are all some of the outliers which the author discusses in full. What the book really does is make you look at your own life and wonder how your successes and failures are tied to things in which you had no control. I strongly urge everyone to read this book. It will keep your interest and make you think.",5
Five Stars. good,5
There are great insights in this book. Very worth reading. There are great insights in this book.,5
Malcolm Gladwell. A very deep book with much meaning that could be of use in the past,5
I especially enjoy the way Gladwell will present both the good and .... I can't ever say enough about Malcolm Gladwell. His books are always thoughtful and well laid out.,5
Five Stars. Item arrived as described. Fast shipping.,5
One of a Kind. Malcolm Gladwell has established a reputation as one of the signature writers of this generation; with good reason. Outliers is the third of his groundbreaking takes on a facet of modern life. His premise is that chance and opportunity play a much larger part in success than anyone cares to admit. He uses examples varying from teenage hockey players in Canada and teenage soccer players from Europe to Bill Gates and Bill Joy. The number of the richest people in the world born during the same decade in the same country. Why are some people able to find success in certain eras. Why some can't in others. This is a seminal work by a great writer with a great mind. I have recommended the book to many others. I do the same for the audiobook.,5
Interesting and inspiring. Interesting to think about these examples. Find something you enjoy in life and dont stress too much about making it,5
Five Stars. Right on time. 5/5,5
Five Stars. incredible!,5
BRILLIANT. This is one of the best listens you can have in your library!! He's done it again.,5
Started off great then fell off a bit. Book started off great then fell off a bit. The first 150 pages or so was about relatable topics then it got into stuff that I didn't really care about. Very interesting premise and I will read Gladwell's other books.,4
"The Chicken or the Egg. Life is unfair. Yes, different opportunities face all of us. However, and this is what the book seems to ignore, it is up to the individual to recognize and act. So, I don't believe it is the opportunity that make an outlier, it is the recognition of the opportunities, vision, desire, determination and action that produced the likes of Bill Gates. Keep in mind Bill Gates went to middle school with 300 other kids who all had the same access to the computer. So didn't all 300 have the same opportunity?",2
Five Stars. It is excellent with a wealth of unexpected observations.,5
Great book!!. This is such an interesting book. Malcolm Gladwell is very well versed in the subject and presents it in an easy to read manner.,5
"Thesis is backwards - missed the point. It was a worthwhile read despite the fact that is it essentially a collage of stories with somewhat of a common thread. The section on pilot error really openend my eyes to what happens in the cockpit of commercial airplanes. He writes in a style that entertains and informs, however it is far from a fully researched and logically presented subject. In school terms it would the an incomplete or fail. Not a pass grade. However, for TV attention span America it will do the trick.",3
"Makes you think!!!. Outliers made me think about my own past. He makes some good points about how certain systems we have in society effect us more than we realize. For instance, the location of our schooling and the age cut off dates when we began school might have caused a beneficial trend or the opposite in our life. These little advantages help to shape our growth within these systems more that we might realize. On the surface these truths may seem obvious but he goes into some detail about how it all plays out and that's pretty interesting.",5
"interesting concepts. Interesting concepts, good ideas but I felt it lacked a central theme.",4
Great book written by a great author. The book provides a detailed review of success and the lives of many successful people in modern history. It is an eye opening book. You enjoy ready this extremely well-written book and you learn a lot too.,5
"3rd time I read/ listened to this.. great material. my only issue with it is the fact that even if the greatest, rarest opportunities and circumstances become available to someone very few will run with them and stick to it for at least 10000hrs. that's the critical component that's lacking in this book.",4
"Outliers: story of success books. Haven’t finished the book yet but it is quite interesting however, it’s statistics is quite confusing and not for the laymen",3
"Fascinating book!. Malcolm Gladwell is a terrific storyteller, even though he writes non-fiction. Outliers blew me away (as is usual with ALL of Mr. Gladwell's writing) and it gave me much to consider whenever I feel inclined to whine about some famous person's ""lucky break""...! Outliers shows that success is only about 1 part lucky break, mixed with 9 parts sheer, gut-wrenching work. Just a fascinating piece of work.",5
excellent book. Logical and engaging walkthrough of facts about successful people over the last few hundred years. Started devolving into feelings and hearsay in the last chapters.,4
Four Stars. Thanx,4
"Great Book: Highly Recommended. My father had bought this book a few months ago and he recently recommended it to me. From first glancing at the cover, I was not very interested. I suspected the book would be a dull self-help book filled with tips on how to get rich and successful. To my immense delight, Outliers is far from a how-to manual. Malcolm Gladwell does not attempt to instruct his readers. Rather, he tries his best to explain why the common perception of successful people is severely flawed. People think that successful billionaires like Bill Gates achieved their triumphs single-handedly. Gladwell forces you, the reader, to delve far beyond their own personal efforts and skills; to look at the bigger picture. Gates, for example, was born in the perfect year. He was neither too young nor too old when he got into computer programming for him to be successful. Growing up in a wealthy household, Gates had the necessary resources. Additionally, he got unlimited access to the computers at the University of Washington when he was in college; He had far more programming experience than his peers of similar intelligence. Gladwell pulls out these seemingly insignificant factors but makes you believe that they, not his genius, are the reasons for his success. Among explanations for successful businessmen, Gladwell manages to throw in some really interesting observations. For instance, professional hockey players are predominantly born in January and Asian airline pilots are more likely to crash than American pilots. He emphasizes the influence of upbringing and cultural background when looking at success. The author relates the Chinese tradition of cultivating rice paddies with Chinese superiority in math. Though these claims can sound ridiculous, Gladwell elaborately explains his reasoning until it actually starts to make sense. Gladwell has a writing style that draws the audience in. I would highly recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell to anyone who possesses an open mind; anyone prepared to view success in a whole new light.",5
Great book. Suberb writing,5
"Taking the mystery out of Outliers. I've seen Malcom Gladwell speak twice and read both ""Tipping Point"" and ""Blink,"" which I really enjoyed but ""Outliers"" is his crowning work. The book is written in an organized way yet displays profound out the box thinking. Many of us like to think of our heros as truely exceptional people but Mr. Gladwell shows us in his book that many times it's taking what's been given to us, practicing, and being in the right place at the right time. I enjoyed the entire book but what most impressed me was his personal tale about himself, his mother, and grandmother and how being an Outlier has more to do with what went before us then what we actually were able to do ourselves. I liked how the book made me think about how even if I wasn't an Outlier that by me providing opportunities as a teacher or a parent that I may help a future Outlier.",5
Super fascinating. I may have experienced the largest single paradigm shift reading this book than any other I’ve read a single time.,5
outliers. truly one of the best audio books of the year,5
Different!. Show me a point of view that I havent realized.,4
"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",4
does not disappoint. loved it,5
A richer perspective. A wonderfully constructed context of success that gives you a new perspective on success of others and yourself!,5
"Gladwell does it again. I have read all of Malcom Galdwell's books. They are fascinating and engaging. His books are a series of different stories with a similar theme. I learned a LOT from his latest book ""The Outliers."" It contains secrets to success that actually make sense - the 10,000-hour rule was eye-opening. Wait until you read about WHY the best hockey players in Canada usually were born in the first three months of year.",4
"Amazing. Upon nearly every page turn, I found myself thinking or even saying aloud, “this is amazing.” I haven’t been this enthusiastic about awarding a 5-star review in a long time. When I have more time, I hope to revise and make this a more substantive review. I wish I’d read this 10 years ago.",5
Nice Book. Everything fine just didn't liked the cover it is removable.,4
"fascinating!. a fascinating look at the factors that influence the success of those who have achieved much in the world. inspiring for everyone to put in a lot of hard work, effort, and determination in order to make the world a better place!",5
Wonderful. Page quality ist good. Pages are too yellow .,4
"Great way to think. Chances, opportunities, work, and sometimes luck plays the outcome over skill and greatness. Would suggest to see some different ways to see past success stories.",5
"Good read. This is an interesting book. It seems to be well researched and the referenced studies are incorporated into the text very naturally. It's not a difficult book to read, and if you had a long journey coming up I'd recommend this book as a travel companion.",4
"A fun read until about half way. I really enjoyed parts of the book. However, there were. Few chapters that completely lost my attention. Almost overly focused in that the underlying point was unclear until clarified later.",3
"Interesting Read. Very entertaining read. Read it all on a 5 hour flight. I would recommend for those looking for a quick read. The main theme of the book is opportunity (which apparently, we as individuals have no control over) meets preparation and hard work.",4
Five Stars. GREAT BOOK!,5
Great Book. Great Book! I bought it for me and my girlfriend and we got a lot out of it. Great stories of journeys to success.,5
"Five Stars. Great book, filled with all sorts if interesting facts.",5
Spot On. Gladwell reiterates what we know already. In such an eloquent manner! Intelligence paired with the right resources gets you to where you need to be. To be that outlier who gets the world’s attention,5
"Do you think intelligence and hard work lead to high success? Think again.. It takes more than intellect and dilligence to get to the top. Gladwell uses interesting case histories to illustrate factors we seldom think about as leading persons to become exceptionally successful. His research is interesting, almost exciting. It may even get you to think about why you are as you are, although that is probably not his objective. Well written, easy to read even as complex and diverse subject areas are discussed.",5
"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",4
Good book. Enjoyable read. More focus on luck than I expected. You can only be great at something if you both get lucky and try hard.,4
A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,4
Thought Provoking. So good I had to read it twice!!!,5
"The question is ""Why."". Outliers is about the details that create outliers. Step inside the lives of the stories and in the end wish to recreate the circumstances which drive success.",5
"Couldn't put it down. An easy, but thought provoking read. I will never look at US education and arbitrary entry to scholastic and athletic endeavors the same way.",5
"Three Stars. The more I learn about Gladwell, the less I appreciate and respect his work.",3
Great book. Great book that shows how people excel,5
"Are you an outlier? Read this to find out!. This is a very interesting read. His perspectives about when and where you were born are fascinating. Practice and hard work are very important to succeed in life, but the luck of your heritage play a much larger part than most would believe. Malcolm Gladwell's own story is proof of this.",5
"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",4
"Fascinating and thought-provoking.. While reading this book, I have recounted different parts of it to at least ten people. It just makes my mind whirl. Also it is just a fun read, very clear conversational in style.",5
"meh.. An easy read by Gladwell, recognizing that no human is self made, particularly no ""genius."" Culture, luck, heritage and class all play a role in successes and failures.",3
Five Stars. Quality book,5
I really enjoyed Outliers. I enjoyed and learned a lot from Outliers. I too am interested in many of the great people mentioned in this book. I question their success not in a negative way but exactly in the way that Malcolm explains. It was nice to learn how just the right amount of occurrences and in a certain order leads to the ultimate outlier. It makes sense and history shows it.,5
Love Gladwell's books. Outliers is a fascinating story of genius. No one gets there alone. He's one of the best thinkers out there. I just purchased David and Goliath for another great read. When you find an author like this you want to keep going and read everything they have to offer.,5
Terrific. Are u ready to invest 10000 hrs of your time to become perfect.,5
Outliers Review - Tolson. have not finished the book yet but i hear it is one of the greatest books ever written!,5

"free state books US is a good distributor. free state books US is a good distributor: got my copy w very little markings, only signs of age, air exposure to the pages i bet. it had been in a library.",5
Five Stars. Great book. Discusses successful people and the affect their family and opportunities helps them along the way.,5
One of my recent favorites.. I’ve gifted this book to at least 10 people. I just can’t say enough nice things about the book or Malcolm Gladwell. It’s a joy to have your perceptions realigned this late in life - but not easy. Gladwell does an amazing job of making you reanalyze the way you think.,5
"Interesting look at environmental factors in success. Interesting book, especially when read in connection with Mlodinov's ""Drunkard's Walk."" I'm not sure about the author's conclusions regarding education, but found his thesis regarding environmental factors as an influence on success as quite convincing.",4
Five Stars. Great reading.,5
"One of the most fascinating reads ever. Unless your offended by being called a *#&5*#$%.. fascinating book. As a southerner, though, I, too, would want to fight any jerk who called me what provoked southerners in a test that Gladwell writes about. Wish he would get the guts or whatever, to do the same instead of telling us southerner to adjust our behavior. Never be a gimp and tell someone how to act!",5
Instant Fascination. Just received today and sped through the first 10% already! Fascinating read that changes how you view the world in less than 30 pages.,5
Book Printing Defective - Blank or partially blank pages. I'm giving this a one-star as the product is defective.,1
Great book!. GREAT BOOK! A must read for everyone.,4
Very interesting and informative. This book pointed out many interesting study results.,5
Success is a mixture. The myth of success holds us back. We need to acknowledge that a little bit of luck and circumstance do play a role but we also must take advantage of all the chances we are afforded.,5
Great book. I have heard lots of people quote the book so great to listen and get it,5
A Very Iteresting read. This was probably my most interesting reads for the whole,5
Gift for a friend. They enjoyed it thoroughly.,5
Excellent write up. Wonderful narration and write up by the author. He has gathered loads of information from various books & psychological surveys. Planning to buy some of his other books as well. Would suggest this book for my friends.,5
"Thought-provoking. This book reminded me quite a bit of David and Goliath, which is the first Gladwell book I read. Sometimes the conclusions feel oversimplified or even far-fetched, but the book certainly is though-provoking. I enjoyed it especially because the stories made me reflect on my own life, legacy and community so I could more clearly see why I am who I am and where I am going.",4
"Circumstance, Work, inheritance. Are outliers really so special? Where do they come from and why? Are they actually as special as we are led the believe? Is the conventional narrative really telling us the whole story?",5
love malcolm & his story. this should be required reading. nit sure for what level of school but early...awesome to understand these concepts,5
great book. Great perspective on success . I would recommend this book to anyone looking to discover new ways to take charge of their success.,5
They are lucky. Luck accounts for 90% of success.,4
It's a good read. Gives insight to most famous people in world and Chance they got.,4
Five Stars. fantastic brilliant amazing superb good,5
Outerliers a book every Data Analyst should read. This book was truly amazing! It really made you think and see things in a totally different light. Too bad all don't read this and think more about it! Life as we know it might look a little different! Loved the book!!! Would highly recommend!,5
good book. I am about 1/3 the way through the book an dit is a very interesting read so far. Looking forward to the rest.,3
"Great listen. I love listening to Malcolm Gladwell books for the same reasons most people do. At the risk of sounding picky or blind to the fact that this is a great book, I don't think it's Gladwell's best. The Tipping Point and David & Goliath both had an amazing stickiness for me, where it's been a over week since finishing this and haven't been thinking about it as much. I STILL think about The Tipping Point all the time.",4
"My 16 year old loves it!. My daughter needed this book for her AP English language class in school. However, she has read it several times, and told me how much she enjoys the book. Win/win!",5
"Easy read!. Easy read, you can get through a lot of it in one sitting. Although I love the book, I still have the last quarter I have to read...however, the first 3 sections of the book inspired me so much that I don't see why I should finish the book.........not sure if anyone else has experienced this. I just don't know what else this book can offer me. This has happened to me with two other books written by Malcolm Gladwell.... in the next year or two, I'll eventually get to reading those last pages... good book overall",5
Very enjoyable educational read. Very enjoyable approach to an intelligent evaluation of the variables in any system.,5
"Wow!. This book was something else. Not only was it entertaining and fun to listen to, but it gave me a greater understanding of why people are simply great. Would 12/10 suggest this book to anyone who wants to listen to this on a long car ride or working out at the gym!",5
"The evolution of Good to Great. This is purely masterful and exceedingly encouraging. Though Malcolm Gladwell clearly points out the advantages of right timing and societal advantages, one refrain remains constant and that is the willingness of those Outliers to work really hard. The example between high IQ and ""applied"" high IQ paints a telling picture. If you've read Jim Collins' Good to Great, Outliers will come as a worthy sequel that ties it all together and propels this quantitative analysis further ahead.",5
"Couldn't put it down. An easy, but thought provoking read. I will never look at US education and arbitrary entry to scholastic and athletic endeavors the same way.",5
"Outliers-Stories of Success and Circumstance. Shockingly success may be less random than it seems. Being born right may have more to do with your future success than hard work and grit. Still, there is something to be said for being ready and able to meet opportunity, but it seems that opportunity may be best taken advantage of by the right people who are the right age at the right place at the right time.",5
Great product! Super fast shipping!. Great product! Super fast shipping!,5
Highlighted the importance of a good Community. Facts. Stats. Stories. And great analogies. Each chapter/section pretty much explores different fields or areas of life. And makes are strong case for asking why more isn't being done to ensure as many people as possible are giving the same opportunities as the best group of performers.,5
best book by MG. Easley his best work so far. have never realized how many factors are at play to make people successful.,5
Very eye opening. Very good,4
"Great read that reviews a lot of Outliers and how they became such.. This was a fantastic read. It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing. Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing. Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.",4
"Fascinating theories. This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make ""greats"" great. The stories are fascinating, and worth a read. Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end. That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off. I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.",4
"Robin's ""Outliers"" Review. ""Outliers"" is a thought provoking book discussing the events and environments that came together to give certain people the opportunity to be big successes, ie, the Bill Gates and Beatles of the world. It also discusses the reason why other people that should have been huge successes did not reach there potential.",4
"Inspiring Illustrations. Obviously Gladwell is a great writer. He is fully gifted at turning dry data over the good storytelling. With inspiring illustrations of interesting research I found kinship with some interesting people, even if I fall short of their greatness. At least there is reason not to always comply with the status quo.",5
Great book. Great read and quite engaging too. Some things which are taken for granted can be quite meaningful when looked at in depth.,5
"Interesting but repetitive. This book was recommended to me by a friend, but it wasn't full of inspirational stories of success like I was expecting, rather talking about how people's successes are more a result of the opportunities they have been given. Contained interesting accounts of black box recordings though.",3
"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success. The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom. The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? n ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",4
Ok. Okay,4
"This book is fantastic. I am a big fan of business literature and have read books by authors such as Jim Collins, Dale Carnegie and more.",5
"Interesting. Love the book. Fascinating from cover to cover. Makes me rethink a few things. Luck is a big contributor to success. Turns out 10,000 hours and a number of other things, even going back generations and culture are also at work. Loved it.",5
"Outliers: The Story of Success. An excellent study of why certain people or groups achieve success. When they are born, the 10,000 hour rule, etc. etc.",5
"Easy and fun. Loved al the stories in this book, especially about the Beatles, Bill Gates and professional hockey. But what sticks is the detailed research and insight into why these people are so successful. Malcolm's prose and story telling makes the pages turn quickly. I also enjoyed the chapters about his family and himself (interview).",5
"What month were you born ? -a surprising analysis of high achievers. Malcolm Gladwell has taken a remarkably broad approach to try to identify if there any factors in common between 'OUTLIERS' - people whose achievements lie well beyond the normal range. His studies are as diverse as Mozart, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. He looks at football teams and ""geniuses"". His conclusions are unexpected but compelling - lateral thinking which surprises and entertains. I couldn't stop quoting bits and recommending this book to all my friends - it may not change your life but it will give you a new insight into some possible precursors for outstanding achievement. It's an easy read - I really couldn't put it down!",5
"Another win for Gladwell. Bought this for a Psychology class, but it was a wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Having read The Tipping Point, I was familiar with Gladwell and his style, which I love. He writes at a level which is understandable for the general population. The book is well researched and each example of an outlier really makes you think differently about this concept of success.",5
Loved it!. Life changer! Loved it!,5
"Impressive!. Thought it was a used book, and when it arrived, it was packaged as new! So I was very satisfied with my purchase!",5
Great reas. I found this to be one of the best reads I've read in years. It's a good book with a lot of substance. Gladwell writes in a very simple style that is entertaining as well as very thought provoking.,4
Five Stars. Be inspired and read this book.,5
Five Stars. GREAT BOOK!,5
"Nice reminder, too narrow.. Outliers: the one sided story of success.",4
Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable. I found myself repeating much of his findings and points in everyday conversation about success. Highly recommend and am continuing to read more by him.,5
Amazing. Was a great product was a big plus for my gym experience if you buy would like me to try any more prouducts and give you reviews on instagram or YouTube I can help you out with that. @Albertom5969 or amateos@ycp.edu,5
Everyone should read this. Loved this book. Should be required reading for all.,5
"Changes the way you look at success.. Nice to see some scientific research on what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours of practice is the key.",4
"It Makes Sense. Gladwell has statistics that make sense about how achievement happens. It really is much about effort and hard work, though!",4
"I¿m a big fan of Gladwell¿s books, and Outliers has not disappoi. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s books, and Outliers has not disappointed.  It follows in the steps of his other books, illustrating interesting social phenomena in a way that is compelling.  I found the book fascinating and difficult to put down, and especially loved the focus on the fact that we tend to look at success far to simplistically and prefer to congratulate ourselves for achieving success with &amp;ldquo;hard work&amp;rdquo; rather than being thankful for the circumstances that led to the success.",5
"Remarkable Work. Extremely readable, relatable and thought-provoking. The message is enlightening and inspiring. I look forward to reading Gladwell's other books.",5
"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",4
"The autgot misses what his own data shows him. In my own personal experience, people that work really hard - not his pay lip service to it - are the rarest thing in our western society. While nobody denies that timing and place are critical, hard work is the difference. Leonardo Davincci conceived of the idea of a helicopter, but could not build one because he was so ahead of his time. Yet he would never have gone there except for his indomnitable spirit and hard work.",2
"New Way to think about things. Worth the pick. I did enjoy learning to see things through a different light. At the end of the day, achievement and success might not be as far fetched as it is made out to be.",4
"An insightful listen. I found the performance monotone. However, the material is worth the listen, or better yet, the read.",5
"Awesome book. Great book, really enjoyed the premise and the supporting stories! Gladwell makes the stories come to life!",5
Outliers book. Loved the book. I sent extra one to 16-year-old grandson and he loved it too. Now we spent time on phone discussing book. Love it!,5
Excellent. Everything is perfect!,5
"Lots of Liberal BS to sift, but still a must read!. There is a fair amount of liberal thinking garbage in the book that I had to cringe through, but if you keep an open eye to the deeper point of the book and take from it the facts to expand your mind, the book becomes a must read. In the end the message I decide to take and partly the message the author gives is, that we all for the most part live in a situation or world with unlimited possibilities. Yes some people had it a little easier, but ultimately your hard work and dedication to something will result in your success. Recognize your place and time in life and try to identify the leg up that's been offered to you. Exploit that through hard work and be a success!",5
Hgh. Vhhh,5
Great themes. Great themes yet I think this author could make the writing less extended,4
Great book on Success. I always recommend this book to everyone that asks about it! I read it in two days. Interesting and fun read with success stories!,5
"So interesting, reading it now!. I downloaded the book. . .first ever! Enjoying reading on the kindle. Only came across Gladwell recently but interesting guy!",5
"This was a great book to think outside of the box. This was a great book to think outside of the box. It makes me view the world in a completely different manner than I use to. It has made me reevaluate how I am raising my 3 years old daughter. She is thriving more than ever, since I have changed my parenting, because of this book.",5
great book with a lot of great information. while the story provides a great amount of information I feel that at times Gladwell dives a little more into the back story than needs he needs to.,4
"Very interesting and enjoyable to read.. I really enjoyed reading this book. Malcolm Gladwell includes many interesting case studies in this book, which are fascinating to read about. It is also very entertainingly written. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about what makes some people successful but not others.",5
Five Stars. Explained so much about life.,5
soooooo gooooood. this book will change your perspective on everything you achieve and educate you along the way,5
Excellent. Excellent book,5
Good. Good book,5
Five Stars. As advertised,5
Four Stars. Great,4
"I would rate this Best of Malcolm Gladwell's works. Gladwell provides a convincing argument that exceptionalism is a product of community, opportunity, timing, circumstance, and hard work. Something to keep in mind whenever we aspire for greatness",5
Interesting. Interesting data and helpful hints on life,4
Good buy. Quick delivery and good quality.,5
Great Book!. Another Christmas gift for my husband. (Thought it would motivate him!) He loved the book. Prompt delivery from this company!,5
"Excellent insights for another viewing of success. ""Success follows a predictable course.""",5
As always. Great listen as always! Very insightful and enlightening. Everyone in a while I listen to it again.,5
A New Take on Success. This book is the most fascinating I have read that looks at success from a different vantage point. Well researched he maintains his theme that success is not accidental or simply luck. This book should be on high school reading lists.,5
My first experience with Gladwell - Excellent!. I picked this title based on reviews I'd heard of Gladwell's work and wasn't disappointed. Found it to be insightful and thought provoking. A great book for those interested in the learning more about the 'secret to success'.,5
"English Teachers Don't Read Their Recommendations. Summer reading, once again demonstrating that those selecting summer reading spend less time selecting the material they inflict than actually thinking about their students needs. Of all the wonderful and thrilling reads available this pedantic piece of semi-scientific fluffery isn't worth the time or effort. Better off reading a textbook on statistics than dwelling on those living at the edge of the bell curve. Flip a coin, what's the chance it will land on its edge? That's the chance a High School student will have of enjoying this book.",2
interesting and thought provoking. This book offers a fascinating new perspective on success. Loved it. Gladwell's presentation of these ideas and his narration are wonderful.,5
Good for thought. Whether you subscribe to Gladwells way of thinking you have to value his creative thought processes. He turns the simple upside down and then presents it on the most logical narrative. I love the way he thinks and read all his books. It's good mental exercise.,5
It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Words won’t do justice to this book! It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s so informative and easy to read while packing in so much interesting information.,5
Good Book. U will get more experience in Life. U can learn how to start new things in ur life. Best Book for learners.,4
"but definitely a good read.. Hasn't made me a success yet, but definitely a good read.",5
"Importance of Outliers!. Fantastic read, insightful, informative and made me want to read more from Gladwell! Highly recommended",5
"Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books. This book was a phenomenal read - highly enjoyable, and it really made me think. Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books.",5
Five Stars. Very insightful.,5
Eye opening. This was an amazing explanation of,5
"Inspiring. I found this book extremely interesting - about how success is earned and not just for the fortunate few. Once I had stopped listening, I couldn't wait to pick up on it again.",4
"Ordering method. I knew that I had ordered twice by mistake. Right after I ordered second time, I tried to cancel it by sending email you. Failed. The email sent back to me. I tried to find out the right path to cancel it. Failed. I tried again the next day to find no way to cancel it. Days later, I recieved two items and I returned one item. Samuel Lee.",1
"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",4
"Perfect. Perfect……But I just started reading, why do you force me to write a comment? My friend recommend this book for me, and it seems it's an interesting book with very different views.",5
"Great book. Great book, easy to read, REALLY interesting. Bought this because I saw Gladwell's TED ""David and Goliath"" talk and decided to start out with this book before reading that one. It is very interesting and very easy to read, although there is an issue with the side notes and the e-version, so that detracted from the experience, but that's Amazon's fault, not the authors.",5
fascinating. A very interesting twist on the paths of success and how the external forces in our world have as much power as our own drive in achieving mastery.,5
Gladwell's finest work so far.. This is probably one of Gladwell's defining works. He digs into why the kind of success that creates what we perceive to be those outliers like Bill Gates is usually a whole lot more than just serendipity. Highly recommended. I'd argue that this work is as much a philosophical piece as it is scientific or business.,5
"One of the best secular books I've ever read. I am very thankful for this book. Since I have read it, I have recommended to many people to get their 10,000 hours in. It's amazing how hard work and amazing opportunities prove to make people into Outliers...",5
"Excellent and engaging. There is more hope for the humans in the world than I thought prior to reading this revealing and interesting book. Our group think needs to change for more people to rise in different fields. And I understand more how everything works together to make the exceptional human, not just a few minor things---along with at least 10,000 hours of practice. Makes me very glad for people who do not use early entrance to kindergarten, as I read like a teacher.",5
"Wow. I cannot say enough about this book. First, the stories are engaging and the logical thought process by the author and his arguments are very convincing. I find myself thinking of the book while watching the news on a daily basis! This book is that applicable to the real world. You start realizing how people became successful and you quickly realize characteristics that make people unsuccessful. All in all, a fascinating experience.",5
"What culture do you come from?. Interesting theories of how and why people succeed in different kinds of work. Much rings true to me, and the book made me think. It is well written.",5
"amazing info on this issue will surprise you!. What more can I say? Oh, brother now it tells me that I needed 15 more words for a review....",5
"Fascinating interpretation of success. Gladwell has an inviting style of writing. It's as though he's chatting with the reader, alone, over coffee. His unpretentious,natural manner is the antithesis of his extraordinary observations and insights. A great read .",5
"Good reading but 4 stars for 10k hour rule only. Excellent book, BUT remember the success is when you achieve what you want. Your legacy, genes, sex, gender, size are factors you should consider, but only the sky is the limit and your mind is your first obstacle. I disagree we some considerations from author about circumstantial conditions in advantage outliers have. I know people with nothing in his favor that have achieved success. The most important thing or concept is the 10k hrs rule 4 stars for that.",4
Inspirational. I really enjoyed this book and will purchase all Malcolm Gladwell's literary work.,5
hindi language. Provide hindi and english both language,4
"Good Read.. Good book to read but does that means if we are in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is not much chance for the rest of us!",4
Fascinating. A provocative look at success and how the most successful people in history rose to notoriety!,5
Five Stars. Good,5
Outliers helps to make sense of coincidences.. Very informational. As always!,5
The listen was as enjoyable as the read. Having read the book years ago I was obviously familiar with the book's content but having the author Malcom Gladwell actually read it out loud was so much more impact full and might I say intimate. really a fine demonstration of storytelling.,5
"Insightful, knowledgable and fun.. Brilliant book which really opened my eyes to how different factors other than so called ""pure genious"" can contribute to success. It was written in such a way that I didn't get bored and looked forward to reading it everyday.",5
I loved it. Haven't heard from the gift recipients what .... This was a gift. I loved it. Haven't heard from the gift recipients what they thought.,5
It will change the way you think.. Very few books in my life have actually changed my worldview. This is now on my list. Highly recommended.,5
Couldn't put it down!!!. Every review was accurate with 5 stars for this fascinating and captivating read!,5
"Interesting Read. Well worth the time, changes your perspective on the ""brilliants"" of the world. Would highly recommend to everyone. Five out of five.",5
"Finally, a case well made.... I have intuitively understood that there are many influences of success, but have never heard it explained so well and completely. I enjoyed the different stories and the similarities they share, explained masterfully. Well done Malcolm!",5
Classy product. The book was fantastic. And their weren't any problems with the delivery process,5
Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to .... Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?,5
"Interesting. Quick read, interesting facts. I guess I was looking for a little more self help information and it really didn't take into consideration personal motivation. Well written.",3
I AM IN LOVE with this book. I absolutely love this book. It makes so much sense. Common sense things that I know but it is explained so beautifully/ perfectly in this book. This is one of the greatest books of my life and I love reading it. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing it.,5
"Not Really About Outliers.. This books title leads you to believe that it's going to talk about statistical outliers, but it only nominally does that. Gladwell ignores actual outliers in the teeth of the statistical cases he presents.",1
"Great listen. Intriguing, interesting and fascinating! This books makes one aware of how important the environment, culture and timing is to a person's success. well put together , a must read/listen.",4
Rice Paddies. Find yourself in Outliers,5
"1st time Gladwell reader. Gladwell has a perfect grasp of statistical relevance. He is not quite as smart as Taleb, but then neither am I; LOL. You will find this book to be an easy and enjoyable read, and I especially recommend it for new parents. I have since purchased another book by this author.",5
Outstanding book and entertaining as well. What a delightful read! I really enjoyed Outliers. It not only shows what is important in terms of success and how we may use this knowledge to help more people become successful.,5
"So much insight!. Wow! Such a quich read, but so much thoughful, pertinent, temporal insight. It makes one reassess one's life story. A must read.",5
"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",4
"Five Stars. amazing read, everybody needs to read this book!",5
Great read!. Loved this book. Great insight!,5
"Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set .... Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set of evidence from different walks of life showing how we are conditioned by external circumstances. In the end still shows that talent and hard work still do matter - depending on circumstances you can get extraordinary results with what you get.",4
"Extremely boring!. I love reading, and I honestly tried my best but I simply couldn't finish this book! Gladwell goes on and on and spends full chapters saying something that could have been done in a paragraph... So many pointless things... I felt such a waste of my time trying to finish the book. If I could I would ask my money back!",1
"A book for everyone's shelf. Gladwell focusses on and explains the success of a series of significant figures from history and the present day, with penetrating clarity. A must-read",5
"Read like a bad doctoral dissertation. I have to preface this by saying I am a psychologist, and have taught psychology. This author's understanding of the value of both the Terman study and psychological testing is so poor, that it is clear that he only used this information to make his point. He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential. He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking. He needed to understand far more about what he was writing. I read this for a book club, and if this is their idea of important reading, then I'm going back to Danielle Steel, at least its escapist for an afternoon.",2
"If you like exploring phenomenon beyond their appearance and if you enjoy story-telling writings about factual subjects, here: success",3
"10,000 Hours for the price of a few.. Another way to read this book is, ""it's not me, it's all the people and connections I didn't make.""",5
"Luck or circumstances. Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.",4
"Five Stars. Engaging, insightful, thought provoking.",5
Amazing. Amazing quality. Amazing story.,5
"We can all be outliers and this book explains how!. What is an Outlier? How do people become outstanding in their field? Are the born with a skill? Do you have to learn a skill? Do you have to be born at the right time? Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”? The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time. Were they the brightest or the best? As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",5
Five Stars. A very interesting book really enjoyed it. Highly recommend it.,5
"Fascinating read with minor flaws. I seem to agree with Gladwell with the conclusion he makes. The arguments are sound but they do look to be cherry picked at times. This was probably the main flaw for me, and some people also tend to be highly critical of the book for this reason. It also seems to be repetitive at times. Again, these are only very minor flaws in otherwise excellent book. But still a very fascinating read and presents alternative perspective. Very easy to read, probably a must read for most people.",5
"Success looks very different to me now.. I find myself wondering how a life might be different every time I encounter someone with ability or passion that is untapped, if only they had been exposed to a wider range of opportunities.",4
"Great book, good price. Great book, good price",5
"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",4
Worth the read. All of Gladwell's books are thought provoking and insightful. Highly recommend.,5
The book is original copy. The font size is bit small,4
"Very interesting, makes me think about doing things differently for my children. This book makes you think about what it takes to be an ""outlier"". It isn't all brains and charisma. Very interesting book with many real world examples of success and a detailed breakdown of how it was achieved.",4
Fantastically interesting and compelling book. I originally purchased the audible version of this book but I found it so compelling that I purchased a hard copy as well. It's easy to read and relevant to anyone. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
"Great insight, fun to read. I like Gladwell’s way of putting data and insights together, but in a fun and easy way. Read Blink and this. Will move to the next.",4
It fell short of my expectations. Found it abrupt .... It fell short of my expectations. Found it abrupt and the dots did not connect so well as expected. My perception ....,2
"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2
"A Different Perspective on the Nature of Success. I have read both of Gladwell's previous books, and this one is another fascinating achievement. The book reads much like his other books, Blink and The Tipping Point, with some overarching themes and a lot of interesting examples, data, and narratives.",5
"Is your future already decided?. In Malcolm Gladwell's third book, Outliers he looks at why there are people who are outside the normal population, those who excel, he investigates why these people are so great.",5
"The Outliers. The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called ""Skillful Teaching""....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster. I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field. Not difficult or technical in the least :-)",4
"The good and the bad. Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.",3
"Fiction. The ""Story"" of Success is a good title. There is a great deal of ""storytelling"" done in the book. Mr. Gladwell attempts to strictly correlate success and circumstance. If you weren't born at the right time, or if you did not have unfettered access to some new whiz bang phenomenon or if you didn't have the right heritage or the right group of friends, than the mediocrity of your performance is not your fault. A grand example of when correlation does not equal causation.",1
"1/3 of the way in... Lives up to the reputation!. 1/3 of the way through the book, and it's awesome. Can't wait to keep reading! So insightful; I've found myself implementing some of the concepts in my life already.",5
Phenomenal book!!!. Another example of Malcolm's genius! He always has such interesting perspectives based on impressive research.,5
Outstanding. This is my second book I've listened to by Malcolm gladwell and it's certainly doesn't disappoint! I highly recommend this book as it will open your understanding of the interdependencies that success is built upon.,5
"A mesmerising read, from beginning to end.. This book is incredible. It's insights are fascinating and challenging. Gladwell puts his point across so clearly and methodically, with humour and great storytelling along the way.",5
"Fantastic Content.. Loved it, really opened my eyes and mind to why certain things are, a must.",5
"Good book. I enjoyed this book, but got lost a few times with all of the statistics. :) I'm glad I was able to stick it out, because it does have some great information on what it takes to be an outlier.",4
"Kids: do not be discouraged. Just work hard.. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell shows the intriguing correlation between culture (many generations back), opportunity, and chance and the achievement of successful people. The author discusses Scottish herdsmen from the borderlands and the legacy that leaves with the (often mistakenly derided) honor among Southerners. He discusses generations of hard work by Chinese rice farmers and how that, plus basic constructs of their language, profoundly impact the math abilities of Asians today. As an individual, I appreciate more my (Scottish/Irish) tenant farmer heritage and the role that the ethos of hard work played in my own personal success. I also see how my early math geek experiences (mental math competitions) gave me an advantage in engineering school.",3
"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book. Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",3
"LADY LUCK in YOUR LIFE!. Absolutely fascinating ... goes to prove that LUCK, from birth date, year, environment (family and economy and climate) and technology (all or some of the above) play a huge role in how successful a person becomes!",5
Fascinating study of the various causes of success. Outliers is a fascinating book. The people you are introduced to by Malcolm Gladwell and the remarkable events that create the environments that result in their success or failure are amazing to comprehend. It also helps that outliers is quite well written too.,5
One Star. not bad,1
"Great Read. I bought this book because it was recommended by my guitar teacher. I haven't finished it but it is very intriguing even if it shows me that I will probably never be a Jimmy Hendrix. : ) It is excellent in quality and the price was great, too.",5
"Not a self-help book. Story jumped from random study to random study, without cohesive thought. The conclusion wise you are a product of your environment and experiences, Plus the work you put into it. Nothing really tangible that you could grab a hold of to make you a better person.definitely not a self-help book.",3
Five Stars. easy read!,5
good product. came clean. no damage.,5
"Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on .... Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on LUCK! This book has changed my world! As a hard worker, there were times when I didn't understand why my hard work didn't produce success, or that it would take so long to see results...but now I understand very clearly that sometimes it's just a matter of waiting for LUCK to show up and being prepared when it does!",5
Great book. This is one of the only books i have read with so much intrigue that I have actually come to finish. Well recommended!,5
"Excellent Read, Freshman-College level required reading. Have you ever wondered why some people make it and some people don't? Malcolm Gladwell exams this question through interviews with many persons",5
"Great book! Discusses how some of the most successful .... Great book! Discusses how some of the most successful people got were they got due to what they had access to, who they knew, and being at the right place at the right time.",5
What's the point?. I couldn't get the point of the whole idea of the book? shall the football players not been born in Jan stop playing just because they born in the wring date. I believe the book could be more of small talks not a book. The only reason I completed this book is to understand what's the author is trying to prove.,3
"Loved it !!!!. I enjoyed every minute of it. No, actually every second of it. The performance of Malcolm Gladwell as a narrator was brilliant. There is something in his voice that made listening to this book a mesmerizing experience. The book itself was brilliant as well. I learned so much. I absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to know what makes successful people successful. How opportunity and cultural legacy plays an important role in our life and dictates what we become.",5
"Oh, so THAT's the reason.... What an interesting read, overloaded with tons of fabulous connections and hypotheses about how and why the successful seem to go so far so fast.",5
"Amazingly insightful. Just a remarkable book. Well researched and written, Gladwell makes you feel as though you are finding the answers to these questions and learning together. Highly recommend.",5
Excellent!. Enlightening perspective by one of the great psychological minds of our generation. Every bit as good as “the tipping point”,5
"Terrific Read!. Gladwell does a remarkable job of connecting ideas that, at first glance, seem utterly unrelated. Step by step, Gladwell brilliantly dissects societal patterns to explain why various individuals were outliers in history. This book causes one to reflect on all the incredible opportunities and people in ones own story.",5
Wow!. I don't think i will look at the woeld in the same way ever again!,5
Good. Personally I did not like this book much. The author did not mention that success depends on Karma. Bill gate was born that time because of his good karma and his life purpose. I born now as per my karma and life purpose.,3
Five Stars. Awesome book. Must read!,5
"Seeing things from a different prospective. This book shows behind essences about what really means for someone to become successful. Reinforcing that by no means successful people come out the blue, neither they fit the typical stereotype where they must come from rich or smart families.",5
"Interesting concepts. 10, 000 hours, honor, .... Interesting concepts. 10,000 hours, honor, gives a different view of human behavior.",4
"Eye-opening patterns. This book was a complete eye opener and not in just one way, but many! The different patterns that made outliers who they are today are remarkable and outstanding all to see that you are an outlier too.",5
Success is sometimes being in the right place with the right skill set.. well written with a very interesting angle. Enjoyed it.,5
Three Stars. OK,3
"Insightful book. This book is well researched and elucidates with scientific studies and excellent prose one of the fundamental mysteries about human beings: how come we are all born the same, 2 arms, 2 legs, one brain etc. and yet we end up being so different. Brilliant.",5
"good. condition as stated, good value",5
"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",5
"I didn't like this book very much.  I didn't like the way it was. I didn't like this book very much.  I didn't like the way it was written.  The chapters seemed to be all over the place.  I found it to be boring.  The concept was nice, but I didn't like the book.",2
I'm a believer. Gladwell takes me on an unexpected journey far from my belief systems that savvy and hard work were the key to success. He has opened my eyes to theories about the way the world works that I had never contemplated. Incredibly compelling.,5
Too many words.... The information junkie will love this book. It's filled with stats and interesting stories to back it up. I just felt it had too much unnecessary information.,3
"I do not like to read, but when I do I read ........ Loved the down to earth tone when talking about some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...",5
have become a huge Gladwell fan. fascinating,5
Encouraging.. I learned a lot from this book.,5
I'm not worthy of reviewing such a brilliant book. I will try.,5
"Excellent. This was an excellent book, so good infancy I read it twice in succession.",5
"Interesting Theories Of Success. In Outliers, The Story Of Success, Malcolm Gladwell shows research that puts forward the theory that success is a combination of factors. While intelligence plays a large part, so do birth order, cultural assumptions, and above all hard work. Individuals must have the ability to see opportunities and then have the skills to take advantage of them. ne of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players. They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year. Inexplicable coincidence? No, more likely that this phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed. Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams. his plays out over and over again when trends are seen. The dot-com millionaires? Almost all were born from 1952-1955, when the computer was first introduced to the public, and kids in schools could get hours upon hours of programming time. Successful musicians? Most practice hundreds more hours than those who just never quite make it to the top. Both groups are talented, but one group takes advantage of opportunities and hard work to develop that talent. n one study, bright children in California were tested and tracked for over forty years. Although all started in the brightest groups, by adulthood they had fallen into the superstars, the average and those who didn't quite make it. Luck of the draw? That assumption can be challenged when the facts show that those in the bottom group almost overwhelmingly had parents who were uninvolved in their lives and who didn't help their children focus and refine their talents. Parenting styles seem to make a big difference. ladwell has written a thought-provoking book. His thesis can be summed up in this quote: ""...success follows a predictable course. It is not the brightest who succeed. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ...To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all."" This book is recommended for readers that are interested in learning how the world works and how we might improve it.",5
"Compelling look at non-traditional factors for success. Gladwell succeeds by taking the tack of questioning widely held assumptions and beliefs around success and looking for other factors which contribute to success. Even though the explanations surrounding environment can cause us to pause, especially when the environmental factors can relate back to ethnic and socio-economic factors, they do create a thought-provoking vision.",4
WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,5
Great!!. Needed the book for school and it arrived right on time. 5 stars,5
"Just wonderful. One of my friend suggested this book to me and once i started reading this book, i realized that the success is more of a chance and it not entirely depends upon your efforts.A good read and must for those hungry for success and particularly for ambitious parents",5
"I can't take the full credit for my success.... The above statement is one of the life changing take-aways I have from the book. Gladwell, uses a perfectly selected group of examples to explain the unique, and yet similar circumstances that it took for the Outliers to succeed. However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.",5
Book itself is an outlier. Good book,5
Fantastic Read. It really was a joy to read this book and I learned a lot about things that hadn't ever occurred to me! Definitely recommend giving it a read.,5
Paul.L. it's a powerful tool for young people. I recommend it to positive thinkers out there!,5
"Wonderful read. Great read, very insightful & educating. I really enjoyed learning about reasons for success beyond the outlier's control.",5
"Outstanding...my 2nd best book of all time. Outstanding....I bought a kindle edition, bought another kindle edition for my wife but i need a hard copy for my library. My 7 year old needs to read this at some point.",5
Wonderful. Love this book! About 100 pages in to date...addictive and insightful.,5
"EYE OPENER. An amazing theory, well presented, that there are more factors involved in individual success than are usually thought. When, where, how we came to Earth gives some people advantages without the obvious reasons of being born into wealth, being a genius, or gifted athletically. Backed up with research and statistics, it's a new window into why some people are more successful than most.",5
"Amazing read on the story of success and its' ingredients. Amazing read on the story of success and its' ingredients. This book was a required novel for my English 101 class yet I intend to read it again. Gladwell is a very intelligent man with a knowledge of many, many things. Remember, 10,000 is the key.",5
some surprising keys to success. The author uses multiple examples of how cultures and supporting circumstances contribute to success. His examples are very convincing and provide food for thought as to how we may achieve greater success in education and achievement in this country and around the world if we apply these principles.,5
"Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking. Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking, giving you insight into a multitude of different factors that contribute to success that society often over looks. The book itself was in perfect condition.",5
"Exceptional: Much Better and With Greater Breadth Than Anticipated. It took me a long time to pick up a copy of Outliers to read. I had read many of the print media reviews when the book came out and most, unfortunately, focused on the role of birth month on one's ""success."" I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.",5
Insight on how environment can shape excellence. Gladwell does not disappoint. This is an eye opener wonderfully articulated. It's fascinating to learn about some of the assumptions we have about how to instill greatness in future generations and how we need to break those notions.,5
Four Stars. Good book,4
wonderful and thought provoking. one of my top 5 books would definitely recommend this reading for anyone. intellectual and informative,5
"Good read. This book was great to read, and had some interesting ideas, but the gist of the book is: success is more about the circumstances surrounding a person than the actual qualities of that person. The author sets it up nicely but in the end, it kind of feels like: ""Duh!""",4
An interesting and easy listen. The reasons for success are really quite incredible as evidenced by the research that Malcolm Gladwell has done. I chose this book because my sons (in their mid twenties) told me it was great. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. I think listening to this book would probably be easier than reading it because of the statistical information. Not one to read this type of book (prefer fiction and escapism) I expected to be bored but I was intrigued. It was even more interesting that it was read by Malcolm Gladwell himself. I would highly recommend this book.,4
Four Stars. Good Book,4
Four Stars. Interesting but a little slow. Still working on it.,4
Eye opener. Simply amazing and eye opener.,5
"Good quality book. Not so fun to read.. It wasn't that great of a book to read, but it was required for me to read. However the book came on time, and it was in good condition. It smelled a little weird, but almost every paperback book does.",5
Demystifies greatness. It shows why people in history achieved what they achieved,5
"good book describing what it takes to become really successful. This is a book which would change your notions about success. Most people have the belief that hard work alone could make you successful. But, in this book, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the underlying factors which have an indirect influence on success.",4
"Re-read Even Better Than the First Read. Parts of Outliers hit home for me. I am a retired psychologist who worked with children with special needs. I was born in November in the early post World War II years. Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce. I struggled until I became an adolescent. With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out. It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation. Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools. My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.",5
"Simply explained and still the stories intrigue!. I first discovered Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, Revisionist History because I, too, at that time was thinking about doing a podcast to tell my stories. And while I was not the one to buy the book and my husband not listening to podcasts, I would speaking highly of Mr. Gladwell. My husband the. Took his Master Class online and then bought this book.",5
"Outliers. Great book I've gotta say. If you're looking to nerd out on how successful people get to where they are this is for you. From Bill Gates to pilots to seemingly everything the author has boiled success down to a science and uses seemingly odd details such as birthplace, month of birth, and ancestral background to explain a persons potential for success and how under the right circumstances these favored persons become the greats that we dream of becoming. Very informative.",5
Five Stars. excelente,5
Read the first few chapters. The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell,3
Thought-provoking and captivating. The author does a phenomenal job of presenting facts and studies on individuals success and failure. I highly recommend this audiobook,5
"A Must Read!. This book will change the way you view the world and more importantly your life. As a graduate business student, I would like to see this become required reading.",5
"Great idea in the book but not a full explanation of outliers. I liked the book until the very last bit where the author starts summarizing the book as those with more privilege than others. Although I agree with this point of view to an extent , it is not the full story. The truth is privilege is a factor but not the only variable in successful. Effort & focus are better predictors of success because any person has control over those. Just saying people are privileged if they’re successful doesn’t help anyone in fact it hurts society by instilling doubt in the individual due to his lack of privilege.",4
Good. Was an interesting read. New insights to ponder on success. I found some of the stories and points a bit too repetitive at times.,3
"Outliers book review. I listened to this audio book in May 2018 and the idea stroke me and provided answers to many questions I had regarding success. The author did fantastic research and chose his subjects from many areas such as sports, academics achievement and entrepreneurs. The idea will sure help me raise my kids better and to sincerely look at my success story from different angles. Thanks Malcolm Gladwell",5
Eye Opening and Thought Provoking. One of those books everyone should read. A different way of looking at things we all assume we know all about already.,5
"Outside the Box. This author challenges =conventional= wisdom and supports his premises with facts, figures and real life peoples' stories. If the =powers that be= running the educational system in America read this book and applied subsequent principles, ours would be a very different country.",5
!!!!. TO READ!!! JUST TO IT,5
Five Stars. Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors! His writing is spectacular.,5
"Research and Truth - Malcolm Does It Best. Another one of those books that makes you say, ""Why don't I know this stuff!?"". We spend so much time learning pointless information when real research is being done to display knowledge such as this book. Malcolm is such a phenomenal storyteller and researcher and really dedicates himself to finding the truth. Truly is top notch!",5
Great Book and Quality. I love it,5
"10,000 hours. That's the rule! The ten thousand hour rule makes sense because you find out that all experts had to put the time in to become so.",5
great book great listen. I greatly enjoyed this book it was well written and well directed and the concepts were thought provoking I would has it I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone,5
Highly recommend. Very interesting and insightful,5
"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I Believe his theory on 10,000 hours makes sense to me. I highly recommend thid book.",5
Time for an update. The economy has rolled over .... Time for an update. The economy has rolled over several examples in this book making the theme obsolete.,3
"Eye Opening. I feel that Mr. Gladwell's synthesis of research from a variety of disciplines brings to light the underlying structure of what constitutes success. In doing so he gives us the tools to use ourselves. We can identify the advantages and disadvantages in our lives and cultural heritage. We can recognize where we can grab opportunity and know that hard work, when meaningful, can contribute to our personal success.",5
Five Stars. An excellent read!,5
Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric .... Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric without being too learned for laymen to follow and grasp the concepts. I felt wiser having read this over a period of a few days.,5
Five Stars. Great book. Now I see way it's so popular,5
What we don’t know.. It reveals the Potemkin Village we live in when bombarded by continuous Orwellian Newspeak. The pervasiveness of our western world’ ignorance is shameful.,5
"Loved it!. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. I wasn't sure at first, but soon became enthralled at the research driven content that was made interesting by the stories of people. It's a great book!",5
A different perspective on success stories.. Gladwell tells us that success would depend not only the person himself but also the conditions that surround him and opportunities that would be given to him. The book includes interesting examples about successful people and underlying realities about their success story.,5
"Touching performance. For all of those who felt they fell, just short get a lot of validation and fulfillment from my man Malcolm and his second to latest hit. If you haven’t read talking to strangers, go, read, listen actually.... now!",5
Very interesting!. Great read! The statistics are so interesting. I had no idea certain sports were so skewed in favour of those born at a certain time of year. The fact can be empowering or hindering of course based on where you or your child falls...,5
"Inciteful, Interesting, and Compelling Read. Malcom Gladwell returned with another stellar read. Not only was this book filled with facts, it was interesting and well written. I was engaged and curious until the last pages.",5
Eye opener. It used real life very relatable examples to understand the main purpose of the book.,5
Interesting read. Interesting read but a little repetitive,5
Malcolm Gladwell delivers again. I am not finished with the book but already love it! I've already heard a lot from my friends and Malcolm Gladwell didn't disappoint! I've read Malcolm Gladwell's work before and this is another good book well done!,5
"Good except for Asian generalization. This book was very interesting and there is a lot of research to support the arguments made, except for the final section in the main book which tried to make some pretty broad claims about rice and entrepreneurial drive as the important reason for Asian skills with math. Recommend but keep your skepticism about some of the claims made.",4
"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",4
"Absolute Must Read. Can't stop talking about it, months later.. I read this in the summer and would re-read chapters because I was fascinated with the stories/evidence. By far it is the most incredible dinner, business conversation piece I have ever read. People will be amazed when you ask them a question like: ""Do you know what ties together most of the Junior Hockey League Professional players?"" ""Do you know what causes most major airline crashes?""",5
"A question of generalize what is learned. This book is very good and brings a new perspective towards our vision regarding successful people. However, it feels like it is forcing too much its vision because of a intrinsic limitation: it does not have the time or space to analyze every case of success in every area. So the book simply brings us a paradigm that we may believe it and search for ourselves, or not.",4
Five Stars. great product,5
"The good and the bad. Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.",3
"Great points, but slow at times.. In typical Gladwell fashion, this book has the power to transform the way you think. His evidence is truly compelling and for the most part it's engaging. The one problem I had with this book was how many stories there were. He would start every chapter with a story--often a slow one, building up different characters and setting the stage, and then he would start another story, and another one. You would realize the points of the stories, but he wouldn't really spell it out for you until the chapter's end.",4
"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",4
"Fascinating. Well researched look at success, culture and opportunity.",5
"Seeing the forest instead of the trees. Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere. The successful have ""hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies"" that are doled out unfairly.",5
"Quick service, highly satisfied. Quick delivery, exactly as described. Daughter had to get for school and was so convenient to handle this way!",5
"This is a great read, a must-read. It automatically became one of my top ten books. Gladwell has a unique way to tell interesting stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to learn more about life and how success is not always what we think it is. Eye opening.",5
"Outliers: a must read!. When success is discussed and debated, this book will be its primer. Insightful and observant look at the cultural and human characteristics that affect our lives.",5
"Interesting Stories and Ideas. Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas. Not sure I agree with it all. The author is great and is an excellent writer. I will read more books from this author. The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great. All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books. A very enjoyable read!",4
Highly recommended - researched material makes you think!. Malcolm Gladwell presents facts to support ways of thinking differing from the norm. This makes the reader think and form broader views about things like the road to success and the quality of education. The writer uses stories to keep the reader's interest. I liked the book and saw value in exploring the thoughts presented. I would recommend the book to serious readers.,5
"Very good read. This book is interesting. Gives a lot of insight into what makes a person brilliant in their field. Started reading for school, but ended up really enjoying it.",5
My first Gladwell!. The research done for Outliers was very thorough and allows one to think differently about success.,5
1) Sloppy methodology:,1
"insightful and well researched!. It is a great read! Insightful and well researched. I like the message - do meaningful work and when an opportunity knocks on the door, be prepared to grab it.",5
Success. Amazing book. I'm not one to read but this book got me excited to read. If you love anything to do with success this is the book for you,5
Amazing. A classic,5
"The rich underbelly of all true success stories.. A compelling explanation, and tales of what it takes to be 'a success' fully illustrated with validated science, through engaging, entertaining, and enlightening statistics and the necessary context for understanding something most of us only think we know about. Yet, give little actual thought, or analysis.",5
"If he has written a bad read, I haven't seen it. I have yet to read a Malcolm Gladwell book that didn't really expand my mind. I'm a conservative with years of entrenched thinking. This is the first book in a long time that has altered my compass bearings. I will never see successful people in the same light. It doesn't make you doubt their accomplishments. You do walk away with a better understanding of what is an isn't the cause of them. He ought to do a study on negative outliers too. You walk away with a huge respect for the people in the middle, and those who put in the 10,000 hours.",5
"The book is in perfect condition. This is a very good book, and Amazon did a very good job of delivering it in a timely manner.",5
"Interesting research in a readable format. I have read several Gladwell books but this is my favorite. The idea of what components create ""successful"" people gave me much to think about as a classroom teacher. Gladwell looked at success from a variety of angles and presented his information in a clear, well written style. I gave copies to friends as I found it so interesting.",5
Amazing book. He develops his points in a subtle but shrewd way. Uses great examples from different areas. generally great writing as well,4
Five Stars. As great as expected!,5
"Ser exitoso es también cuestión de suerte. Este libro te lleva a cuestionar la idea de que el éxito de las personas famosas en diferentes áreas son resultado de su esfuerzo cuando en realidad es una suma de factores adicionales como su entorno, su herencia cultural y la suerte.",5
Love the time of the year you were born facts. Very interesting facts.,5
REVEALING. Outliers discusses facts that one just isn't aware of. It's simply a great read.,5
"Fascinating and Compelling Read. I have loved all of Gladwell's books, but this one perhaps the best. This book like his others gives one a new way to look at what is happening in the world. He takes questions that many people have wondered about and gives some unexpected answers with research to back up his findings.",5
Extremely Insightful. You will realize why the people that are successful are successful. Amazing story and amazing detail about how those outliers that we all know came to be.,5
"Malcolm does a great job in telling the stories to help you connect .... This is a fascinating book that is a must read for any business person, entrepreneur, athlete, parent, or any person who has an interest in what factors are needed for people to become successful.",5
Five Stars. Great,5
Opened my mind. This book will give you an entirely new perception on life. I loved it. Thanks Malcolm,5
very good book. Education is about opportunity and how we inspire those those to succeed. We must never stop learning but continue to grow with our own education and support others as we move through life.,5
"000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. In my opinion, all of the teenagers should read this book. In one book Malcolm Gladwell put the years of life experiences of very successful people in this country and abroad. He showed how important to work your 10.000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. You can be born a genius, but you'd accomplish nothing, if you won't work hard, but if you are working hard and long hours, the success would come to you. I appreciate meticulous, hard job Malcolm Gladwell put in this book.",5
Great read. This book is a must for any young adult. The way everything is broken down and simplified is just incredible. I read this book in college and still continue to read it and give it as a gift to people.,5
"Not worth it. The main point of this book is that successful people aren't successful just because of their efforts but also because they got lucky in some ways, for instance Bill Gates was lucky enough to have been a young curious man with access to a computer in a time when it was very hard to get access to a computer.",1
Five Stars. grandson loved it,5
"and could easily have been shorter. This book provides an interesting perspective on why some people achieve success while others of simiilar talent do not. It is repeaticous, however, and could easily have been shorter.",4
"Success Defined. Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining where success comes from. While yes, it comes from hard work, it also has a strong basis in context and in opportunities. It makes you want to help provide more opportunities for succes to those who work hard, in order to make our country and our world even greater.",5
"Hard to digest truth for the ""self made"", hope for the rest. Speechless....! The book that gave me hope if I just keep working hard.",5
"Wonderful read. Great read, very insightful & educating. I really enjoyed learning about reasons for success beyond the outlier's control.",5
Five Stars. If I finish a book it's great!,5
Five Stars. Good seller. Item as described.,5
great motivational read. quick and easy read - this will motivate you be be an 'outlier'.,5
A must read!. Facts and numbers never lies.,5
malcolm gladwell at it again.. a very easy listen. got through half and was excited for the next day to listen more. since finding malcolm and Sam harris I believe that the self made man is a myth and this book really outlines why that is. it makes you wonder what kind of opportunities you've had or will have. reminded me a lot of Matthew McConaugheys 'greenlights' book. highly recommend outliers to anyone especially fans of revisionist history.,5
Incredibly fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants to understand the parameters around success. Absolutely fascinating. I can't wait to read some of his other titles,5
Outliers. I found this book extremely interesting and educational. It gave me a totally new perspective on the influence of social forces on people's lives. I would strongly recommend this book.,4
Really interesting reading. It explains a lot of different thing about differences.,5
Good. Good,5
Mr. This product was in no-way as advertised. The book was in a overall poor condition. Several stains on the outside and broken corners of book. I recieved the book on the very last day of shipment terms. Basically the company quarantined my financial deposit for a period of 15 plus days without any communication of the item being shipped. All one could do is sit and wait for the mail to show up. Poor communication during shipping process. Very poor business practices. Not recommended.,1
Inspiring book. Very very good read. I just didnt like the quality of the book. Im just fussy lol,3
"Great Book. this book explains a lot why we are, how we are and why countries or cultures seldom change.",5
An answer to one of our unending questions. There are certain questions that repeatedly keep coming to our mind...perhaps one of them is what really makes a difference between a successful and unsuccessful person? This book tries to give an entirely different perspective on the above mentioned question. I believe it helps in understanding the interconnection between hard work and luck (can be defined here as inborn advantages) and the role that it can play in achieving success.,5
"Long-winded tunnel vision. I thought the chapter (s?) about air travel would never end! Aside from that, I found too many missing variables as to explain success. The author fails to give credit for individual pioneers, yet ironically gives credit to a collective of group thought. Individuals, particularly religious ones, have historically lost EVERYTHING (family, land, wealth, status, etc) in an attempt to raise the standard across cultures. Many of them have been ostracized or stoned to death by the collective because they like their concubines. They like having slaves. And they love their power. The USA was built on a culture of individualism because it CREATES. It was also built upon the fortitude of individuals who have continually shattered the culture of collectivism. Should they succeed, and be rewarded for their success? YES, because they pave the way for others to live their own individual dreams, and keep building layers, as well. Bill Gates' story is an example of a mentor who fought HARD, you can bet, to obtain or create the equipment Bill learned by. As evidenced by the fact that it wasn't available to the collective, because for the whole, their standard is lower. Individuals reject the bucket of lobsters trying to pull them back down and find a way to climb out. Making a lot of money for their effort is an organic side effect. Idividualism is the crust holding in the apple pie. Without it, we just have applesauce.",1
Very interesting book... I really enjoyed listening to this book. Could not put it down (so to speak). One does not have to agree with or disagree with what he says.. it just adds to our own arsenal of knowledge. Loved it.,5
Great book. As a student of human behavior I have found no writer more interesting than Malcom Gladwell. Concepts of people and events that I thought I had a pretty firm grasp on are much more complex than I may have imagined. I appreciate the mind of this author and his ability to dig in to the complexities of the human condition to paint a more complex and I believe accurate picture. I’ve now read 5 books by this man and will read everything this man ever writes.,5
"Extremely fascinating and eye opening.. I really appreciated the fact that Gladwell did not try to say that he had found the single key to success. He made it clear that many factors contribute to success, and his examples really help the reader understand those different factors. It is easy to think that someone is successful because they are smarter, were given great advantages, worked harder, or were just plain lucky. This book helps one understand the role that intelligence, great opportunity, hard work, luck etc... actually play in success. I think this would be a great read for a book club. There is a lot that invites discussion. I usually read fiction, but am very glad that a friend recommended this book.",5
Terrific book. Excellent listen. Great story and content. Entertaining and thought provoking. I will read more by this author.,5
No one is a special snowflake - it's all down to science and circumstance. What you realize after reading the book: individual success is fake - oftentimes it is the result of multiple factors contributing to a single outcome.,5
Wow.. Wow!,5
Excellent book. Would highly recommend.. Excellent book. Would highly recommend.,5
Makes you think!. I'm half way through this book! Well written and easy read! It's really making me think!,5
Pretty good. Good book. Great writer,4
"Good but not what I was expecting. *Edit* I would recommend listening to the end interview first. It put the book more into a perspective i wish i had during the book. As I said in my comment below that the book is very respectable and brings up very interesting ""Coincidences"" that relate to background and circumstance.",3
excellent listen. malcom gladwell narration is superb and the book is brilliant. very different take on successful people,5
"A great book if you believe it's pointless trying to excel in life, as the odds are against you. I never leave reviews, but this book is a travesty. I am blown away and confused over the positive reviews this book has received.",1
"Eye-opening. Well written and at times humorous, ""Outliers"" weaves together hockey players, Bill Gates, lawyers, and Chinese rice farmers to broaden our understanding of how and why some achieve success, while others who seem equally qualified plod on.",5
"Five Stars. I like the way Malcolm writes, so of course I love it!! Shipping was prompt!",5
Amazing. truly one of the best books I've ever listened to. The author uses an evidence-based approach to present a seemingly set a reality about success and it's definition and how it intertwines with opportunity and hard work.,5
Great read!. Fabulous book and one of my All-time favorites.,5
life perspective adjuster. It sounds like hyperbole but it's just a fact that this book had been life altering for me. It actually has helped me define the purpose for the rest of my life: to be a part of a community which provides opportunities.,5
Well worth the time.. This book far exceeded my expectations - even after having read Blink. Definitely makes you think about the world around in you in a different way. If you have kids you might find yourself frustrated by how we are implementing education and sport selection.,5
Five Stars. Great book! Highly recommend all his books,5
Best Book!. Best book ever!,5
"To sum it up, you can be lucky, or not. I enjoyed listening to the book, however, in the end, Gladwell concludes that an outlier for success is heavily determined by opportunities given to us from the moment we were born. This strikes little hope for those who want to be successful but weren't lucky enough to be born into an environment capable of guiding them to success.",4
Wish I read this 20 years ago. Great book.,5
astounding. this book is a must if you have or plan to have children. it makes you understand why culture matters and how it influences the lives of people,5
"Absolute Genius. This is the first book I read for Malcom Gladwell, and I am impressed. The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",5
"Excellent use of examples and data. This nonfiction piece was the required reading for students taking AP Language in the fall at our local high school. I read it so I could work with a young girl I mentor.As a former high school English teacher, I found it very engaging- a difficult task for non fiction writers. My teen reader also liked it.",4
"Enlarging Your Frame of Reference. If you like to read to broaden your horizons, to challenge your way of thinking, to stimulate new ideas, and if you do not like overly pretentious, academic books that are bogged down in techno-speak and footnotes, then you will love this book. No, the writer is not presenting original research but Malcolm Gladwell is a genious at taking the research of others and putting it together in new ways that are thought provoking and mind-changing. I read this book very quickly but the ideas presented here about success and how it is attained will stay with me for a long time. It has changed how I look at myself and others. It is a wonderful book for discussion and could not be more timely as a we start a new administration committed to change.",5
"This book will stick with me.... I was fortunate to hear Malcolm Gladwell speak recently while at a conference. I had never read one of his books but after that conference I could not wait to do so. I decided to start with this book because my 16 year old son is required to read for his Junior Honors English class in high school (summer reading). I thought it would be a good book to discuss together. Was I right! He liked it just as much as I did. And, he is a hockey player born in August...this book really hit home for him and now has the reason why he will never be a professional hockey player in the NHL:)",5
"An Awesome Read. As an educator of gifted students, I found this book an interesting and enlightening read. This book should be included on every college's freshman reading list. An awesome read for every student, educator, and professional!",5
Enjoying now. Great short reads,5
Five Stars. I really enjoyed this book.,5
Eye opener. Simply amazing and eye opener.,5
Fascinating. Every chapter was so interesting.,5
"Outliers. This book is well worth reading. It is a fascinating look at all the factors that go into the making of success or failure, with Bill Gates and The Beatles as examples of success, and the Korean Airline as an example of failure. I couldn't put it down.",5
"Five Stars. GREAT PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY. AAA+++",5
"intellectually stimulating. Reading/listening to Malcolm Gladwell is like dining at a sushi bar run by a world renowned sushi chef. No menu, no courses, no artificially large servings, just a masterfully designed nourishing experience where each mouthful is a unique treat that builds on the one before and all taken together leaves you delighted in the end.",5
Five Stars. Great read! Makes you think about destiny versus determination and the combination of both.,5
Must read. This book will add new perspective to your life. It will let you see things from a new side.,5
Good but way to long. I got some great info out of this book. It’s just very long winded and drawn out. The info learned could have been said in a few chapters.,2
Great topic. The students were excited to get this book.,5
Required reading for college class. Required reading for college class,5
"Not bad, but not as engaging as Blink or Tipping Point. I'm a fan of Gladwell's work, but this book did not grab me with the same intellectual hook as his prior two efforts. The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me. The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",3
Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Outliers: The Story of Success,4
"great listen on what goes on behind success. The author does an amazing job at explaining how timing is affected with people's success. And how being born just a few years difference can make a great difference. also a giant takeaway was it takes about 10,000 hours to become an expert in a field",5
great listen with a wealth of knowledge.. This book touches on a wide variety of factors that I never considered when trying to measure why someone was successful or is successful. It has really expanded my knowledge and helped me on my personal journey and my growth as a parent.,5
"Outliers is very enlightening. I've always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and articles,and this book is no exception. He always has a ""not so fast"" response to our preconceptions.",5
First Gladwell book but not my last.. Two weeks after receiving this book I'm now on my third Malcolm Gladwell book. Amazing author who writes in a style to draw the reader into every story.,5
good but repetitive. Well written. But the chapters (at least the first few) are very long and repeat,3
Make you think. Gladwell does a great job of making you think about successful people in a different light. He basically says that there are other events that occurred along the way that helped them become successful...no one does it alone.,5
Five Stars. Great stories within the book!,5
"He has a good thought. Great little read. I wasn't sure I agreed with his thesis at first, but he gradually won me over.",5
"Sensible.. Nice application of tons of data to a truism: none of us ""makes it"" alone.",5
"I never knew.... Never judge a book by its covers, especially when it doesn't have a cover (read it on my Kindle). I read this book with never knowing that hard work could breed success. The 10,000 hour rule that was mentioned was very profound and devastating. I am a professional in the medical field, and after reading this book I no longer feel that it's ethical for me to continue practicing. I hope to one day practice again, but I want to wait until I've got a little more practice under my belt (8200 hours to go).",5
"Interesting...very interesting!. I read this because it was the summer reading assignment for my seniors this year. It started off really strong with some amazing information, but somewhere toward the middle it started getting a little dull. Upon our classroom discussion, most of the kids agreed with me on this point. However, I still would say it is worth reading because it raises some curious issues.",4
"makes you think. the many examples in the book give a lot of perspective for thinking about how people get where they are. study hard, Patrice hard, and put yourself in the best position to succeed. comparing yourself to ultra successful people isn't good because those people are self made..tl.they were given opportunities and they used them. some just got lucky.",5
Eye opening and intriguing. Malcolm Gladwell dives into famous succesx stories and unveils the curtain behind their rise to stardom. Oppurtunity mixed with hard work is what makes the difference and in the end. You need both to be an outlier.,5
"A Good ""Eye Opener"" but Gladwell Goes to Far. Outliers, like many of Gladwells other books, starts with a rather simply idea and supports it through various stories. In this case the idea that Gladwell promotes is that massive success, such as that achieved by Bill Gates or The Beatles, occurs not primarily from hard work or raw talent but rather from a ""patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” Gladwell weighs luck above all other criteria in any success story.",3
"Great book.. Love the content and current examples. Its about effort and time 10,000 hours that gives you the edge.",5
"Interesting thoughts, findings and conclusions.. Fascinating view on the intricacies of the environment that cultivates certain behaviors, traditions even the skin color resulting in people's lives being full of happiness or shallow decades and centuries after...",5
Five Stars. My husband loved this book.,5
Five Stars. Enlightening and motivating read!,5
"Malcolm Gladwell fan. It's another great work by Malcolm Gladwell. I find his look at social psychology interesting. This book is inspiring because it takes a little of the magic away from how Bill Gates, famous musicians, sports players, and more made it to the big time.",5
"5 stars. Such a great book, ai can't stop reading it! Arrived fast and was in excellent shape.",5
"A Self-Help Book You Can't Pass Up!. Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is. Reading this book will give you an entirely different outlook on not only the world around you but also our worlds history and how today has come to be. This book is a #1 national bestseller for a reason and you will not regret making the decision to read it!",5
Amazing. A classic,5
"An important book. This is not just a good book. This is an important book. One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.",5
super interesting. really gets you thinking a different way about success. you can change your whole thought process,5
"Interesting perspective!. I preferred BLINK to this read, but OUTLIERS was still a good read in regards to a unique perspective as to why certain people are inherently successful. Give it a go!",4
"The Keys to Success aren't what you think they are. Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com",5
"Highly entertaining. As with all of Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers is crack journalism, brilliant, and fascinating. Gives the reader a compelling argument that success is determined by both fate and hard work and dedication. I often refer to Gladwell's anecdotes when making sense out of how things unfold in the ""real world.""",5
Stories that resonate. There were several examples in this book that were extremely interesting and offered a fresh perspective but ultimately it seems like the stars aligned and the perfect combination of factors influenced success in many of the big stories.,4
"MUST READING!. Great lessons on the value of original thinking, that conventional thinking can and should be challenged. I have read it several times.",5
"Worth Reading. I like Malcolm Gladwell, and this is probably his most applicable book -- it inspires and demonstrates his theories, rather than just explaining that they exist. I use it as a text in my AP Language class, and it is, by far, the kids' favorite read because it applies to their lives.",4
"I personally didn't like that the author contributed a lot (maybe most) of .... I personally didn't like that the author contributed a lot (maybe most) of these people's success to luck. The stories were great and I enjoyed the writing as well, but I wouldn't necessarily agree with the author.",3
"Interesting. I enjoyed much of this book, but I sometimes felt that Gladwell cherrypicked his examples to fit his thesis and contorted others for the same purpose.",4
outstanding and enlightening... the real secret of success. Malcolm hit it on the head with this book on success. It's encouraging and discouraging all in the same thought,5
"Couldn't put it down. As with his other two books, The Tipping Point and Blink, I couldn't put this book down. Malcom Gladwell's writing is captivating. His ability to share information through relevant story telling is unparalleled.",5
Phenomenal!. I really enjoyed the reading this book period from the beginning the story telling back a by facts and history made it such an easy read. I love the way he describes the stories paints the characters and open your eyes to events so simple yet extraordinary. I highly recommend this book.,5
"a startling collection of real life examples of time and place which look like chance, but are well-crafted and purposeful momen. Astonishing patterns that Maclom Gladwell has assembled here! Rich in detail, and a compelling and the unfolding storyline capture your interest from the start - hockey players ages, Bill Gates 'dropout' luck, Beatles overnight success....a startling collection of real life examples of time and place which look like chance, but are well-crafted and purposeful moments in time and opportunity that are much more than a '30 second soundbite'. Excellent read, and kept me hungering for me as the book unfolded. One in a hundred of books that I will remember for a lifetime. A great and satisfying read",5
Looks like super people not so special after all.. Looks like super people not so special after all.,4
"Five Stars. nice book, friendly seller!",5
Made well just a stupid book. Had to read for school.,2
"Great Perspective!. If you haven't checked out ""Revisionist History"" podcasts you should. Same author in very different topics.",5
"Enlightening. This book is amazing.. I read the paperback copy & loved it soo much I wanted to read again, this time listening to it out loud was the route I went… it gives you a real explanation of success & makes it easier to compare yourself to others so much( even though a lot of comparisons are made in this book)…. I highly recommend",5
"Understanding how people became successful sounds dull, but what a great read!. 10000 hours of practice to make someone succeed. Seems obvious but how often it does not happen. Good training programs would really help our country and economy grow and make everyone more successful.",5
"Discovering the amazing background to peoples' successes.. This book helped me gain perspective on inter-cultural I have had over the past 1/2 century. I wish I had known this outlook, perspective when lived overseas. I recommend it to all individuals/couples who are living and working in the developing World.",5
Outliers. Unique and interesting,4
Five Stars. Gladwell - always very good.,5
"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",4
Outliers. This is a VERY thoughtprovoking book! Causes one to take a second look at the world and how it functions. Gladwell did an excellent job of explaining the concept and supporting research in a way that is easily understandable. I have recommended this book to my friends as it represents breakthrough thinking. A great read!,5
Four Stars. Interesting stories about real life situations.,4
"gives hope to us all that no one is special its all circumstances and luck. this gives an interesting perspective on how to view anyone that has ""made it"". In the end Malcolm says no one is special only perhaps their circumstances were special and in effect it was all just in where they happened to be at any given moment. In a strange way this book both gives hope but also can be a little depressing",5
psychology and self examination made simple. Gladwell has the uncanny ability to reveal the psychology of the human species and cause any sincere observer to turn his mirror on oneself. Great read. Very thought provoking!,5
"I didn't realize that!. Mr Gladwell's intelligence is evident on every page: and he shares it so well! There are so many interesting facts. I just loved the way he tied them together to explain things that we just take for granted. I generally read fiction, but I occasionally make exceptions. I am so glad I did, as I thoroughly enjoyed every word in this book.",5
"Shines a light on bias, nature vs nature. Brilliant book, you'll love this if you like books such as Freakonomics",5
"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",4
Many things. This book was very good.,5
Five Stars. great book,5
"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",4
"Thought Provoking. I am an entrepreneur and we're always looking for the ""secret"" - the extra edge. This book goes so much deeper than the drama of the accomplishments of someone successful and looks at the background of what led to their circumstances. Enlightening.",5
Nice listen. important and useful takeaways.. Interesting points made. Different insights. The book could have been concise. Felt it dragged a bit at some parts. Worth a listen.,5
"Clearly written abstract concepts. Malcolm is one of the greatest minda of our time. He writes in a concise, clear style. He enables readers to understand abstract doncepts.",5
"Intrigued. I found myself highlight a lot of text and if there was one thing that was accomplished - he forced me to consider a different perspective, I was not comfortable with the ending however. I found it hard to accept as a good ending to the story. Maybe because it should have been a separate book and this wasn't the right setting for where his personal story could have gone. The ending was heavy and took the book in a totally different direction and didn't bring all of his points together .",3
"Interesting theory but not totally accurate. I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory. I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.",4
"Satisfied. This is a good book, and an easy read. It had some interesting concepts and ideas. Very mind opening. I am satisfied with this purchase.",5
FascinAting. Couldn’t put this one down...a fascinating read!!!,5
"Amazing book!. Incredibly insightful and inspiring. One of the best reads of my life, a book that definitely leaves you thinking.",5
"Amazing, and informative. A well researched compilation of incredible stories of human achievement based on an assortment of circumstance. Both intriguing and enlightening. Damn good read!",5
Thank You. Interesting stories to read and values to learn are an important part of this book. Find your own meaning within these stories because each one is very different.,5
Great listen. Enjoyed the entire book thoroughly. He takes you on a journey to many parts of the world and makes a strong case for the theory of success. Fantastic.,5
New point of view on success. An awesome way of looking into people's success. Changed the way I look at how people(including me) achieve success in their careers.,5
"Brilliant, breath-taking and brutal. This book deflates prior misconceptions of the heroes journey as one man's fight against fate. Rather, it emphasizes the truism that it takes a whole village to make a Buddha",5
Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was .... Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was happy to add to my personal library again. I recommend Caldwell's OUTLIERS to everyone.,5
"Five Stars. This was a very enjoyable and informative book. Not only does this detail some methods of thinking that are outside of the box and beneficial to the reader, but it also going a long way to help inspire you to overcome difficulties in your own life. While this is coming from a motivational book and speech lover, I believe that everyone could benefit by reading this book. It is my hope to teach classes one day, and this is one book that I would definitely like to bring into the classroom. I feel that students and adults alike will gain from reading. Well worth the money.",5
Wonderfully Innovative. The research and conversational writing make this a wonderful must read. It will be particularly interesting for parents and educators.,4
"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",4
Awesome book I couldn't put it down!. I devoured this on the beach.,5
Amazing book.. One of the best books I have ever read. When I become the King of the world I would make this book mandatory readying for everyone 😊.,5
"This is one of those books that give popular nonfiction a bad name. Which is unfortunate, because what could be better than books that both educate and entertain? But Outliers embodies everything that people who sneer at the genre are talking about: its conclusions are both obvious and simplistic, its writing persuasive but glib. It’s easy to see why Gladwell is a popular author: he’s a good storyteller, his writing accessible and entertaining. But this book is so riddled with oversimplified con",2
"Love the new perspective on success. Great read/listen. I listened during my commutes in the morning and loved the lessons in the book. I also enjoyed when Gladwell would continually reference old chapters, it helped with retention of information.",5
Easy to read.. Loved it.,5
"Four Stars. Good read, interesting stats, conclusions may not be fully accurate, variety of outliers helps reader see similarities.",4
Five Stars. Great read!,5
"Great Book!. I purchased this book for my college English class; I dreaded reading this book. However, after reading it, I have got to thank my professor for choosing such a great book! There's a ton of facts in here that will blow your mind! This book is a must read! Defintely one of the best books I've read!",5
interesting story about what came before. Really interesting story about what history has set up for us. However there were stories that ran too long and this detracted from the otherwise great idea of historical impact on current life.,4
"thought provoking.. Most thought provoking book that I have read in a while. I would recommend this to my friends, and anyone that is looking for thinking out of the box.",5
"If you want to know why you can't be successful .... This book is a book that tells why others are successful. It has nothing to do with the reader, unless you were born on a certain day, had certain parents, etc. etc. <br /><br />Blah blah blah.<br /><br />Nothing useful unless you want to know why you can't succeed and why you can't do anything about it.",1
MUST READ. Fantastic book. Talks about success in a way where you dont feel you have been failing all your life. So the stories and characters are great. It is not one of those I told you so books it actually teaches through its stories.,5
"Good but fairly general info.... This book was recommended to me by a professor of mine. It has a lot of good/interesting information in it but I'm not 100% certain that all the thoughts in this book are well laid out or at least aren't described thoroughly enough to convince me. I would still consider it a good read, like most of Gladwell's material.",3
"Great listen. This book was a great listen with interesting stories interwoven with facts and all at a great pace. This book really got me thinking about the interconnectivity of the timing of events in my own life, in my family's, and in my culture.",5
"Success Is Not Luck. This is a great read! Often in a conversation I'll bring up part of this book. I'm looking at success differently now. What would appear to be luck or coincidence is given support as a series of events that lead the individuals within a group to the success detailed. Hockey players, computer ""geniuses"", musicians, business people are all given the deep dive into what allowed them to be at the top of their different fields. The book is broken into chapters that can be read individually similar to a book of short stories. I read this over a long period of time and didn't lose anything by not picking it up daily or weekly.",5
"This is not an inspirational story if you are looking for one. Outlier is just a product of luck and effort, but mostly luck according to the author. It feels like it’s depend on your society, community and your early education. Not sure if I like this book or not. But agree that one must work hard and work smart.",3
Must read!. Great insight in how successful people have made it to where they are! This books steps away from the self made man and introduces factors that shapes a successful person. It will definitely open different point of views!,5
Thank You. Interesting stories to read and values to learn are an important part of this book. Find your own meaning within these stories because each one is very different.,5
"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",3
Great read. Amazing book. Well worth a read.,5
"Must read for all parents, nannys and teachers!!!. I found this book so interesting I bought it for my sister and mother of a 7 year old girl. I genuinely believe if parents would put what they will learn in this book to practice at home, the children of our next generation will all be happy rock stars!!",5
Five Stars. Inspirational.,5
"Nice reminder, too narrow.. Outliers: the one sided story of success.",4
"Highly Recommend. Outliers was very informative and eye-opening. Gladwell certainly did his research. While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me? What steps do I need to take to replicate the ingredients for success? The answers to these questions go mainly unanswered. With that being said, I highly recommend the book! It is excellent information and with a little work I think we can come up with some great applications to propel ourselves toward greatness!",4
"I hesitate to give this even one star but I .... I hesitate to give this even one star but I am doing so because i think his point about how the factors of the time, the environment and the culture enable or harm one's ability to succeed. However the absence of women in his examples is just so glaring, that accompanied by his refusal to acknowledge the impact of racism, sexism and the discrimination every wave of immigrants to this country faced makes his work invalid.",1
"Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to. One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret. It means looking at ourselves, at work habits, our cultural legacy and asking ourselves some hard questions. Gladwell's thesis is inescapable and puts the responsibility on each of us to create a better world and a better self.",5
"Great Book!. I very much enjoyed the book with the interesting insights and comparisons. Success can be attributed to luck, hard work and opportunities.",5
"Culture can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",4
Four Stars. Good read,4
"Great glimpse into a world we live in that we never really see.... Thoughtful, compelling, real, and vivid... I was recommended this book so many times, and I'm really glad I finally read it. It made me see things that I've looked at a million times so differently! I really love his books and honestly, his writing is worth the trendy praise. It's a quick read and absolutely worth it.",5
love it!. must read! love it!,4
"Another facinating read. Malcolm Gladwell's books are always a fascinating read. I find myself quoting him in conversation. He gives reasoning behind beliefs I have long held and point out ""obvious"" conclusions I can't believe I never thought of. Being a fact based person, I find his conclusions well founded. I highly recommend all of his books!",5
"First 200 pages: fantastic; Last 150: mostly fillers. This is simply one of the best books I have read..for the first 200 pages. Unfortunately, the last 150 pages mostly wasted my time.",4
"A must read. This book should be required reading for leaders of any walk of life, especially anyone thinking they did on their own. ""self-made"" is a misnomer. Everyone has to have along the path of success.",5
Thought-Provoking. Most interesting. I made a note regarding the math talked about with about 1:30 left in chapter 6.,5
Five Stars. Ecellent book,5
"very informative work, I look forward. to other works by this author. I support anyone thinking about reading this book. fifteen words.",5
This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining. This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining! Serious success really comes down to luck of the draw.,4
HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book. Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221; My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work. The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other. Well how does the author know this? Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates? To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control). Fun book. I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,4
"A great read and worth every penny!. My first Malcolm Gladwell book and definitely not my last. The book does a great job analyzing talent and success, and the seemingly minor or unnoticed entites that play a large part in determining the disposition of a person. There are a million reviews on this book but I feel it was well written and very entertaining; I found myself not wanting to stop reading! 'Outliers' will be a book that will not just sit and collect dust. This was a great book and great purchase.",5
"Good but wrong about science. Gladwell writes an interesting book here and he is certainly brings forth many interesting stories and examples of environmental influences on kid's outcomes. I think he overplays his hand a bit and ignores much of what biological science say about theses things. For example Asian kids being better at math, well they are still better at math even when they are raised in or adopted into another culture or country. Maybe rice farming did make them better at math, but this characteristic goes beyond mere culture because you can remove culture and it still remains. The same goes for much of the other topics in the book. There's a bit of liberal fantasy about the whole thing, like Gladwell wishes the world were a certain way and then just starts pretending it is as he wishes, regardless of contrary evidence.",3
"Wonderfully fresh take on success. Very smartly written book that made me think differently about success and what conditions are needed to get ahead in the modern world. As a parent, this book challenged my assumptions of the middle class advantages and what we can do as a society to learn from our failures and successes.",5
Unexpected. Good read,5
"One of the greatest books I have ever read!. Malcolm Gladwell has truly outdone himself. I read Freakonomics recently before reading Outliers and while I really enjoyed Freakonomics, I felt Outliers was more interesting and relevant. Gladwell expertly explains how certain people have become successful and what factors affect one's success, while also answering questions like why Asians are good at math. The book includes information from experts and even quotes from the various people discussed in the book, making Outliers all the more credible. Gladwell's writing is fantastic, easy to follow, and makes this book a real page turner. The book has a nice flow to it, each chapter building on the previous one. Gladwell nicely ends Outliers with his own family story about success, which illustrates all of his arguments presented in the book. Freakonomics exposes the ""hidden side of everything,"" but Outliers exposes the ""facts and reasons behind everything."" I recommend it to everyone I know and one of my friends liked it so much she read the entire book in one night. I loved this book and looked forward to reading it everyday. I learned so much and loved every chapter. I even learned to look past common misconceptions such as ""rags to riches."" I cannot say enough good things about this book. It will change your outlook on life and any previously held beliefs you had about success.",5
Five Stars. Exactly what we wanted,5
"Practical, fascinating and Useful. Caldwell's ""Outliers"" has a fascinating treatment of the question of what leads to success. The insights provided are practical and inspiring for the 'average' person. I've used it in my classroom several times - great stuff!",5
Excellent book; well adapted for the audio format. Unusual take on a topic that is taken for granted. The author's voice enhances the message-highly recommended audiobook-perhaps my best book of the year!,5
"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",4
"Awesome, eyeopening, great as all his books.. Awesome, eyeopening, great as all his books.",5
"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",4
"Great Read. I bought this book because it was recommended by my guitar teacher. I haven't finished it but it is very intriguing even if it shows me that I will probably never be a Jimmy Hendrix. : ) It is excellent in quality and the price was great, too.",5
Outliers is outstanding. What made Bill Gates a computer whiz at a time when very few people knew about computers? How did Wayne Gretzky become such an outstanding hockey player? What are the circumstance that make an individual just good and another great? The answers may surprise you.,5
"Read it. This is a great book for anyone, but especially parents, who of course are intensely interested in the topic.",5
Highly recommended. I love Malcolm Gladwell. And this book is yet another example of why.,5
Better than the Talent code- both are worth reading.. As I read this book I kept saying these people are not outliers and then in the end Gladwell validates my suspicions!,4
Five Stars. Very interesting,5
Another way of seeing.. My 16 year old grandson was asked to read this over the summer. I read it in order to talk with him about it. I thought the first 1/2 was the most applicable for a teenager and I enjoyed that part the best. I look forward to some discussion once he has also read it. I am an MSW and always am intrigued by this type of book that takes a new way of seeing human accomplishment.,4
Five Stars. Thanks! Exactly as described and fast shipping!,5
Pretty good. Very interesting.. Good outcomes are a combination of lucky circumstances to set up people to be able to work hard. If people combine those lucky circumstances with their own effort and intelligence that's a recipe for success.,4
"Great book!. Outliers gives an excellent and true explanation about the success factors, taking opportunities, practicing, learning about your past and looking to succeed with this.",5
Fascinating. I give this book 5 out of 5. It was riveting from start to finish and made me look at this idea of success from a totally different perspective. The stories are emotional and compelling. I want to read it again and again.,5
Solutions!!!. What a great read! I've recommended it to several people who have enjoyed it equally.,5
"A Different View of Success. I first heard about this book when Chris Rock referred to it on The Howard Stern Show. When Stern asked Rock what it took to be a great standup comic Rock replied, ""ten thousand mother f***ing hours."" Stern got the reference right away, saying ""Malcolm Gladwell right?"" and Chris Rock said, ""it's my bible."" I downloaded this to my kindle before the interview was over.",4
Five Stars. Loved this book fascinating stories,5
"Inspiring but wrong. This is an entertaining (and somewhat convincing) book. However, when you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that most of Gladwell's work has been discredited by science and has no more bearing on Psychology than one's astrological sign.",2
"Great book. I enjoy how Gladwell helped me see so many factors to the success people have. It would seem that nearly everything can help propel a person forward or just the wrong combination could hold them back, but hard work makes a huge difference!",5
"I really enjoyed this book.. Everyone comes from somewhere, after all. Nice to hear it recognized so pointedly. Also, gladwell is a terrific narrator.",5
Understanding terms and reasoning.. Learning different ways and the terms in which make certain people; who they are and why. I like learning things and reasons for why people get where they are. Conditions are definitely a big reason for peoples outcome. All in all a great lesson.,5
Slightly disappointed. the quality of book is not so good and also old one. I always received good quality books from flipkart bt this book not upto the standard.,2
Eye opening. A must read for new parents. Makes you realize how important it is to take advantage of every opportunity and that hard work does have its rewards.,4
Fantastic. Great book that shows insight into understanding why certain people succeed. Interesting concepts. I'll be reading all of Gladwell's books after this one.,5
well written!. impressed with the details. really makes you think. i wonder what opportunities i missed! will read his other books.,5
"Pick one thing you want to be really good at and put in the 10. It's simple really. Pick one thing you want to be really good at and put in the 10,000 hours to achieve mastery.",5
"My new must-read suggestion. My hope is that the ideas in this book take hold in Western culture, that we as a society begin to see the individual does not pull themselves up by the bootstraps, rather a series of fortunate events including--but not limited to--opportunity, ability, and willingness to do hard work lead to success. The opportunities so many are denied helps the reader realize that there is really no such thing as an ""outlier"" as an individual phenomenon, rather the community and conditions set the stage to catapult someone outside the norm.",5
A different theory.. An interesting presentation concerning achievement and what are the reasons some are successful. A different theory than the usual work hard and have inherited abilities.,4
Must. Must read by all. It shows what is possible with hard work if you are in tune to the work or the needs of the time/ community.,5
Great read. Great book,5
Fascinating.. His explanation of what makes individuals unique and successful is really fascinating. Made me take a second look at my own talents and those of my family.,5
"Not my taste. Such a drag, some parts picked up, others just boring.",2
"Finally, a book I liked from Malcolm Gladwell. Success isn't coincidental; it's a matter of context. Outliers don't become outliers due to their skills, but to the way (and date) they've been born, the way circumstances led them to success, their culture, their network, their family, and luck.",5
Five Stars. Loved it.,5
Outliers: The story of success. I read this book twice before I bought it to pass along to others in my family. I think they were tired of my talking about it so much.,5
Four Stars. is pretty good,4
A review of Outliers. A Review of Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell,4
Recieved in good condition. The product was received inn perfect condition. The dilevery was prompt.,5
"Something to think about. It is a factual book so you need to be in that frame of mind when you pick it up. It has a lot of interesting ideas, however there were times when I considered the information obvious when Gladwell was trying to deliver it as a revelation. He has a good style of mixing the statistical data he is trying to get across with light anecdotes and case studies.",3
Five Stars. So far so good,5
"eye opening. It's an eye-opening take of what variables lead to success, and makes you question your firmly held beliefs and how successful people make it.",5
Four Stars. like,4
"Interesting. Very neat perspective on why some people are successful. Good condition, good content, good shipping, and good product! I had to purchase this pro for an AP English Class I am taking. So far so good!",5
Eye opening and Uplifting in the most real of ways. Mr. Gladwell does an amazing job of presenting and guiding you through a new way of looking at success and hard work. I remained deeply invested through the entire book.,5
"I was wrong!. I thought I had read the hardcopy book before. but hearing this audible made me realize that I really hadn't, lol! This was a unique account/story/book I won't forget in a hurry! Awesomeness all round!",5
Four Stars. Gladwell's inquisitive mind produces another best seller.,4
Fast paced. Book moves quickly and the short stories used to describe these concepts were interesting and enlightening.,4
Terrific. Excellent book about why some people are more successful than others. Couldn't keep it down,5
"Outliers - Gladwell - A Good Tour of the Outer End of Normality. I read the book as it is on a reading list for my job. It is an easy read and I caution you about the actual science behind it; we readers just swallow some things without checking. However, it is, like many of his books, a good tour of the subject and worthy of our time.",4
Packed Full of Great Information. This is a really interesting book! Full of valuable information! I read this for my book club and would highly recommend for others to do the same. After reading this you want a forum through which to discuss all the data that was shared.,5
"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.",4
"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye.""",2
I still think about what he said in this book!. This book has so much practical common sense and insight. I still think about this book even after reading it a two years ago. I think I'm going to go back and listen to it again. It's so insightful.,5
"Finding time to read during golf season.. Very interesting stuff, for everyone, but especially for educators and people in the airlines industry.",5
Love the narrative.. Mr. Gladwell has done a fine job of objectively discussing examples. This is a must hear book.,5
"Fast delivery, good quality paper. Fast delivery, best quality for price, have little mark on cover the rest okay",5
"Excellent book if you want to take out excuses. Excellent book if you want to take out excuses of your way. I like it because talks about success in other perspectives, and gives you more confidence in your potential.",5
Should be required reading for all parents. I read a library copy of the book and decided I must have my own copy. This was the reason for my purchase. I am convinced this should be required reading for any person who is or wants to be a parent.,5
"Superman Might Not be so Super. I like that this book took a different approach to those that seem to rise above the rest. Gladwell did not glorify, rather, brought them back down to the ground for us to see. It actually follows suit with thoughts on who you surround yourself with and being at the right time in the right place. It isn't the individual as much as having access to the opportunity and proper support. Superman isn't super without his powers nor did he himself create his powers. The one rub with this book is the narration. Gladwell has this sinister tone that would be good as a villain in a1920s detective story or a Batman villain.",4
"Senior English. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School. For our English class this year, we read Outliers: The Story of Success. Outliers seemed like the perfect book to evaluate our essential question; to what extent do time and place define a person? The purpose of having an essential question is to promote greater levels of thinking, which, in turn allows us to evaluate situations with a new perspective that looks beyond the obvious. The information presented in Outliers was perfect for our English course because it evaluated each situation with a deeper outlook. For instance, instead of coming to the conclusion that Korean pilots are naturally inclined to crash planes, the book evaluated reasons such as Power Indexes, and different cultures' tolerance for ambiguity. It is logical process of evaluating all aspects of a situation before jumping to conclusion that makes Outliers relevant to our course of study. hile reading the book, I found some of the presented answers to be illuminating while I found others to be overly general. For instance, Chapter 2 discussed the 10,000-Hour Rule, which I found to be rather interesting because it explained why people like Bill Gates are successful. Many of us often wonder what it takes to be next Bill Gates and I found it surprising that the answer is practice. My dad, like most parents, is always telling me that practice makes perfect. I've always found it hard to believe that practice is all it takes but I have to admit that, after reading Outliers, it does make sense. When I used to play violin, I found that the best violinists were the ones who practiced a lot. They were the ones that took lessons early in their childhood and as a result, they are able to accumulate many practice hours. However, I am glad you pointed out that other factors like opportunity and time play a role in determining success. he chapter that I found most insightful was Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, in which you discussed a theory on why Asians are so good at math. As an Asian, I was really glad that you chose to address this topic because many of my friends subscribe to the misconception that Asians are naturally good at math. I have always wondered; why exactly are Asians good at math but time after time, I have failed to procure a reasonable answer. I was almost convinced that maybe Asians are just naturally good at math when I read your book. I found it rather interesting that there was a correlation between hard work in the rice paddies and one's ability to do math. Reflecting back, it makes perfect sense because those in my school who are the best at math are the ones who don't give up. I was also surprised that you related math and language. I tested your theory that the Chinese language makes it easier to memorize numbers, by asking my dad to repeat numbers in Chinese and it turns out that he could remember them. On the other hand, I could not when I repeated the numbers in English. (Cont. on next review)",4
A Fascinating Read!. I loved this book - couldn't put it down - and when I finished it I bought three more copies and gave them to family members as gifts!,5
Planning for future of children. This is good info. Good for advising schools and next generation planning. Asp to encourage diligence in chosen career of younger people.,4
"Great book, story and commentary!. Great book that breaks down greatness! You see that Outliers often have put in hours of behind the scenes work.",5
"another must read. Gladwell does it again. like always, everyone needs to read this book. and check their own reality, or understand the reality of people around them.",5
Book ordered. The book came in perfect condition. As it was a present for a friend I was delighted and would recommend this seller.,5
"Addictive!. If you are the type of person who enjoy books based on real facts, informative and clever, this is probably your type of book.",5
"Putting success into context. Very thoughtful read, encouraged me to think a little differently about how I see things",5
"Gladwell gives us more food for thought. As in ""Blink"" and his other books, Gladwell gives us a lot to think about, using a number of examples, this time including The Beatles, Bill Gates, and South Korean pilots. His basic thesis is that, while most successful people are smart and hardworking, the ""outliers"" are those who have been given the opportunity to work very hard and get the 10,000 hours of practice that is required to be very, very good at something.",5
"Malcolm Gladwell never fails to amaze. I love reading his books, but listening to him narrate his own is amazing!! It’s like one giant podcast, like revisionist history.",5
Great book!. I like how he changed my views on the outliers. It somehow gives hope to people who also wants to be successful and persuade them to grab every opportunities available to them.,5
"Perfect read. This book is a marvel. I loved Gladwell's hypothesis and enjoy reading the perspectives of a brilliant mind. Read to the end, the nice wrap makes this book even more special.",5
Great but sometimes ....... The book is beyond great and the research is mind blowing but sometimes it gets overwhelming but still a very nice book,5
Five Stars. Thank you for great book!,5
"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories. Christine Brown-Quinn,The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.",4
Five Stars. Great Read,5
Like research?. Like the science behind the information,5
"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",5
"Read it.. Now i need to find something i can invest 10,000 hours into.",5
Great listen. A great listen. It takes you on a journey of understanding into the stories behind how many well known people succeeded. Very interesting and sure to provide some enlightening conversations about the stories. Covers things from air crashes to ice hockey and maths in between. Highly recommend.,5
"Save your money. My review sums it up for you.. I’ll make it easy...you need 10k hours plus of practice at something to be great. You also need to be born at the beginning of the year, so that your age isn’t skipped by cut off dates. Finally, no matter your income, it’s all about who you know or what is available to you that others don’t have.",3
Outliers. Good book. Great insights. Great narrator. Thumbs up. I really would recommended it to anyone.,4
"Great!!!. This is a great book of examples and life chances, that were grasp by those who suceeded!",5
Great read. This book is a must for any young adult. The way everything is broken down and simplified is just incredible. I read this book in college and still continue to read it and give it as a gift to people.,5
"A Neat and Informative Body of Information. What an amazing book. For me the word outlier has a very mathematical meaning, being part of statistical analysis which I taught. It was interesting to see another dimension presented in the form of actual real life variables coming together to have profound affects on the lives of some very significant people. There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747). I can relate to the struggle to rise up in social rank. My mother's family were Irish transplants from the potato famine of the mid 1800s on one side, and a runaway to sea from the island of Mauritius on the other. Overall the level of academic excellence in this book and the quality of intellectual thought makes it a worthy read.",5
"Homework.... This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman. The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise. As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read. It’s always refreshing to review the information presented in this book. If you haven’t already, add this text to your library.",5
Must Read!. This book is part of a fantastic trilogy. Must read Blink and The Tipping Point....love Malcolm Gladwell.,5
Fantastically interesting and compelling book. I originally purchased the audible version of this book but I found it so compelling that I purchased a hard copy as well. It's easy to read and relevant to anyone. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
"Easy to read support for the truth that no one succeeds alone.. The author is easy to read. He divides the book into groups of factually similar individual stories that, in turn, cluster around a common theme. Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone. In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there. The book is an understated argument that raw talent is distributed evenly and that society would benefit if the opportunity for development was equally distributed.",5

"Outliers by Gladwell. This book sparked a very interesting discussion with a book group about the concept of an outlier. While Gladwell's information was interesting, it seemed to most of us to represent fairly common sense. However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it. Gladwell's book seemed narrow with respect to being almost exclusively American in nature and ignored so many that were in other places in the world and other times in history.",5
"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening. I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging. He was right. Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance. In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary. Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts. Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control. These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",5
Five Stars. Very good read,5
"Answers so many questions about success. This book has been an eye opener in many aspects; the examples presented, the detailed Revealed, the train of thought followed, all came together to enlighten me in very new ways and made me think of how to take advantage of my circumstance and create circumstances for my daughters.",5
Loved it!. Fascinating stories I've never heard before...I read it months ago and it resonates for a long time. I find myself thinking of the interesting tidbits in this book all the time.,5
"I highly recommend this book. The book provides incredible insights into the top-tier successes in our society. The information is incredibly insightful and thought provoking. So much so, that after I started reading Outliers, I did not put it down until I had finished it. It gave me a deeper understanding on how some influences in my childhood played a role in who I have grown up to be. I highly recommend this book.",5
everyone should read this book is word every page. this book teaches you a lot of the things you should know before they happends learn more and enjoy it,5
"I ordered two of them. Outstanding book for a high school student or above. Our MBA professor used some chapters from this book in our class; which was the first time I've read Gladwell; wished I would have had this class 20 years ago. By the book, and then by one for a friend.",5
Must listen. I’m a Gladwell fan but this book put so much into perspective for me. It helps me a lot with dealing with my teenage daughters and helping them to achieve their goals. I’m a believer in work ethic.,5
"Sensational Book!. The world fosters competition at an exponential pace and this read awards you with a perfect inspiration to be distinctive within that massive competition. Learning about The Beatles' outstanding success in the music industry to the advancement of Microsoft in the technical world, a journey through this books captivates you to find headstarts to the race of your success!",5
Great reas. I found this to be one of the best reads I've read in years. It's a good book with a lot of substance. Gladwell writes in a very simple style that is entertaining as well as very thought provoking.,4
"Excellent Read - a Social Scientist version of Freakonomics. Easy to read, insightful, and very very interesting!",5
"Fantastic listen!!. Can listen to this in one sitting or ""standing"" on a Saturday while working in the shop. So many great examples of outliers and how western society should adjust our views of those who have succeeded. Spoiler alert... It's more than just ....",5
Five Stars. great easy read!!!,5
"powerful. You won't be disappointed. It's easy to follow and masterfully tells stories of success while empowering the masses with knowledge of what it takes. Worth reading for 10,000 hours.",5
Fantastic book. I loved it. The way he shows how circumstances shaped the lives of succeeded people is amazing.,5
"everyone with a goal should read this. great read, very inspiring. Can relate and find little things to help you succeed.",5
El éxito depende de ti.. El libro es una excelente forma de confirmar que el éxito depende de cada persona y su entorno.,5
Five Stars. Great item,5
"Could be half as long. I did enjoy this book, but I found it a bear to finish. Gladwell starts to make his point in the first chapter and then just beats you over the head with it until the end. He is very thorough, to the point where I felt my intelligence was being insulted. Half way into the book o audibly said ""okay, I get it."" Less historical story telling and more application of his idea would have been great.",3
Nicely written about outliers. Very well written book covering many aspects in a outliers life. Nothing crazy exciting information in this book but well worth a read.,4
This is a great book. Great book,5
"Great Perspective based upon how you grew up. I enjoyed this book greatly, It answered the question - Is it just that people have all the money and then find a great idea? What's so much different than an ""urban"" kid vs a ""privileged"" kid. One part of the equation is exposure.",5
Five Stars. Love it,5
game changer. this book will change the way you look at life and success and accomplishments. it will have you examining not only your life but that of those around you and those you have idolized growing up. It makes you rethink how you approach things and if you have young children you will look at life through this outlier lens for them so that you can give them the best start possible.,5
"Greatness ""lies"".... Gladwell's Outliers speaks to a great divide that exists in our culture, in that we can all be successful if we take the given examples Gladwell lays out in this book. Only we've become so occupied in that only certain individuals are gifted, that we fail to see greatness in each person.",5
"I had to finish it to get it!. Some the stories bored me! Especially the Colombian pilot story (go figure). However, by the end, I understood the author's reasoning behind telling the biographies, successes and failures of all these people with different backgrounds, time in history and industries.",5
Really interesting text. Well written,5
Not bad. This book was really good. It jumped around from topic to topic but ultimately tired everything together. Highly recommended reading material.,5
"Fascinating. I enjoyed reading this book and it's study of the ""self made man""/genius myth very much. A fascinating insight drawn from the author's personal experience and background.",4
Awesome. Loved it. I'm now a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan.,5
Very facinating! A must read.. Gladwell continues to write great books!,5
just incredible. I was riveted by this book and the amazing stats used to back up the author's claims. It has made me think very differently about my own life and that of my young child's.,5
"A bit boring. I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book. To be honest it’s a bit boring and author goes around same subject again and again. We stoped reading midway through. I don’t know may be it is a matter of taste, but we didn’t like it.",2
"Very good. This is good. This is easy to listen to, well narrated. But good information which makes a lot of sense. I recommend all Audible listeners to definitely include this on their lists.",5
Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,4
"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",4
Cheese. Cheese,3
OUTSTANDING I Love Malcolm Gladwell. OUTSTANDING I Love Malcolm Gladwell. Exceptional,5
Good listen. Liked it...food for thought...Liked the authors voice and although it gets a little lengthy the message was worth it.,3
"Great read. Finding about the importance of the oportunities was amazing , the structure of the book helps a lot in having yo wanting to read it and finish it as soon as possible.",5
Hold them back!. Phenomenal book on why you should hold your kids back in school. :),5
"Awesome. great book that makes you think. interesting outlook and perspective on various life situtions. nice to see someone disprove the idea that success us ""luck"".",5
"learned something new. Gladwell helps to identify the ""conditions"" that contribute to above or way above average success in a range of activities. As usual, the content and narration are first rate.",4
"Great book. Loved it, very entertaining and knowledge driven! Must read for anyone! I highly recommend this book!",5
Awesome read. Brilliantly written....,4
Enjoyable Book; Don't full-heartedly agree with underpinning generalization. PROs,4
"Great Book. What makes the best and brightest of people become successful? Outliers: The Story of Success is one of the most intriguing and eye opening books I have read in quite some time.  Malcolm Gladwell attempts to dissect the reason behind success in multiple real life situations. I found myself amazed at some of the things I read and have a new definition of what success really is in my own mind. This book will appeal any age group as there is much to learn through stories of others. Gladwell made it clear to me that people are not born &amp;ldquo;with it.&amp;rdquo; Could it be possible that the time of year that someone is born has a direct correlation to the best hockey players in the world? The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches."" Not only does this book focus on individuals but stereotypes being answered such as Asians being good at math. Have you ever thought of what makes the people around you more successful? With lots of research and thoughtful thinking Gladwell has been able to dig deep and bring answers to these questions through this interesting book. Must read",5
"Great Book. Well worth the read, it's got some good information and is presented in an easy way.",5
"A read to remember. The beauty of Outliers is it's detailing. Malcolm Gladwell take you through a journey a amazing revelations with analysis, data, history. The way each of his ideas unfold is mind-blowing. The chapters that involves plane crashes, asian maths, the 10000 hour rule, concerted cultivation are something to ponder on for a long time.",5
"The effect of circumstance. Great perspective on how life's circumstances have as much to do with success as IQ. It is a confirmation that being aware and taking advantage of opportunities that might easily be taken for granted, can change the path of a person's life 180 degrees.",5
This audiobook is outstanding! it's an outlier!. Once I started listening to it I could not stop. It gave me some explainations I wondered and neaded. I normally listen to my audio player when I am walking. Sometimes listen to music sometimes to audiobooks. But when I stated this one I just wanted to walk all the time with this audiobook.,5
Worth talking about. The subjects and stories spur discussions with co-workers and friends that continue as new readers join the conversation. The insights are thought provoking and coincidences surprising. I found it fun to read and difficult to put down. Any book that is talked about on a regular basis is better than most. It may no be life changing but it will certainly give you a new perspective on success and who is successful.,5
Four Stars. I think every child should read this book.,4
Wonderful book and great theory on education.. One of the best books I have read. I recommended it to several friends. I found the maturation difference between children born in October and those born in August; both entering kindergarten in September was something I never considered prior to reading Outliers.,5
"A book packed with interesting and unusual information. After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.",5
"Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined .... Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined my interpretation of what it means to be human, and what it takes for a person to thrive and be successful. The book takes the reader through a series of stories and scenarios that prove that natural talent doesn’t necessarily exist. In fact, the characteristics that define who we are and how we act stem from a huge underground network that includes what time of the year we were born, our heritage, and other things. For example, the country in which we grew up correlates to our confidence when standing up to authority. Americans are inherently unafraid of the distance between a powerful figure and a subordinate, while people of nations such as Russia don’t normally speak up against those more powerful than them. opics like these are openly explored in ""Outliers"" in a clever blend of storytelling and statistics. Sometimes I was reading a novel, other times a book on psychology, and even at times, a book that would be right at home in the self-help section. ""Outliers"" is fast-paced yet descriptive and never caught me lacking focus and attention while reading it, especially considering that nonfiction books easily become very dry and difficult for me to read. However, ""Outliers"" tackles such a unique idea and approaches it in a way that gives the book immense reread value. After finishing the book, I’ve been inspired to look further into some of the researchers and studies the book referenced throughout. I believe that the best books are the ones that keep you thinking even after you’ve finished them, and there is no doubt that ""Outliers"" is extremely thought-provoking. While some chapters were more interesting and relevant to me than others, otherwise, it’s really difficult for me to find flaws with this book. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to know more about the inner workings of the world and even about themselves. ""Outliers"" provides unique insight on the natural tendencies of man and why successful people are so, also influencing the reader to evaluate how they, themselves, can thrive.",5
"Great Read!. Phenomenal book! Would recommend to family, friends, and colleagues. I am eager to read Tipping Point and Daivd and Goliath.",5
Enjoying the book.. Its an interesting read. And I have enjoyed the authors concept.,5
"Important, interesting, and thought-provoking book. In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell explores how hidden advantages and opportunities play a role for people who've achieved extraordinary success. He looks at how cultural legacies shape the patterns of our behavior and that when and where you are born matters.",4
Engaging and thought provoking read. A well written and engaging book that makes you think about people's achievements in a different light. It causes you to consider the external influences that have and might shape success.,5
Another way of looking at the world. Another fascinating book by Malcolm Gladwell who manages to see what the rest of us see but to analyze it in an entirely new light. Worth the read.,5
Here is my animated review!,4
Great book. Great book,5
Not For me!. just because it happened once it doesn't mean it must happen again . I don't believe that because your good at seeing and finding patterns you can predict the future.,2
"Five Stars. Item delivered on time, was as described",5
Amazing Book. This is an amazing book full of wisdom and insight. Plenty of thought provoking knowledge.,5
Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I love this book. I've recommend it to anyone who loves the little known details in life that have really big impact. I would have given 6 stars it they were available.,5
Graceffa. Wow,5
Good. Good,4
"Mesmerizing!. I had purchased this book some time ago and, having put it aside for some long forgotten reason, picked it up again thanks to a friends passing comment about it. Thank God for that, because I now agree with my friend's observation that Gladwell is ""the best story teller of them all"".",5
"It's not just luck...or brains for that matter!. Malcolm Gladwell has done it again! In Outliers, he combines culture context, behavioral psychology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize some of the enigma behind what creates success. A highly engaging read and a great way to understand the apparent contradictions established by typical rags-to-riches stories and the limitations of intellectual parameters of success.",5
Excellent book. Would highly recommend.. Excellent book. Would highly recommend.,5
"Great book!. What a wonderfully insightful book! I'm not a big reader, but I loved reading this one. I would suggest every parent and all teachers to read this.",5
