1,"Not What I Expected. Although a few of the stories were interesting, I was lead to believe there were more interesting life stories told.",0
2,"Outliers - Gladwell - A Good Tour of the Outer End of Normality. I read the book as it is on a reading list for my job. It is an easy read and I caution you about the actual science behind it; we readers just swallow some things without checking. However, it is, like many of his books, a good tour of the subject and worthy of our time.",1
3,Surprisingly good..... .. Interesting connections one wouldn't imagine are explained.,1
4,Success. Good book to read for success,2
5,"Interesting but I disagree.. The books provides a lot Marco and Micro examples of how circumstances produce “outliers” (great ppl). I agree whole heartily that is part of what makes anyone great is the family, opportunities, culture, community they grew up in. We all stand the shoulders of giants. But we also choose to work har and take risks where many could have but chose not to. I believe being self made is a choice someone makes, but their is a lot luck with no fault of your which allows you to choose to be self made. For example have a stable home, going to a good school, having a good mentor etc.",0
6,"I HAVE PROBLEMS NOT FULLY ANSWERED. The description, one chapter after the other, to describe an Outlier as one beyond the ordinary. In fact the stories are about ordinary people who took advantage of circumstances beyond their control. This is something ANYONE can do BY using whatever talents given to us. The point is learn your role and play it to the fullest. Each of us does not need to be an Einstein or a Beethoven 4 stars .",1
7,food for thought. Great read! Thought provoking.,2
8,"EYE OPENER. An amazing theory, well presented, that there are more factors involved in individual success than are usually thought. When, where, how we came to Earth gives some people advantages without the obvious reasons of being born into wealth, being a genius, or gifted athletically. Backed up with research and statistics, it's a new window into why some people are more successful than most.",2
9,"Definitely worth buying. This was the first book I bought for my Kindle. Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses. But this book was different. Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times. It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help. Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family. I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had. It was all there. The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated. This is one book that I want in my library, as a keeper - as opposed to ones that I wish I could give back.",1
10,"All I hear is someone complaining. One of the worst books I’ve read. Instead of looking into why people are outliers, the author complains the entire book.",0
11,"Makes a person think. Great book. Not your typical book about success, but it does make a person question a lot about our society.",2
12,"Outstanding people work very hard to achieve excellence and there are other factors necessary for success.. This is one of my favorite books. He researched qualities of outstanding individuals in different fields and tells what led to their success. Interesting examples, well-written book.",2
13,Highly recommended. I very much enjoyed this book. For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line. This book however brought home to me how much other unique (unique to them and their time) factors contributed greatly to their success. The stories about hockey players and how the slight difference in age gives the slightly older boy tremendous advantage were particularly enlightening.,1
14,"Enriching!. It was a very enlightening experience, reading the book. A worthwhile read, time well spent. I like the thorough research and conclusions reached.",1
15,"A quick read. I found this to be a very interesting view on success and successful people. The author has a very unique way of bringing forth the 'right time-right place' expression. He also provided amazing visuals within his stories, and the differences between how we are raised and where we come from. Please do remember, that having old, family money or looking good still has its advantages.",1
16,"Great!!. I love this book! I think that if you like to read about not just a wow story....but, what might be behind the wow....the 'quick' rises to fame and money etc....this book is for you. It proves that anyone can be an 'outlier'....I think it is a well thought out book and a quick read! I highly recommend!",2
17,"The Story of Other Peoples Success. Let me summarize for you: you need to have been born in a certain year to be successful. The end. Prob my fault, but I thought this was a self-hep book, rather it’s just a collection of stories of people who are successful because of the specific year they were born.",0
18,"ended up being very good. So insightful. Had to get this for class, ended up being very good. So insightful, has lots of interesting information and things to think about.",2
19,Four Stars. Interesting and thought-provoking - good read and I've used the stuff from this book in my real world.,1
20,Really good. Gladwell is a great author. His style is great and so is his information. Great book.,2
21,Three Stars. gift,0
22,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement. This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,2
23,"A different way of thinking. Gladwell has made quite a name for himself with this book and his thoughts. The main message is clear, there are extenuating circumstances in ever outcome in life. He looks at how the month you were born in really affects your ability to play top notch hockey (it makes a big difference), That in and of itself may not be a big issue for you, but, by inference it may influence when you try to have children and the impact on them scholastically. I don't generally read non-fiction. This is well written and made me sit back and think about a lot of things.",2
24,"Limited review. This is a limited review since the book arrived today itself. Going by the ""Tipping Point"" by the same authoe, I hope it lives to its name and hype.",1
25,"not drinking the cool-aid. I just did not find this book that compelling, much less convincing. The author is a master at taking a series of observations and making a circumstantial case for a point, but then never critically assessing whether his assertions are correct by looking at them in some objective manner. The hypothesis is that there are random but predictable factors control our fate. So here is the problem. It is easy to look retrospectively and say, Bill gates is who he is because someone bought a computer for his 8th grade class which gave him a unique opportunity. So if that purchase was the key for bill, what happened to all his classmates and why don't we know anything about them. Another hypothesis is that its really the extent to which you practise that determines your outcome, so really successful musicians are there because they practiced more over the years. Umm, but what led them to practise so much more at an early age? The author acts like he has solved the nature vs. nurture; argument, but it is not so simple. Then ther is the statements that once you reach a certain basic level of height for basketball players or intelligence for the rest of us, that additional height or intelligence does not matter. Umm, why do BB players get measured to the millimeter at pre-NBA draft camps, and why does their stock fall if a player is found to only be 6-6, instead of 6-8, and why are there so many slow relatively clumsy 7-0 white guys sitting on rosters if height above 6-2 does not matter.",0
26,Like. I liked that this book gave a perception of that what an outlier is and also made us feel encouraged that each of us has a distinct purpose.,2
27,"A must read!. Eye opening relative revelations about age, demographics, religion, timing and luck as contributors toward success But, the common denominator is hard work. This is a great read, especially if you have young children because a parent can influence their child's success.",2
28,"A decent read. This book was well written with good examples and ideas. I enjoyed the way the author discussed the various cultures and their histories, giving the reader an insight into the hidden truths of success.",1
29,Five Stars. Excellent read!! I'm keeping this for my collection!! Definitely a worthy purchase!,2
30,Most inspirational story. This is one of the greatest and most inspiring books I've ever read. Can't say enough of about the amazing perspectives from this story. Many people both successful and not could learn a lot from a book like this.,2
31,"Not so. Outliers is a fun/interesting read. But it needs to be taken with a great deal of salt.........I just checked for the hell of it the birthdays of both hockey teams Canada and US, who just finished the Vancouver Olympics. Mr. Gladwell remarks regarding this topic is utterly false. One does NOT have to be born in Jan. or Feb. to succeed in hockey. The star Sydney Crosby was born on Aug.7th, Brooks Orpik Sept.26th, Ryan Miller July 17th, Marc Andre Fleury Nov.28th, and a famous "" oldie "" Mario Lemieux Oct.5th.........And the list goes on.......",0
32,"Not a perfect book. There are some great concepts in this book. However, I do not agree with all of the research supposedly backing these concepts. Sloppy research with few counterarguments. I wish there was more in that regard. Read it if you are deep into self development. Everyone internalizes things differently. You may reach an essentially revelation for your own respective life.",1
33,Excellent and Refreshing Look at Research and Hidden Stories and Trends. Excellent book. Had many principles I was able to look at in more depth after for graduate work. He makes some very interesting points about how outliers in data analysis and observation can actually be potentially new trends or tell the story for which the researcher is really looking. He talks about the 10K hour rule and how successes can be discovered. Classic Malcolm Gladwell. I've read it several times now.,2
34,"a call to action and recognition of what factors mark the success of great individuals. Gladwell. In the novel, Outliers: A Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell tells various stories of success, that in a way, is manifestation, a call to action and recognition of what factors mark the success of great individuals. Gladwell, shows his findings and theory of what he thinks actually constitutes the success of greats like Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and others from a lens that though might seem obvious is many times ignored due to the common notion and praise we give to achieving things from individual merit. With the use of his title, “Outliers,” he provides an outline, or better yet a lens, into what makes outliers—outstanding individuals, or something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body—successful in the end. What many used to and still can argue is due to true talent and hard work, may be caused by a random array of circumstances that if taken advantage of are the true propeller towards success.",1
35,"Heard it was good, found it disjointed and didn't agree with many of his conclusions. Enjoyed the first few chapters but lost all interest half way through. Seemed fairly disjointed with not much organization. I disagree with some of his conclusions, and feel he has found cases that fit his theory, but thrown out others that do not.",0
36,"One of the best books I read in 2012. Malcolm Gladwell is brilliant! And the way he looks at things really makes you rethink your thinking. You wonder why you ""missed it"" for so long! It is a joyfully wonderful book. Why the people at the top are really there---10,000 hours.",2
37,Five Stars. My son loves it.,2
38,Agree to disagree.. Agree to disagree. Full of contradictions on explaining outcomes yet always defaults to collectivist solutions in hopes of utopia. Story telling is exhausting.,0

40,"Painfully Boring!!!. My opinion is that the author came up with an idea of what made some people successful and then ""backed into"" the supporting evidence. He is extremely redundant and downright boring at times. His opinions could have been summed up in a 10 page book.",0
41,Outliers. Love Malcolm Gladwell! This book arrived quickly and as described.,2
42,great read!. I always recomend this book to my friends. Malcolm Gladwell is such an interesting man and his style of writing allows for his ideas/theories to be cohesive and easily understandable.,2
43,"Very interesting and enjoyable to read.. I really enjoyed reading this book. Malcolm Gladwell includes many interesting case studies in this book, which are fascinating to read about. It is also very entertainingly written. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about what makes some people successful but not others.",2
44,"so worth the read!. An amazing book that really makes you think. Buy it and read it now, trust me you wont regret your move!",2
45,"You can do it too!. A remarkable exposition of how very successful people get to their stratospheric levels. People like Bill Gates. Gladwell makes it clear that these people were not only talented and hard working, but well connected and fortunate to be born at certain times in certain cultures. Should you find yourself outside of this success loop, I recommend you next read Seth Godin's",1
46,Four Stars. So happy to have finally received this book. My only issue is that the cover is bent.,1
47,"Examination. Outliers is an exceptional examination of society as a whole - the narratives and stories we tell ourselves to identify why some in society and others have-not. The simple explanation is totally obvious and not what we would have instinctively thought. Success has nothing to do with talent, it has everything to do with the built-in advantages society, family, community, cultures give that person to make them who they are.",2
48,Five Stars. Great book!,2
49,Novel ideas!. I'm glad I finally got to read this book! Gladwell's ideas are very original and nicely articulated. The book is well structured and supplements each idea with examples and studies. Nice work!,2
50,Weird?. This book states so many different facts and theories that make you think twice about certain things barely even crossed your mind before. I do not know if the facts that these people try to prove to you are really real or not but in a weird way they all make sense. It was just okay in my part though.,0
51,Five Stars. Quick delivery and a great book to read.,2
52,"A Passel of Quotable Insights. Malcolm Gladwell is a captivating writer who looks at the world through a different lens than you and I. My wife and I read this book, and it has sparked numerous interesting discussions.",2
53,"Outliers. In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell relates the success of hockey players, software programmers, the Beatles, geniuses, Jewish-American lawyers, pilots, Asians, and underprivileged students to being in the right place at the right time, receiving special opportunities, and working hard. According to Gladwell, outliers are ""products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is...grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luck"" (285). In my opinion, Gladwell shows that outliers are not all that different from other people at the start of their careers. They are just lucky enough to come across certain opportunities throughout their lives that bring them success. In fact, Gladwell believes that outliers are not really outliers at all. ""The Matthew Effect"" is one of my favorite chapters. Throughout the chapter, Gladwell uses statistical analysis to show that athletic and educational age cut-offs greatly affect one's success. Older children in the cut-offs seem to show more ""talent"" than those who are younger, but that is only because they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. As a result, the older children are given special opportunities, which accumulate and bring success. I also like ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" In this section, Gladwell explains that Asians are better at math because of their language and culture. He presents many valid points. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more logical than Western languages so Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than their American counterparts. Once again, this initial advantage results in an ""accumulative advantage,"" in which Asians like math more, try harder, and perform better. Although I agree with most of his arguments, Gladwell excludes any information that contradicts his points. For example, any sports fan can probably list famous athletes who were born right before the cutoff date. I personally know successful people who are the youngest on their team or in their class. I also know of non-Asian people who are excellent at math. Albert Einstein was European, yet he is remembered as a genius of mathematics and physics. Unfortunately, Gladwell does not include any of these exceptions to his rules in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading Gladwell's book. Although some of the chapters moved slowly, it was a fast read overall. Gladwell's stories encouraged me to look at success from a different perspective. Living in the United States, I have been reminded all of my life about the ""American dream"" and told that as long as I work hard, I will be successful. However, as Gladwell theorizes, hard work is not the only determinant of success.",1
54,Bounce now outliers. Another fascinating insight into the story of success. I first read Bounce which roused my curiosity on success and now Outliers further provides evidence that hard work and a great amount of luck can determine future success. As a teacher and sports coach these two books have had a profound affect on my thinking and therefore my work.,2
55,Five Stars. Fabulous service really great products thank you,2
56,Intersting at its worst moments. I found the book very hard to put down and very good from the start. Very fascinating to say the least.,2
57,"What month were you born ? -a surprising analysis of high achievers. Malcolm Gladwell has taken a remarkably broad approach to try to identify if there any factors in common between 'OUTLIERS' - people whose achievements lie well beyond the normal range. His studies are as diverse as Mozart, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. He looks at football teams and ""geniuses"". His conclusions are unexpected but compelling - lateral thinking which surprises and entertains. I couldn't stop quoting bits and recommending this book to all my friends - it may not change your life but it will give you a new insight into some possible precursors for outstanding achievement. It's an easy read - I really couldn't put it down!",2
58,"Five Stars. Malcolm's ""One, two three and a puff of smoke"" is always pithy, entertaining and informative.",2
59,"I didn't like the disguised propaganda chapter on Bill Gates. I skipped a few chapters, it was an ok read, kind of long. I didn't like the disguised propaganda chapter on Bill Gates. Don't believe his version at all. If anyone knows the history of the banking class who now control the world and the world's money, they would not skip the fact that Gates comes from this class. The PC revolution was not his doing solely, and it was probably planned. His family has been in Eugenics. His foundation disguises their real goal by putting on the face of philanthropy. I bet you this author is also one of the 'fake Jews' - if you notice, too much of our media content comes from fake Jews.",0

63,"Fun anecdotal book which gives pause for thought.. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell, though find it important to take his writing for what it is: as an inspiration to think along his lines. His books tend to be somewhat drawn out, with long anecdotes to support his claims. Although somewhat tedious at times, they serve to help the reader remember his key points.",1

67,"Certainly Makes You Think About Success. You will never look at someone who says they are self made the same way again. I have always been a great believer in fate...but thinking in Outlier terms, there is definitely more at play that simple fate. Factors that are simply out of your control are more determinate than your own decisions and efforts...take nothing away from those as well.",1
68,"Gladwell always delivers a unique take. I’ve listened to or read most of his books and they all strike at something that ripples under the surface of reality and guides humanity as a whole or individually. He narrates his own book extremely well. I’ve heard him on a lot of podcasts and he is great speaking in general, but also reads very well.",1
69,Great book from an excellent author. I love this book it shows the mechanics of success and really gets you thinking about your own successes and how to ensure your families success in the future,2
70,"Average book. It's not average in terms of other books, but I've read much better from Gladwell. Would recommend nonetheless based on merit of ideas",0
71,Will We Change Our Ways?. Malcolm Gladwell shows an number of ways we can improve the way we educate. We can easily increase the number of gifted students. Will we? He also shows how to eliminate the education gap between privileged students and under privileged students. Will we? Or will we just sit by and go with the status quo?,1
72,Five Stars. Great book!,2
73,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful.... I really enjoyed the diverse fields and examples from which Gladwell draws to make his points. I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York). Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds. Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct. Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis. A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",1
74,Good read. Interesting stories. Makes for good conversation. It is just what you would expect from Malcolm Gladwell. Glad I read it.,1
75,First time. This is my first Gladwell book. It was OK. My friend recommended this book to me. The idea is intriguing but the style of writing did not resonate with me. Interesting observations.,0
76,Five Stars. Excellent!,2
77,Must read for anyone interested in understanding human psychology and business.. Great book and an easy read. Gladwell is a very good writer and his words just jump off the page. A must read as are the other books he has penned.,2
78,Dull. Not sure what all the hype was about... Didn't keep my interest past the 2nd chapter,0

""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell is a well-written collection of studies into several areas of human activities from hockey players to air traffic controllers examining why some persons excel and others fail. While some of the author's analyses and conclusions may be open to debate, he has obviously done considerable scholarly research into a wide variety of subjects and has presented his material in a higly-readable manner.",1
83,Good way to kill a couple of days at lake reading book. Was interesting read,2
84,"A great story of how certain people succeed.. I loved how this book started out and identified what ""Outliers"" are and what made them that way, for instance, Bill Gates is an outlier because of the circumstances that existed that made it possible for him to succeed.",1
85,"Keen observations, well presented. I found this book highly interesting and entertaining. It reads very well and is a true page turner.",1
86,Important factors for people's success or non-success revealed.. This book provides a whole new outlook on how some people become successful and others don't. I read it quite a while ago and can still relate the message it contains to the success or lack thereof of people I know - even including myself.,2
87,Worth the read. All of Gladwell's books are thought provoking and insightful. Highly recommend.,2
88,Very good. This is a very good book that presents a very intresting theory. Just remeber it is a theory. It does not explain everyone:).,1
89,Interesting. I liked some of the insights and suggestions to deal with the revelations exposed in the book. It was eye opening and enjoyable.,1
90,boring book. I felt like he could say what he wanted to say in half an hour. The book basically talks about same things over and over. We know all this. Nothing new and nothing that will enrich my life.,0
91,"Ignoring the ""outliers"". Malcolm Gladwell calculates and and analyzes statistics that create a norm for the very successful; the outliers in society. The problem is that many parents are so abuzz with these patterns that they are attempting to make successes out of their children. (Darn shame happiness doesn't get factored in) Gladwell does not present statistics or examples of outliers of his formulas, of which I'm certain there are many. So this is an interesting but simplistic presentation. It is enjoyable reading. But as you read, consider the outliers of his formulas!",0
92,"Not what I expected. So, it seems that people that have success were just in the right moment, raised by the right family and were born at the appropriate time. Even the mother of the author. I can agree in some of the points made by the author; yes, those people were in certain circumstances that they took advantage of and bum! Success was the consequence. So, if you just want to hear the stories of these people and what circumstances surrounded them to be successful then go ahead and buy the book. But, and here is a breaking point, if you want to learn something of these stories to apply it to your own life and maybe also be successful, then that’s another different story, the book won’t provide it to you so easily. You have to interpret it. My interpretation is that you have to be aware of your own “circumstances”, your strengths and your advantages that life provides you, and you have to be able to take advantage of them. That’s it. If you are blind to those advantages or circumstances that you have, then you won’t catch them and you won’t be successful or don’t as successful as you could be. So open your eyes. Be aware and know what time you are living, and “see” what you have in your favor. I am not sure that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs were aware or what they have in their hands and they consciously took advantage at that time…maybe after 30 years they were able to see it, but well, that’s another discussion.",0
93,Gladwell always a must read. Very easy reading and brings together all the those things you could see but couldn't quite put your finger on.,2
94,"Bringing light to what ought to be obvious but isn't. Interesting, thought provoking and easy to read but also feels a little facile.",1

99,"Not entirely wrong.. It's almost too obvious that Mr. Gladwell made his conclusion before starting to write this book. I think he makes a great analysis, and the bit about Culture is very interesting.

101,"Gladwell Again Connects the Most Remote Dots to Chart the Extraordinary Success of a Chosen Few. Both a keen eye for shrewd observation and a sure grasp on historical evidence serve author Malcolm Gladwell fruitfully in this fascinating look at people who appeared at first to be ""outliers"" compared to mainstream society only to find themselves at the pinnacle of their fields through a symbiotic combination of talent, vision and intelligence. What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart.

102,"000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. In my opinion, all of the teenagers should read this book.

He showed how important to work your 10.000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. You can be born a genius, but you'd accomplish nothing, if you won't work hard, but if you are working hard and long hours, the success would come to you. I appreciate meticulous, hard job Malcolm Gladwell put in this book.",2
103,Super inspiring. What a wonderful book.,2
104,"Fascinating, Fascinating, Fascinating. I read Malcolm Gladwell's ""BLINK - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking"" and enjoyed it very much!! I chose ""Outliers"" just to read something else by this author. I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one. I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered. Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception. I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe. I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later. You won't be sorry.",1
105,It's a good book.. It's a good book. A different perspective for sure. Sometimes the author will do a little bit of stretching but I believe it was important so he coudl get his point across. Worth reading.,1

112,"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",0

121,Highly recommended. Excellent,2
122,"Brash and oversimplified. About the only good thing I can say about this book is that it was a quick read. The author takes complicated issues, boils them down, and only looks at them through the perspective of his already-determined hypothesis, and removes all nuance the issues.",0
123,Four Stars. Interesting and very different.,1
124,"The sin of self regard. The subtitle could have been ""The Sin of Self Regard"". Much of who we are consist of factors completely out of our control, birth month, birth year, ethnic background and other such items. Gladwell is an expert at explaining a theme by using anecdotal stories and explaining the results by looking at the story from a different perspective.",1

127,"Gladwell's Usual Thoroughness. I am always impressed by the thoroughness of Malcolm Gladwell's research and ability to convey that into enjoyable, and insightful reading. This book attempts to convey the story behind the genius that often highlights successful people by breaking the reasons for their success down.",2
128,"Its a great book, with great ideas that are worthy of examination and discussion.. Loved this book. Gladwell does an excellent job of communicating his ideas to the reader. Each chapter can stand on its own, but many of them lend support to following chapters (giving you several ""Ah hah!"" moments).",2
129,"Outliers. Not just a book, thought provoking and challenging especially if you have kids! What opportunities are you creating for them and what plays to their advantage naturally due to the factors discussed in the book? There are doubters out there who disagree with some of the concepts which is understandable, that's what the book is meant to do - make you question!",2
130,Slightly disappointed. the quality of book is not so good and also old one. I always received good quality books from flipkart bt this book not upto the standard.,0
131,"escucha primero la entrevista. Al principio no entendía el por que del relato, la entrevista le da más sentido",1
132,"Another way to interpret data. The material in this book is interesting because it looks at data and puts a different interpretation on facts: Why crime rates are falling, the success of different cultural groups and why language rules makes some learning easier, etc. I especially enjoy listening to Malcolm Gladwell read his books--this is the third of his I've listened to. I plan to listen to all of them, his insights are noteworthy and his performance makes listening so soothing.",1

134,"Thought provoking and very interesting. Reading this book has lead to a lot of reflection about myself, how I view others, and how I want to raise my children. As a Christian, it has helped to affirm the fact that we have little to no control over what happens to us, and that every success we have in life should be attributed to God.",1

136,Fascinating!. It really is an education on how to broaden your way of thinking.,2
137,"Inspiring and interesting. I have been quoting this book to friends on several occasions since finishing it. Or rather, since beginning to listen to it! I think that says a lot. It inspired me in the same kind of way as Freakonomics did when I read it a number of years ago. There is more reasoning in Outliers and it is more down to earth but there are similarities in how theories and models are applied to the things we all can relate to.",1
138,"Luck Not Strategy. This is a fascinating read, although not what I expected. r. Gladwell throws a lot of facts and figures, only to be told that luck may be more common than not, toward success. This was a disappointment to me and may be to others as I was hoping to find new strategies regarding success as an entrepreneur. n a nutshell, if I am in the right place at the right time, through no necessary knowledge on my part, I will get pay dirt.",0
139,"A Must Read. This is an excellent book and highly recommended for those that want to get a clear picture of how some succeed and other do not. The author points out that many factors come into play for success how ever one may define success. Success is sometime a matter of chance circumstance, rather than hard work.",2
140,"I'm Surprised This Book Is So Highly Reviewed. This book seems to me like a direct ripoff of the idea of Freakonomics. The only difference is that it's not as interesting. The book is supposed to be about identifying what creates success. The author sets out to prove that most traits of a successful person are not of their own doing but of cultural or lucky circumstances. The only point that I really like is the 10,000 hour rule which basically states that you can be an expert in something if you practice it for 10,000 hours.",0
141,Boring and Random. Not nearly as good as I was expecting. Book doesn't really seem to stay on topic and there is no cohesion between chapters. I really had to force myself to finish reading it.,0
142,"... few of Malcolm Gladwells other books - this didnt disappoint, well worth a read. Ive read Blink and wanted to try a few of Malcolm Gladwells other books - this didnt disappoint, well worth a read.",2
143,Four Stars. Great book! Malcolm always delivers a good read.,1
144,"Good but not what I was expecting. *Edit* I would recommend listening to the end interview first. It put the book more into a perspective i wish i had during the book. As I said in my comment below that the book is very respectable and brings up very interesting ""Coincidences"" that relate to background and circumstance.",0
145,"Great Read, Faded Pages. Several pages were faded beyond the point of being legible. It's worst on page 245 for me, shame the return date just passed.",0
146,"Intriguing but the research is questionable. This book is quite intriguing, but often as I listened I began to wonder about his research methodology. His facts, while compelling seem to be only part of the picture and I began to wonder as to how much picking and choosing of facts was going on to support his points. His determination to support his rather deterministic view is clear throughout the piece.",0
147,"A Classic from an Original Thinker. A master of his craft, Gladwell is a genius - he looks at things so differently to us mere mortals. Surprising he has not won more accolades, but then genius is an undervalued trait in our society these days",1
148,Four Stars. Great book!,1
149,"Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!. “Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point. Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it. If you’re willing to really analyze the content, it could definitely leave an impact on your life. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious and enjoys reading material that challenges them to think critically.",2
150,"I did not know that .... Read this book, as ever Gladwell sees behind the glitz of reported genius to show much is structural and the 10,000 hours applied to Bill Gates and The Beatles shows how they were ready to take up the opportunity which came their way. If you do not read this you will miss an opportunity for yourself.",2
151,"Fun reading, interesting conclusions, but lacking credibility. Coincidentally, I read the chapter about the relative ages of hockey players while I was watching the Chicago Blackhawk beat the Detroit Red Wings in game 7 of the western finals. I thought ""wow this is an amazing insight!"" However, after a quick check of the birth dates for the players I found Malcolm's conclusion to be bunk. Contrary to the book, there is an almost even distribution of birth months for the team members I checked multiple years and countries of origin just to be sure that I hadn't discovered another ""Outlier"". After this discovery,I have to call into question all that I have read from him. Maybe the book should be renamed to ""Outliars!""",0
152,"Five Stars. Delivered on time and as advertised, would purchase again.",2
153,"Excellent!. Awesome, very informative and fun, easy to read and very powerful arguments to change the way we educate ourselves and our children",2
154,"Are you an outlier? Read this to find out!. This is a very interesting read. His perspectives about when and where you were born are fascinating. Practice and hard work are very important to succeed in life, but the luck of your heritage play a much larger part than most would believe. Malcolm Gladwell's own story is proof of this.",2
155,Xmas gift for son-in-law. Xmas gift and it was on his list so am sure he will be pleased,2
156,"Definitely food for thought. In my English class we are exploring the question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" It's an interesting question, and Gladwell's book, Outliers answers it well. The book offers incredible insight on success and why people, not just outliers, are the way they are. The theme ""success is the result of a person's upbringing and opportunities"" is laced throughout the book. A person may have an IQ of 160, but this does not guarantee success. Yes, Bill Gates had incredible natural abilities, but it was because the school he attended had a high-tech computer room that he achieved success. Gladwell's own mother owes her success to being in the right place at the right time-she obtained a scholarship in Jamaica, and had she been born 3 or 4 years earlier that opportunity would not have existed. Time and place do not just influence a person, they define him. ne chapter of Outliers I found particularly interesting was Rice Paddies and Math Tests. Being of Asian descent, many people have stereotyped me, commenting that I must be good at math or really smart. What's interesting about Gladwell is that he does not try to deny the claim or apologize for it-he justifies it. Many Asians actually are good at math, but it is not because they have more intelligence; it has to do with being raised in a culture where patience and perseverance determine whether a family will have food to eat. I do agree that Asians, as well as any other ethnic group, have different cultures and perceptions of success. Gladwell's book is one huge generalization, and it has to be. But I find it interesting that I am of Asian and European descent, and my father's family, who is white, has much higher standards than my mother's. ladwell claims that a person will become an expert at something, anything, after devoting 10000 hours to the cause. It makes me think, Will someone who spends 10,000 hours playing soccer but does not put in maximum effort be more successful than a player who dedicates 5000 hours of blood, sweat and tears to becoming great? Can someone become an expert before the 10000 hour mark? I agree that time is important to become good at anything. My band teacher always says, ""Practice does not make perfect; practice makes permanent"". So will a clarinet player who plays poorly for 10,000 hours become an expert awful clarinet player? ladwell brought up an interesting point in the chapter The Trouble with GeniusesPt. 2. Chris Langan is a genius but never lives to his full potential. He drops out of college and ends up leading a happy yet conventional life. Robert Oppenheimer, on the other hand is not as smart as Langan, yet his perseverance and social skills make him one of the most successful and revolutionary men in the world. It makes me think, Are people wasting their abilities? Some of my peers are extremely intelligent, but do not have a spectacular work ethic. Given perseverance, they could all do great things, but many do not want to. Should they be pushed and forced to succeed? Is it more important to do whatever makes you happy? Outliers accredits many third parties with determining other people's successes, but to what extent does a person himself define his success? utliers was definitely food for thought. I t changed my perceptions of the world and success. I recommend this book to anyone who questions, Why? constantly and although the information may not be ground-breaking and extreme, it is thought-provoking.",1
157,Four Stars. Very interesting ideas!,1
158,"Food for Thought... and Action. I really enjoyed and benefited from this eye opening, thought provoking work By Malcolm Gladwell. Outliers points out how the environment of one's family, and/or community invariably influences one's potential for mega success. It provokes me to heighten my awareness and purposefulness to expand opportunity for greater circles as well as for my most immediate circle. he book stimulated me to consider strategies I might employ to facilitate my continued growth and success as well. It can do the same for you. It certainly offers insights that could lead to crafting a legacy for those you love. If you have a dream and a powerful work ethic, your potential for success is multiplied by the culture that surrounds you. While we may not choose our birth circumstance, we can certainly immerse ourselves in the world of our passions. The sooner the better. It all makes since.",1
159,"Really interesting. Taught me how success depends on opportunities, and one's willingness to after them. We are all capable of great success, but we have to be willing to work for it.",1
160,Good quality product. Thank you very much for delived my product and I very happy for that and I just want to say one thing when ever I order something from you're side just send on my exactly house no so that it's very easy for me without any confusion...over all everything is fine onces again thank you very much,1
161,Book. Excelent!,2
162,"Disappointment. I had higher expectations due to all the hype surrounding this book. The narrative is incoherent, he jumps from one topic to another in a seemingly random assortment of stories only to end with some sort of a anti-racism statement as conclusion.",0
163,Another way of seeing.. My 16 year old grandson was asked to read this over the summer. I read it in order to talk with him about it. I thought the first 1/2 was the most applicable for a teenager and I enjoyed that part the best. I look forward to some discussion once he has also read it. I am an MSW and always am intrigued by this type of book that takes a new way of seeing human accomplishment.,1
164,Ingredients for success. A powerful sociological writer who uses extensive research to come up with some challenging theories on human behaviour.,1
165,Three Stars. First half of book much better that the disappointing second half.,0
166,Great book on Success. I always recommend this book to everyone that asks about it! I read it in two days. Interesting and fun read with success stories!,2
167,Absolutely out of this world!. They say traveling broadens the mind. Well boy did this book take me on a journey. I provided me with a context to events that one always thought of as extraordinary and left me thinking about the world like I never could have imagined. As a result of this book I look a world differently; I consider success differently; I truly feel as if I can speak from a more wise point of view about the world and it's events around us.,2
168,"Enjoyable to read, but a stretch to arrive at some conclusions. I've enjoyed a number of Gladwell's books in the past and I find his ability to tell a story while presenting a hypothesis amongst the best in the business. I cannot deny that I did enjoy Gladwell's latest work in Outliers, but it also generated some curiousity on a few of his foundational arguments. While there's no question that timing can sometimes provide amazing opportunities, he fails to look at the exceptions that seem to refute his central thesis.",0
169,EYE OPENER. Malcolm did a terrific job coming up with such a masterpiece that proves that anybody can single themselves out of the arena of obscurity to a platform of greatness with practical steps. Worth reading,2
170,Great!. Great,2
171,Great Read. This was a book club pick and as a whole we enjoyed this read. The information presented is really interesting and encourages you to stop and think about how things fall into place. This read provided a lot of information to discuss during our book club and even prompted some interesting discussions with my hubby.,2
172,"Great for Book Club Discussion. Malcolm Gladwell uses lots of memorable stories in his well-written book debunking what we think about ""success."" Whether you believe he's made his case or not, you can't argue with the facts he presents, only his interpretation of them. It will make for a great book club discussion!",1
173,"Gladwell succeeds as well. Readable, well researched and argued. Even if senior academics challenge his arguments they remain believable and imaginative. A great read - entertaining and fascinating.",2
174,Four Stars. Very nice book! Full of interesting facts - facts curators will love it.,1
175,"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself. In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount. One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself. Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately. I agree with the premise of the book to a point. While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors. By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",2
176,"Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review. The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this. I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage, to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific. Gladwell was intriguing by the way he described his mom and ancestors at the end especially the tenacity of his grandmother gets her daughter (his mom) into school! Five stars!!",2
177,"Long-winded tunnel vision. I thought the chapter (s?) about air travel would never end! Aside from that, I found too many missing variables as to explain success. The author fails to give credit for individual pioneers, yet ironically gives credit to a collective of group thought. Individuals, particularly religious ones, have historically lost EVERYTHING (family, land, wealth, status, etc) in an attempt to raise the standard across cultures. Many of them have been ostracized or stoned to death by the collective because they like their concubines. They like having slaves. And they love their power. The USA was built on a culture of individualism because it CREATES. It was also built upon the fortitude of individuals who have continually shattered the culture of collectivism. Should they succeed, and be rewarded for their success? YES, because they pave the way for others to live their own individual dreams, and keep building layers, as well. Bill Gates' story is an example of a mentor who fought HARD, you can bet, to obtain or create the equipment Bill learned by. As evidenced by the fact that it wasn't available to the collective, because for the whole, their standard is lower. Individuals reject the bucket of lobsters trying to pull them back down and find a way to climb out. Making a lot of money for their effort is an organic side effect. Idividualism is the crust holding in the apple pie. Without it, we just have applesauce.",0

183,Probably what stuck with me the most is that everyone could be an expert at something if they put in the time to get better and. It's the author's perspective that makes you ponder the impact of being considered outside the norm. Probably what stuck with me the most is that everyone could be an expert at something if they put in the time to get better and learn more.,2
184,"Gladwell does it again!. Once again Malcolm Gladwell has broken through popular perceptions with that rarest of analytic tools, common sense. He demonstrates the ability to carry the reader along with him on his journey of discovery. He shows that the 'how' behind our popular ideas of what makes someone successful, while appealing, are mostly erroneous. However, his common sense approach also shows what is possible for almost any of us to achieve.",2
185,"Insightful and interesting. What I enjoyed about this book is it's  straightforward and brings facts to the table, whilst explaining how the stories mentioned contributed to success.",1
186,Best suggestion of the semester. This was a suggested reading by one of my professors. It was a wonderful read. If you are looking for something great to read this is well worth your time. It takes some critical thinking to work beyond the face of the book and dive a little deeper into the process if you want to think.,2
187,"Insightful. Great book, very insightful. Gives you a very honest look into how the greats become ""great"" which is not discussed in many other books.",2
188,"Outliers: The Freakonomics of Psychology. Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an ""outlier."" The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.",1
189,"If You Like Gladwell.... If you like Malcolm Gladwell's previous books, you will like this one. I also find that his narration adds to his books. I enjoyed this one. Much like Tipping Point, it changes the way I see others; especially when observing their success.",1
190,"Eye-opening. I long suspected that success isn't JUST a matter of hard work, but rather a matter of Talent plus Work plus Circumstances. Gladwell proves it, and tells us what the Circumstances are.",1
191,Great book from a different view point.. I really liked this book for the way it reframes the story of success. It makes you think of success and 'experts' in a different light with a different set of circumstances than we are used to thinking of when we think of a successful person. Definitely worth the read as it looks at many different examples.,2
192,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",0
193,"Eye Opening Insights into Factors Guiding Success. This book is a true page-turner. Many of the chapters tell interesting stories that explain why certain people or groups of people are successful at what they do. However, there are some very practical sections too. Scientific evidence showing that success cannot be achieved without extensive practice and that children should be taught to speak intelligently to authority figures are two of the best examples of why this book is a resource for practical applications.",2
194,Excellent book!. It highlights how circumstances can allow for success.,2
195,"Great reading, but not too much new here. I enjoy Gladwell's books - easy to read, entertaining and generally insightful. Outliers fits the bill, although he starts off with a basic assumption - ""We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit."" - that I'm not sure is all that valid. I think most people would agree that circumstance and luck also play a part in creating success, and that's essentially the point he's making in this book. As such, I wasn't blown away by any new insights here - more a validation of what I always believed. Nevertheless, I would still recommend the book.",1
196,"Excelent Writing. A very interesting take on a subject we take very lightly. Surprising facts and insights make this a very entertaining read, and a learning experience",2
197,Fantastic Book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Well written; it is very hard to put down once you start reading!,2
198,"Well worth the reminder. I enjoyed this book and agree with its basic premises. (I do take issue with the broad brush assertion that ""middle class"" parents provide better upbringing for their children than ""poorer class"" parents, with lifelong detrimental consequenses. I've seen examples of unsuccessful parenting from all classes of our society.) But this is a very good book and well narrated. None of us do it alone.",1

Now you get a bare bones cause & effect evidence report with 'Outliers'. You will see the world with a different perspective -- guaranteed!!!",2

I would recommend this to anyone who likes to understand the whys in life.",2
257,Thought-provoking. I am always appreciative of Malcom Gladwell’s ability to make one think deeper into a situation.

However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along",0
273,"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",1

She is a bright girl and could easily get by at age 8 with little effort—but because that will not be true for all her life she needs to learn how to work/study. ""Outliers"" is vignette after vignette telling of ordinary people, who by a twist of fate or other uncontrollable factors, were able to take advantage of a circumstance to/for their own advantage. Literally, a ""prepared mind.""",2
276,Gladwell delivers again. Malcolm Gladwell’s hypotheses are so well supported by his research throughout. The highlight here was the chapter about youth hockey and birthdays.

This is a trippy little book that amused me with its many ""aha"" moments. Many of the detractors have given this book a low rating due to the fact that some of the findings are not new. For the semi-illiterate such as me - that's OK. I haven't read the other books referred to so I found Outliers FASCINATING! I knew that the kids of my Asian friends were better at math than my kids - I just never knew why. I thought Bill Gates was just lucky as well as smart. I didn't know he'd paid his dues, and paid and paid and paid. I'd heard about all the rich old guys of the 1800's but didn't see any commonality until Gladwell pointed out their birth years. Maybe Outliners is not the most innovative, or the first, or the most literary look at the story of success but it's still a darn good read.....bg",1

282,"helpful thoughts for students of education. I am studying to be an teacher, and my educational psychology teacher highly recommended this book. It is key as a teacher to examine how you view the success of your students, and how you encourage them to build successful habits. This book provides insight that counteracts the ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"" myth and helps highlight other factors of success.",1
283,Certainly Attainable!. Success is attainable by all. You just have to get up at dawn for 360 days in a year. Give your kids more exposure to everything they are attracted to,2

Easy to follow, practical applications and it's not all ""hype"" or bs, it's actually great info. You won't regret this buy.",2
290,"Fantastic (but don't read it before a flight). The author has that unique skill of being able to view and interpret the World exactly as it is, not tinted by any preconceptions or expectations. His 10,000 hr rule, from my personal experience, is bang on. I found this book was similar in vein to Freakonomics which I also recommend, and Tipping Point has also been on my list for a while so I will definitely be reading that sometime soon.",2
291,"Four Stars. Good book, only issue is cover was bent upon opening package",1
292,"Depends on your worldview.. Malcolm is very smart and his voice is perfect and clear. I was just hoping to learn about success and learn something that would help me be better. Success is a combination if many things. He puts more emphasis on luck of the cultural draw as a factor in, whereas I put more emphasis on the hard work one does. I was distracted by how much I disagree with him.",0
293,"The Hidden Advantages in Life and Culture. Malcom Gladwell’s Outliers is a fascinating book. It synthesizes the coincidental pathways that lead to greatness rather than common place, and does so on the individual level all the way to the national and cultural levels with resulting ramifications. His thesis is not that everybody is bound for greatness, but more greatness could be achieved if the playing fields of education, sports, and culture could be leveled. This does not mean taking access away from achievers, but developing the means for equal access to pathways of greatness for more children/people.",2
294,"Odd but good. Never had I experienced a book and wonder where the point of the story becomes clear. Yet, I read the entire book and enjoyed the author's view by looking at people and patterns that influence their success/failure. I'm 50, and keep trying to look at the world differently. This helps me keep up with our fast changing world. A nice read for someone that rarely finishes a book. Recommended.",1
295,A lot of data to say nothing new. I did not like this book mainly because it seems the author collected evidence just to articulate his theory.,0
296,"Unique and refreshing.. Malcolm argues that success is not achieved by extraordinary individuals that set out to achieve it out of pure desire. Instead, extremely successful stories are derived from a compound set of events that play out over a long period of time (sometimes it takes generations) and is maximized by the individuals to harvest the potential of what was put in front of them.",1

300,"Excellent material for teachers and prospective parents. Gives a very well thought-out perspective on how a person can become successful (in the common meaning). This could also be called ""The Roots Of Exceptional Success""",2
301,Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,1
302,"A must read particularly for young generations. Very interesting book. I am happy that I came across it. The book had my full attention till it started about the story in Jamaica. I could understand that such story is close to the author. However, I would have preferred more examples that are not directly linked to the author. Nevertheless, I can understand the author being proud of his origins. From my humble point of view, I recommend the book.",1

304,Nice book. Really good reading,2

307,"This book should be called 'selective evidence'. Whilst a lot of the ideas in this book are not Gladwell's alone, he takes responsibility for presenting them as if they were fact. Some parts are fascinating - such as the investigation of pilot errors which lead to crashes - but much of it falls woefully short of sound argument. The main points in the book are either obvious or highly questionable: intelligence alone is no trigger for success; luck is big factor in all great achievements; 10,000 hours of practice is required to achieve excellence at anything.",0
308,"Decent Read. I am generally a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, but this was not one of my favorites. Seemed a bit repetitive. Some good insight, but not so many of the ah-ha moments that I am used to from his books.",0
309,Good buy from AMAZON !. Good buy from AMAZON !,1
310,A different perspective on success stories.. Gladwell tells us that success would depend not only the person himself but also the conditions that surround him and opportunities that would be given to him.

313,Great read. Great quick read that can open some new thought and conversation. I especially enjoyed the chapter on why airplane crashes occur.,2
314,Entertaining parlor game book. Very interesting conclusions. Mind game with statistics. I would take some of the conclusions with a grain of salt as statistics can be manipulated to prove just about anything. Required reading for my college daughters Sociology course. I read it when she was finished and pointed out some of the errors in making conclusions.,1

316,It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) .... Fascinating facts and examples capture the reader's attention but some of the author's opnions are not totally applaudable. It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) and right birthday... all these have to be right in order to be successful.,1
317,.. Nice!,2
318,Cheaper. Bought this book for son. Content are good and cheaper than book stores.,1

322,"Enlightening Insight into how Heritage, Hard Work and Luck Breeds Success. Outliers enlightens. It tells us that success isn't just a gift, but borne out of family history, dating back the ages; it's about luck, timing and old-fashioned hard work. About 10,000 hours honed on one skill will make you an expert.",0
323,Fascinating. I give this book 5 out of 5. It was riveting from start to finish and made me look at this idea of success from a totally different perspective. The stories are emotional and compelling. I want to read it again and again.,2

In fact, this book sparked multiple conversations with friends and relatives. It is definitely intriguing and inspiring.",1
328,"I looked used. I ordered a new copy. When it came in, it looks like it was being read before. I was disappointed because it never happened to me before.",0
329,"Success Unveiled!. The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: ""In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",1

331,Four Stars. Very good book.,1
332,Makes you think!. I'm half way through this book! Well written and easy read! It's really making me think!,2
333,"A Good Reminder to Have Gratitude. This book was an insight reminder to show gratitude to the many people and circumstances that came before, that provide us with the opportunities we have. Though it does not make much mention of the importance of taking advantage of such opportunities, and the imperative strengths of the individuals who did, I felt that no such emphasis was necessary, and enjoyed the perspective that was presented. Knowing the role that circumstances have in success, it gives us the insight to work to create those circumstances for our posterity and those around us who are found without them.",1
334,"Success under the hood. Lots of insights into successful people like Bill Gates, Beatles. Success is the accumulative advantage, so having 10,000 hours' practice early will give you the head start to become outliers. Last but not the least, working really hard, harder than your peers is still the most important factor.",2
335,Just O.K.. It was heavily used. It still had the post it notes in it. It was really quick shipping!,0
336,"You'll never look at pro hockey the same way again.... Great book, very interesting. I only wish he had spent a little more time on the ""What do we make of all this?"" and some analysis/take-away message. Some thought-provoking stuff in here, though.",1
337,"Fascinating. The ideas proposed in this text seem revolutionary to how we generally view success. Though some facets may be a bit trite, like wealth and opportunity, the research and studies done to prove why these things among others are more likely to amount to success is incredibly intriguing. My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research. For an AP Psych summer reading book, I think it is a fantastic choice as it is interesting and thought-provoking as well as an easy and good read.",1
338,CD had issues playing. The book it self was interesting until the second half. It got a bit repetitive and what seemed off topic.,0
339,"Another interesting read. I have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books and am currently reading his David and Goliath offering. I am always led to view things from a different perspective after reading one of the stories in his books. I always learn new things and I don't have to work too hard to do that. I like his writing style, obviously, and his unique way of looking at our world.",2
340,Read This. Absolutely brilliant and informative. No need to say more other than read it for yourself . Very well written and laid out,2
341,Five Stars. great quality,2
342,"Interesting and Inspiring. I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.",2
343,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed. The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair. Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November. It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year. Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children. They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year. However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year. As the school years pass, the gap widens. A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform. Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",1
344,"Outstanding book. But where do I go from here?. This very thought provoking book helps describe how some famous outliers were able to take advantage of the opportunities timing, culture, and hard work gave them. I read this genre of books to help stimulate ideas to help me rise above my own circumstances, or at least be able to help my own children rise above their own. As historic information the hind sight we can gather from this book doesn't help me recognize future opportunities for myself or my progeny. However, the idea of cultural influence having a significant role over these outliers and how that came about was well worth the price of the book.",1
345,"Five Stars. Great book, from a great author.",2
346,New perspective on success. The book was amazing! Very well written and an overall great read. I walked away from this book with a new outlook on success and the good fortune my life has provided me. Can't wait to read a few more of Goldwell's books.,2
347,Great addition to literature on success. This is a well written book that is a great addition to literature on success. It keeps you engaged and summaries it's points well. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic of why some people do poorly and why others have so much success in different areas of life.,2
348,5 star. Read it before. Highly recommend it to anyone. Bought copies for several friends.,2
349,"Interesting. The book provides a very interesting view with many different examples. Outliers doesn't spend too much time talking about one subject, so it keeps you interested and moves around to many different fields (from athletics to air pilots). Offers up interesting evidence to support it's premise. If you're familiar with Malcolm Gladwell's works, this is probably one of his most interesting.",1
350,Fascinating. Outliers was a fantastic book that took me by surprise with each turn of the page. I never knew how many outliers there could be and the subject matter fascinated me with every word. Hard to put down at times and went through the book rather quickly.,1
351,"Good entertaining and illuminating read. It’s a short and sweet explainer for our perception of outliers in terms of people’s success and the reality of their background, circumstances and historical context being supremely pivotal to that success, rather than the traditional “self-made” widely perpetuated story.",2
352,"Transformational. Cutting edge. A must read. That said, this book has been so quoted in the last few years, that it seems positively mainstream. Nevertheless, seminal books have genius in them, and I think that this is one of those.",2
353,Outliers will alert the reader to analyze more carefully his observations for a pattern. Some may be unexpected and yield interesting conclusion. Surprising observations. Unusual conclusions. Made sense.,2
354,"This is not another Blink or Tipping Point. If you've come here thinking that Malcolm Gladwell's latest book could well be a repeat of his previous two instalments, then you are going to go away disappointed. This is definitely not in the same league as the previous two books.",0
355,"This is a great read, a must-read. It automatically became one of my top ten books. Gladwell has a unique way to tell interesting stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to learn more about life and how success is not always what we think it is. Eye opening.",2
356,"Outliers Malcolm Gladwell. Easy to read, logical and clear evidence of aspects that drive success. Whilst a lot of the things are not controllable understanding then is invaluable.",2
357,Five Stars. Fantastic book. Would highly recommend this to anyone.,2
358,"Fact Check?. Initially I enjoyed this book, until I realized that many of the conclusions that Gladwell came to were wrong.",0
359,"Fascinating study of the factors influencing one's success.. Gladwell makes a convincing case that one's date of birth, culture, and sometimes just lucky circumstances influence one's success in life more than intelligence and ambition. His conclusions are interesting and well-documented. The book is well written and is certain fo provoke serious discussion. I do recommend this book.",2
360,Enjoyed the book. This book is a good read and the concept is quite interesting concept. Though it makes you wonder what control you may have over your own success.,1
361,"A different prespective on how success happens. I am impressed by Mr.Gladwell's ability to break down what appears to be a simple concept into different equally important layers that I never would have considered. The research is impeccable, and the conclusions make practical, realistic sense. If you are someone who associates and/or works with people of varied socioeconomic backgrounds, the evidence of Mr.Gladwell's conclusions are obvious.",1
362,"Very Interesting read. I found this book full of useful information. At times, it could be a little dry and redundant, but it is worth the time and energy to read through the whole book. I've listened to the audiobook at times and it helped break things up.",1
363,"Five Stars. Great Read, had to for a class, but honestly it's a good read either way.",2
364,The book came in perfect conditions. It's a great book. The book came in perfect conditions. It's a great book. Malcolm Gladwell was good at story telling and the research behind all those stories was easy to understand. Fascinating!,2
365,"How success comes to many. As a very careful book reader, meaning many books are loaded with wasteful words and ideas. This one clearly is one of value, with research, thought and universal principles for becoming an outlier. I am happy to add this book to my shelf.",2
366,Amazing book. One of the best books I have ever read,2
367,"May the odds be ever in your favor.. An interesting, thought provoking and entertaining read. Timing, preparation, and opportunity. 2/3 of which is out of your control. Good Luck takes on a whole new flavor as Gladwell presents a series of fascinating case studies showing the highs and lows of success and reminding us all how blessed we are.",2
368,"Fun reading, interesting conclusions, but lacking credibility. Coincidentally, I read the chapter about the relative ages of hockey players while I was watching the Chicago Blackhawk beat the Detroit Red Wings in game 7 of the western finals. I thought ""wow this is an amazing insight!"" However, after a quick check of the birth dates for the players I found Malcolm's conclusion to be bunk. Contrary to the book, there is an almost even distribution of birth months for the team members I checked multiple years and countries of origin just to be sure that I hadn't discovered another ""Outlier"". After this discovery,I have to call into question all that I have read from him. Maybe the book should be renamed to ""Outliars!""",0
369,"Read a game changer!. The Outliers is a wonderful demonstration of the complex events that occur for a person to get ahead in this world. Whether it is a birthdate, family legacy, the decade that a person is born in, or the coincidences of war, the unexpected need for 10,000 hours of effort to excel, our lives almost seem to be predetermined to become a star in their field of endeavor. A great read, and I highly recommend everyone select this book to analyze what opportunities lay before them and their children. The discussion on our educational system is a must. Read it!",0
370,"Great Read..... This was my first time reading a Malcolm Gladwell book. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and had planned on reading it on vacation. The only problem was that there was about 6 weeks between when I received the book (ahead of schedule, by the way) and when I planned to leave. I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read. Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of ""pop-science"" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book. I must say that I never found myself wishing for more substance, I thought this was a good book, it brings to light many interesting ideas and thoughts. This book also inspired me to purchase 3 more Gladwell books, and I'm working my way through them now.",2
371,"Statistical Stupidity. In a culture of conformity, it doesn't take a rocket scientist or even a statistician to predict that success is predicated on an individual's environment. This is not a book about outliers. It is a statistical substitution of social determinism for true accomplishment.",0
372,BEST BOOK EVER!. I had to buy this book for a college course and I didn't have any idea what it was about but after just getting through the first 10 pages I was hooked!! I didn't want to finish it because it was that good! It makes you think about how life presents you opportunities and if you are willing to realize that is happening then the truth will not be with held from you.,2
373,awesome. A brilliantly written book that has kept my mind spinning for days. Everyone should read this book and share it with their friends.,2
374,Insightfully refreshing. Absolutely intriguing study into the story of success. A must read for anyone interested in learning more about the ingredients of success.,1
375,"Great insight, fun to read. I like Gladwell’s way of putting data and insights together, but in a fun and easy way. Read Blink and this. Will move to the next.",1
376,Brilliant. Exceptionally well-researched and beautifully written. Gladwell captures the reader from the outset to the very last word. He masters the balance between scientific writing and story- telling with just the right amount of detail. Highly recommended.,2
377,"Gladwell is king. Entertaining and well written, some of the conclusions made in the book are somewhat simplistic, entertaining nonetheless.",1
378,"Nothing that Profound. I read Blink and Tipping Point and Outliers is a lot more watered down. A lot of what Gladwell says is common sense. And yes he does site some interesting studies and makes some interesting points, the book wasn't consistent. Not all the topics really fit the theme of the book so half the time I was wondering why or how the chapter was even relevant.",0
379,"Meh. I've never been so certain that I would never be successful. Apparently most success comes from being one of the lucky few who made the cuts according to age and circumstances or got lucky in every possibly way and stuck with it. That's not me, and it's probably not most peoples. So after reading the book I felt fairly deflated about my future.",0
380,awesome read. This book was great! Extensive research obviously went into this. But the the best thing about is the story. Malcolm Gladwell is an awesome story teller!,2
381,"Not an outlier of a book.. It was ok. Good premise, his attempts at building upon it felt repetitive. I liked it and it's probably the best summary of his 10,000 hours / Outliers theory.",0
382,"Very Good. Very Good, but I think it's a little long for it's simple message. Worth the reading!",1
383,The true story of success. It is a well written book inclusive of proven researched issues. It is also an easy read with glaring examples of points to clarify all issues made.,2
384,"Thought provoking.. I really enjoyed this book however I don't think it goes far enough. Why aren't all the hockey players born in Jan,Feb,March?",2
385,"Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell has a very interesting perspective on why and how people have gained their success. He presented many points I hadn't considered. As an educator, I found the last few chapters very interesting. However, I was wondering where he was going with the rice patties. A bit long winded there. Also, I found the aircraft data beyond the necessary information to round out his point.",1
386,It's okay. It has good moments.,1
387,"Fascinating Quick Read. I'm new to Malcolm Gladwell (hiding in plain sight since my husband gets The New Yorker and I've never read one of Mr. Gladwell's artciles before!), and have to say I love his writing style. I found this book to be thought provoking and enlightening. I was inspired to go read Blink and The Tipping Point as well as some of his articles. e does a great job of taking interesting research and making it a compelling story (Made to Stick).",1
388,Four Stars. Interesting.,1
389,One Star. Still to read but recommended by a reliable frind.,0
390,Paradigm changing. Wonderfull book. Can't stop reading it untill the end. I have now some addtional ideas about education and new ideas about IQ.,1
391,A Must read!!. The author gives us a very insightful perspective on how we look at success in our society. The book gives us a more in depth look at how advantages and opportunities play a major role in success.,2
392,"Great book, terrible condition.. This book is awesome, definitely recommend. I already own a copy but bought this one used. It was advertised as used but in good condition. This book is creased, dirty, and just overall in bad shape. Not as advertised, and quite a disappointment.",0
393,Could not put it down. Interesting look at the intersection of great success and opportunity. Facinating reading!!!!,2
394,What a revelation!. Convincing analysis that seemingly great achievers actually owe much of their success to their parents and ancestors and ... Fate!,1
395,"Eye-opening. Few are better than Malcolm Gladwell at making us re-examine our long-held assumptions about how the world works. Gladwell examines the ""rags to riches"" myth -- among others -- and offers intriguing alternative explanations to the secrets to success. We need more people who question the status quo and look deeper into social phenomena.",1
396,"Great book!. Very enjoyable book. Makes me think of opportunities given to me. As a parent, how I could make such a huge difference in my children's lives.",2
397,Out of the box. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand why success has eluded some people while others have a knack for finding it.,1
398,A great read.. I found the contents of this book fascinating! A great read.,1
399,A great read.. Malcolm Gladwell is a visionary and sees life through a different lens. Very interesting and compelling book. A great read.,2
400,I especially enjoy the way Gladwell will present both the good and .... I can't ever say enough about Malcolm Gladwell. His books are always thoughtful and well laid out.,2
401,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Easy to read book, well researched and a page turner. Uses world class examples that everyone can relate to and people who we all know. Absolutely love it! I particularly liked all the research that went into it without it being too high brow a book. 💯",2
402,"Disappointed. Throughout the book, the author uses narratives of several famous Individuals to generalize to the population. In effect, he attempts to validate his perspective with scattered anecdotal evidence. I found this somewhat misrepresentative during the progression of the book and then it all made sense listening to the interview at the end. The author purposefully planned the book as an ""assault on rugged individualism""--his description. He appears to do this to advance some sociopolitical perspective (again, listen to the interview). Sure, circumstances and opportunity play a role in all our lives, not only the rich or famous. The hockey team story is way overblown. Could 6 more months of physical and emotional maturity make a difference in adolescent athletes? Sure, but are not most sophomore athletes better than their freshman year? Yes, it is simply development, practice, and competitive play. That some are denied opportunity because of these factors and it is unfair is nonsense. The author also seems to discount all the other intra-individual characteristics that could be significant factors in the courses of these lives and the outcomes of the stories. If you have ever made something out of nothing by virtue of your determination, had insights and developed some innovative project, or creatively solved a dilemma, you may not like this book. According to the author's perspective, you just got lucky and then anyone could have done the rest. He magnifies one factor in the equation disproportionally and minimizes the other contributors. I enjoyed Blink, but he's off target here. These are interesting stories, which is why I suspect so many people rate the book so highly. Anecdotes do not equal evidence.",0
403,Didnotnlive to the expectations. If u expect it's going to be as good as the tipping point and daivd and goliath you're going to be disappointed. He has good points an ideas but it doesnt live up to the expectations,0
404,"Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success.... Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success, the value of a commitment to hard work and the edge given to those with a privileged upbringing is worth reading. His ability to interpret statistics within a cultural anthropological framework is a refreshing, agenda free contribution to literature.",1
405,"A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere. It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. ""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.",2
406,Great stories. Author is great story teller,2
407,Great read. Easy read and enjoyed the subject matter,2
408,"We can all be Outliers. From the Beatles to Robert Oppenheimer, and later understanding the cultivation of rice patties, this makes Outliers such an interesting read. The fundamental question in this book is, are geniuses really geniuses? Gladwell argues that it really where you are placed in society and maybe even luck in birth. This book was a fascinating read. Unfortunately sometimes Gladwell does not know how to end a chapter. Once a point is made, it is made. Overall, I did enjoy the book.",1
409,"Great book. Great book, with lots of interesting facts that make you think why people are so good at what they do. I won't give you more details because otherwise I will spoil the fun",2
410,"If you like exploring phenomenon beyond their appearance and if you enjoy story-telling writings about factual subjects, here: success",0
411,"No one succeeds all on their own.. Very good examples and explanation of successful individuals. Birthday, heritage, opportunities and motivation are all parts of the puzzle of success. Makes one appreciate family.",1
412,Five Stars. Such an interesting view on the events described in the book,2
413,Four Stars. Revealing and thought provoking look at yet another set of patterns that Gladwell has uncovered.,1
414,An amazing and enlightening read. One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. It really makes you think about what you are doing in your life that could change.,2
415,A profound paradigm shift.. Gladwell sure knows how to turn beliefs and conventional wisdom on their ears. Deeply thought through and well researched.,2
416,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",0
417,"Success Unveiled!. The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: ""In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",1
418,"Interesting Read. While the book was interesting it could be summed up in two words, God's Providence. While the author sheds needed light on several examples of ""success "", success is not the same thing for everyone. Wealth, property, possessions and power are not equivalent to ""success"". So, while it is interesting to see tje relationship between certain forms of success and the hidden causes it only has limited value.",1
419,Four Stars. Not much of a story but the information was good.,1
420,The book was way more interesting than I originall. I rather enjoyed the book. I found it to be intriguing how the lives of others were changed by circumstances.,1
421,"Thoughts worth considering. I enjoyed reading the book. It made me re-think how I perceive abilities to perform certain types of work. It also brings forth the idea that the most commonly help view of intelligence is was too simplistic and that we must consider emotion, social, and other forms of intelligence beyond logic or pattern recognition. Many times we put our own barriers in front of ourselves and take away opportunities to try new things because we think ""only someone like ___ could do that"".",1
422,"The unfairness of success -- an unexpectedly important book. In Outliers, journalist Malcolm Gladwell examines the accidents of birth date, language, heritage and culture which give particular individuals a head-start in life -- or, equally, result in catastrophic failures. Although journalistic rather than scientific in style, Gladwell makes a wide range of compelling points which become stronger the more you think about them. This is an exceptional book and -- unlike so many of the books of this type -- really does make a significant contribution to how we view our world.",2
423,"Excellent read!. So very interesting and insightful, I’ll be thinking of this book long after it’s read - a truly captivating book!",2
424,"Several hits and a miss. While the book is very detailed and thought provoking all until the last chapter, it falls flat there. While the author makes a good point, the shift from third person/abstract to first person/personal circumstances and history leaves me less interested in the subject of outliers, and almost reluctant to ask why several hundred years of British colonial history should qualify the author for inclusion in this book along with the likes of Bill Gates. I'm chucking it up to authors privilege, but realize that I was fine until that point; the unbiased and non-autobiographical approach to some interesting characters and psychological concepts about outliers were an entertaining way to spend a Sunday.",1
425,What a revelation!. Convincing analysis that seemingly great achievers actually owe much of their success to their parents and ancestors and ... Fate!,1
426,Good Read. The quality was as expected. It suited the purpose for which we bought it. I would happily recommend this product.,1
427,Surprising insights as usual with Malcom Gladwell. Those who know the writing of Malcom Gladwell and have come to expect his high standard and thought-provoking insights will not be disappointed by Outliers. Those who will be reading Gladwell for the first time should get ready for an intelligent read that will stretch steroetypical thinking about how high achievers reach their potential. Highly recommended!,1
428,Great book with great illustrations of their premises. Great book with great illustrations of their premises. Wish it could have had a little more emphasis on qualities of character that allowed people to take advantage of the right timing and social circumstances.,1
429,Great read. Very sound principles.,2
430,Really good. Gladwell is a great author. His style is great and so is his information. Great book.,2
431,Two Stars. useful,0
432,"Author's theory is debatable. I would say that not only the outliers opportunities and chance birthdays play a role, I don’t think the author values an individual's drive ambition near enough in his community theory that outlier success is by luck and privileged opportunity. It is still the individual that has to capitalize on the opportunities that are present.",0
433,Loses direction in later part. The book gets off to a great start with some interesting concepts about potential human development,0
434,"Flawed. In my opinion, Gladwell's concept is interesting , and I enjoyed reading about the hockey players, the Beatles, the technology giants, etc. who fall into the parameters that fit his concept BUT.... there must be TONS of exceptions to his ""rules"" that do NOT fit his parameters and, to me,this is the great unaddressed flaw which makes his book/his theory both weak and questionable.",0
435,Excellent work. An exceptional work on why and how and when an oppportunity to success is born and brought to fruition. An excellent insight shared in an understandable manner.,1
436,interesting book. This is a very interesting book and it will give you acouple of things to think about.,1
437,"Facts, poignant personal history. The book has Gladwell's usual mix of facts and insights, which shed great light even if not always 100% justified by the facts. For example, he points out the impact of general birth period on 19th and 20th-century plutocrats, and on 20th century Jewish lawyers bucking the WASP establishment, and the impact of birth MONTH on Canadian hockey stars. He's strong on showing unexpected correlations, but sometimes gets utopian on ways to fix the resulting inequities. His last chapter is a poignant essay about his Jamaican mother's mixed ethnic background, and all the little coincidences that give us the backgrounds we have.",1
438,I love this book. I purchased this as a gift. I love this book. Full of interesting information and analysys.,2
439,Nice read. Good book for the $,1
440,"Good Read. There are already hundreds of reviews, so I will make this very short.",1
441,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",1
442,"Outliers: The Story of Success. I've read other books by Malcolm Gladwell, and this one is just as fascinating as all the rest! His ability to ask unusual questions ""outside the box"" gives new insight on what makes a person successful. Loved the book, couldn't put it down!",2
443,Gladwell's least impressive work. Tipping point was amazing. Blink was really great. Outliers is... an interesting collection of information without a lot of practical use and application - especially when you justapose this work with his other books.,0
444,Five Stars. Such a great read.,2
445,Five Stars. Great item,2
446,Great book. Half way through and this book rocks! Very interesting and a page turner!!,2
447,Happy reading. A good read.,2
448,"Ignoring the ""outliers"". Malcolm Gladwell calculates and and analyzes statistics that create a norm for the very successful; the outliers in society. The problem is that many parents are so abuzz with these patterns that they are attempting to make successes out of their children. (Darn shame happiness doesn't get factored in) Gladwell does not present statistics or examples of outliers of his formulas, of which I'm certain there are many. So this is an interesting but simplistic presentation. It is enjoyable reading. But as you read, consider the outliers of his formulas!",0
449,"Fantastic. This has to be one of the best books I have read. The author made me look at my life and that of others with a different viewpoint. I no longer beat myself about things I haven't achieved in life, I now recognise that the timing was wrong and that when it is right I must be ready and have the desire to achieve whatever it is.",2
450,"Practice makes perfect!. I always thought that certain people posses traits which make them better at somethings than most. But this book does a great job dispelling this type of thinking. The stats are striking and make sense. A good read in my opinion for all readers. I still think that some people are just naturally better at things, especially sight or peripheral vision which make them better at sports than most, but practice could account for that as well. This books goes into the background of why people are better at things. It makes sense.",0
451,Three Stars. Sets out well but gets stale about 70% in,0
452,"3.5 Stars: Depends on Your Perspective.... As someone whose work is in the field of academic psychology, Gladwell's heavy reliance on anecdotes to support his theories was frustrating. However, I can certainly respect his ability to find connections where others have not and to follow through with writing up his findings in a compelling way. Taken as interesting stories about successful people, I can appreciate this book. However, from the perspective of a researcher in psychology who prefers to rely on appropriately powered studies and solid statistical analyses to learn about the conditions under which people excel, I'm not crazy about it.",0
453,"Believe the hype. Online reviews can only do so much to enhance the reputation of a literary and intellectual work on the scale of Outliers and, needless to say, the book deserves it's stellar reputation.",2
454,"Please, please learn something amazing.. None of us made it without the assistance of others, of a culture, of a time, a place, a weird opportunity. This book makes us look at success from a different perspective. No denying person initiative, but factors can change everything. I will read it again...and again.",2
455,A Model for Communicating Complex Ideas in an Interesting Way. Malcolm Gladwell's genius is to write interestingly about complex ideas and show their relevance to us.,2
456,"Fascinating and Insightful. Outliers--like The Tipping Point and Blink before it--is a fascinating study of phenomena that we all observe but often fail to question and, therefore, do not completely understand. Many authors provide the slew of data that he does, but without adequate illustration it is difficult to connect to their material. Still others are great at incorporating anecdotes but do not provide adequate foundation for their conclusions. Gladwell, however, masterfully combines research and anecdote in this examination of the factors that have shaped the success of everyone from star hockey players to industrial magnates to nuclear physicists to superstar lawyers.",1
457,"Love anything written by Malcolm Gladwell. So interesting, wish the book was longer! I had borrowed this book from the library. Liked it so much, I ordered a copy for a friend.",2
458,"Great book. I enjoy how Gladwell helped me see so many factors to the success people have. It would seem that nearly everything can help propel a person forward or just the wrong combination could hold them back, but hard work makes a huge difference!",2
459,"Best spur buy I've done. I was bored in a 4 hour Saturday morning class about technology management. I've heard about this book and was curious about it on why I was so popular. I found out after a few pages in. Mr. Gladwell grabs you instantly and never lets go until the last page. There's so much knowledge, one you've finished, it changes perspectives and opinions. It was a great ride and I'm looking forward to many more from Mr. Gladwell.",1
460,"Nice overview. While you might not agree a 100% with all the success statements that Gladwell makes, his stories are fast to read and are overall enjoyable.",0
461,"interesting. I enjoyed reading this book but I guess I didn't read the review or summary of the book very well. It really wan't what I expected. It was a good read, but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case. I didn't find the book inspirational, but at the same time, it kept my attention to the very end.",1
462,"The Avant-Garde View of Success. ""No one-not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses-ever makes it alone."" That, at least, is the view of renowned sociologist and writer Malcolm Gladwell. In his latest book, ""Outliers: The Story of Success,"" he questions common assumptions about achievement. For example, he argues that there is no such thing as the ""self-made"" man. His conclusions, though rooted in common sense and sociological studies, are often unconventional. You may be surprised to discover that your upbringing and even your birthday have just as much of an influence on success as your IQ or work ethic. utliers is not a self-help book. It offers very little practical advice on ""how to succeed."" Rather, it takes an impersonal and sociological (though no less entertaining) approach to success. You will, however, be surprised at how much you can get out of Gladwell's writings. Although it does not give the reader a significantly greater knowledge about how to succeed, Outliers will definitely put into perspective the excessive emphasis that our society places on ""success.""",1
463,"convincing story of success. The author definitely has gotten his ten thousand hours of practice in the nurturing environment. The book is written clearly and convincingly. If this is not enough, there are many good videos on youtube, where he further elaborates his point. Do possess necessary prerequisites (iq sufficient for university or height for basketball), work hard in supportive environment, have your feet firmly on the ground, and the success is likely to come. Of course, there may be systemic (chronological, cultural, etc.) obstacles. Blame these if success didn't happen or be grateful if you were lucky",1
464,"The Chicken or the Egg. Life is unfair. Yes, different opportunities face all of us. However, and this is what the book seems to ignore, it is up to the individual to recognize and act. So, I don't believe it is the opportunity that make an outlier, it is the recognition of the opportunities, vision, desire, determination and action that produced the likes of Bill Gates. Keep in mind Bill Gates went to middle school with 300 other kids who all had the same access to the computer. So didn't all 300 have the same opportunity?",0

467,"A quick read. I found this to be a very interesting view on success and successful people. The author has a very unique way of bringing forth the 'right time-right place' expression. He also provided amazing visuals within his stories, and the differences between how we are raised and where we come from. Please do remember, that having old, family money or looking good still has its advantages.",1

He even presents at psychology conferences because he is better at teaching psychology than most psychologists. This is his third book and may be the best.",2

476,Useful. I liked the format used in approaching the reason for writing the book.,2
477,"A Good ""Eye Opener"" but Gladwell Goes to Far. Outliers, like many of Gladwells other books, starts with a rather simply idea and supports it through various stories. In this case the idea that Gladwell promotes is that massive success, such as that achieved by Bill Gates or The Beatles, occurs not primarily from hard work or raw talent but rather from a ""patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” Gladwell weighs luck above all other criteria in any success story.",0
478,One of the most fascinating books I have ever read!. This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It essentially disproves the romantic notion that a person's hard work and perseverance overcame any and all obstacles and their achievements are entirely of their own accord with no luck and no help from anyone else. Malcolm Gladwell gracefully weaves through a wide variety of topics ranging from Canadian Junior Hockey to Bill Gates to New York City's late 19th century garment industry to show how outliers thrived in their time and place.,2
479,Five Stars. I found this a very interesting book.,2
480,"Outstanding!. A division 1 baseball coach actually recommended this book at a showcase camp! It covers a wide range of interesting topics and many of the thought provoking concepts have spurred excellent conversations with my kids as well my peers at work.

487,"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",0
488,Greatness: nature or nurture? :-). Very interesting take on where success is born. I certainly think this is true. And represents an oft-forgotten part of the picture. Love the the undertone that says that we are all capable of greatness; that circumstance plays a bigger role than you'd think.,2
489,"Great read. As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, I wasn't surprised that I loved this book. I would recommend this as it is a great read.",2
490,"Thought provoking. While the concepts are clearly obvious, in combination they are powerful. A good quick read. A lot to contemplate. Simone",1
491,Interesting. Some very interesting concepts here that will ring true for every parent who's had kids in organized sports. A lot of practical application to work life as well.,1
492,"Not my taste. Such a drag, some parts picked up, others just boring.",0
493,"Thought-provoking and entertaining. Gladwell does it again, only this time he lays the foundation for understanding why certain people achieve more in life than others that may have had similar circumstances. His stories and data energize thoughts that make you wonder about your own upbringing and that of your children. He offers suggestions on how we can improve our progeny and grant them the opportunities needed to become the stuff of this book -- an outlier. Highly recommend this fun and thought-provoking book!",2
494,Good quality book. Good quality!,2
495,"a totally fascinating book. A fascinating book, filled with interesting stories and enlightening facts, all told in a very entertaining style. Cannot wait to read Maxwell's next book.

I was recommended this author, and I wanted to know more about how and why some people, over others, are successful and what deems 'success in life', so the combination of author and subject resulted in me not being able to book the book down. This well known author lives up to his worthy reputation with skilful writing backed up with exhaustive research and explanations.",2
498,"Unimpressive. Unimpressive. Lots of flimsy data, incorrect assumptions and circular reasoning peddled as fact. Moreover, I don't think Gladwell actually says anything new in this undercooked rehashing of the nature versus nurture debate.",0
499,"Intersting, interesting, interesting. Gladwell alwasy provides food for thought. This book is very entertaining and iteresting. I love all the anecdotal evidence althogh he has statistics too. It definately makes you think differently about success. As usual, I'm not sure he got the title right. He seems to not come back around to the idea of outliers very well. I'd title it Hard-earned Success or Lucky Duck.",1
500,"A solid book, great stories and was enjoyable to read the whole time.. I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.",1

505,Interesting book. Read this book and while it can be dry at times with facts and figures the premise is at least interesting. I do not agree that all success is a result of environment but it would be foolish to ignore that there is impact.,1
506,"Good. Good , but shipment time is too long, I was waiting long time, so I hope nest time can be quickly, the book looks like new one",1
507,"An easy and good book to read. Short review but a lot of what is discussed is common sense and general knowledge but the author takes a interesting twist it on things by using real life examples and scenarios, that elevate your knowledge base of what makes some people successful and others not. More over, it is a very easy fluent book to read which also made it interesting.",1
508,"very insightful and provocative. The invocation of Hofstede's theory of social power distribution (PDI) was quite refreshing, and how one's socio-cultural background has so much influence on his/her success on the world stage.

527,"What It Takes To Make It. Outliers is a sociological study which brings sense to a confusing world. We've always been told, often with ""up from the bootstraps"" Alger allegories, that it takes hard work, smarts, and determination to be a success. However, things like family background and socio-economic status really do matter. Even plain old luck, such as where and when you were born, can make a huge difference. Measured IQ may afford an advantage, but only to a point. Those intent on the big prize must perfect their craft over the course of 10,000 hours, just as Bill Gates, the Beatles, and Michael Jordan did.",1
528,"decent book. To sum it up: exceptional people are largely a result from environmental factors. If you find this intriguing, read the book. Otherwise, it may not be groundbreaking to you. He does address several pretty interesting specific examples though, like the heritage of Bill Gates.",1

That the greatest things I can give them are opportunities & support- the kind of support that those from a cultural legacy different from mine would consider to be pushy! Frankly, I don't care. They will be outliers.",2
535,"Fascinating. Gladwell argues that the American ideal of independent success against all odds is a myth. Success is the result of a perfect combination of time, place, and culture. People who succeed despite great adversity often have hidden advantages. Some negative societal forces can actually serve as advantages in the right place and time.",2

This is the first book in a long time that has altered my compass bearings. I will never see successful people in the same light. It doesn't make you doubt their accomplishments. You do walk away with a better understanding of what is an isn't the cause of them. He ought to do a study on negative outliers too.

548,"It was a pretty good book. I just wish that the author should ha. It was a pretty good book. I just wish that the author should have discussed members of our society that have achieved success that are not famous like people he discussed. For example, Sam Walton, the creator of Wal-Mart, was a very successful man.Wal-Mart has affected the lives of many people. Has Wayne Gretzyk affected the lives of millions? Maybe...but not at the extent of Walton. In addition, Gretzyk wished he had the financial fortune of Walton. As a result, I believe this would have a very good book if the author did not just discuss many stream people.",0
549,"Food for thought. There were many examples that were good but not enough emphasis on the whole point. I was kind of left thinking, ok, did I miss something? What was the conclusion? Some of the examples seemed far fetched and I wanted to glean from the writers knowledge something useful for me and mine. Not so sure that happened!",0

551,"Okay. I honestly have not finished this book. I just could not get into it. The concepts are interesting enough but if you are looking for a read with some sort of story line this definitely is not the book. When I have more time on my hands i will give it another go. however, there is no rush to do so.",0
552,"Entertaining and thought-provoking. Gladwell does it again in his pithy tradition. He takes a topical subject and fleshes it out in new ways. I never lost interest and was fascinated with his approach to dissecting those whose gifts (intelligence and success mainly) are outside the norm. I enjoyed his premises, though I do not necessarily agree with all of them. I had a difficult time for example, linking the rice paddy work ethic to the success of Asians in math. But I enjoy reading opinions and research and that is exactly what Gladwell combined here. I was also hoping for a summary that included what we average people can do for ourselves that might place us closer to the kind of outliers he selected for this study. Alas, it appears to be accidents of birth, ancestry and practice. Oh well, I can continue to enjoy life as an average person!",1

554,"his best book yet.... I have to say that I really loved this book, and was sorry to reach the last page. I liked Blink and Tipping Point, but I thought this one made a bigger impact on my thinking about several important subjects. Great observations and insights from a gifted writer make for a great read.",2
555,"Good book that makes you think different. I really enjoyed this book by Gladwell. Within it, there are a lot of different ways in which he challenges us to think differently about success and understand why some people end up in better positions than others. Worth a read for a curious mind!",1
556,Four Stars. Really good condition,1

It is full of 'A ha"" moments When I first started reading it I wasn't enthralled but as the author started to show connections and underlying situations that build up to success, I was really impressed.",2
569,"Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.. I also found the data employed in this chapter to be misleading. Considering how few people have the IQs you reference, it is essentially impossible to get enough data to make reliable conclusions. Just because factors like emotional intelligence matter should not discount the value of actual or intellectual intelligence. In fact, if IQ is such a crude measurement system (which most people realize), then why use it at all to ""prove"" your theory? The idea that Einstein's level of intelligence was not that important to his success simply disregards reality. Unfortunately, this chapter, with its labored attempts to prove that we all have what it takes - that the smart kids are no better - seems to me like a bit of sophistry that once again makes people feel better about themselves and has undoubtedly resulted in the widespread embrace of this book in our school system that is soft and overly-sensitive when it comes to success and failure. he ideas explained in ""The Matthew Effect"" did seem to hold some water, however, and I could relate. My school district has an enrichment program that tests students to see if they are eligible in the early years of elementary school. Once in the program, you basically do not leave. Not that we are in high school, it is very clear that many of the students in the program do not belong there. At the time we were tested, age certainly made a difference. In fact, for the first several years of the program, I remember that all of the students in it (myself included) were among the oldest in their respective grades. This was probably the best chapter in the book, as you backed up your claims very well. While reading it, I questioned whether I still belong in the enrichment program many times. It was an interesting point to make, and it did give me a bit of a new perspective. espite the aspects of the book I did not like, I do appreciate that you attempt to answer the question of success. Frankly, I feel that it is unanswerable. It certainly is a fascinating topic. incerely, ichael Gildin",0

Hard work, preserverence, determination, commitment and resilience are qualities that this book does not celebrate. Instead, it focuses on culture, upbringing, date of birth and chance. If you are looking for self improvement, I would highly recommend skipping this title and reading books like “The secret of the ages” by Robert Collier, “The power of your subconscious mind” by dr Joseph Murphy, “The richest man in Babylon” by George S.

He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line. Maybe I had completely missed the point. Maybe it is me and I simply ""didn't get it""...",0
588,Brilliant. Exceptionally well-researched and beautifully written. Gladwell captures the reader from the outset to the very last word. He masters the balance between scientific writing and story- telling with just the right amount of detail. Highly recommended.,2
589,"Great lessons.. If you read a lot of self-help books, Outliers puts the icing on the cake. It reinforces the fact that the most gifted people literally had time, sources of opportunity, used their abilities to negotiate for what they need, and literally took advantage of the number of hours in a day to get ahead. Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting). Great book imo.",2
590,"Encouraging but not useful... Avoid if you are looking for suggestions from the book. The first chapter is good, but the latter chapters are becoming worse. I gave up on the fourth chapter, so cannot say much about the things after that. But for the first several chapters, not many practical suggestions are given other than working hard. The main theme is genius is not born genius, they are ordinary people. But how can you replicate their success? Woops, the book just doesn’t care. Pretty disappointed... Might be an encouraging book, but far from being useful.",0
591,Five Stars. Awesome book. Opens your mind to see the world as opportunity.,2
592,"Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatl. If you've ever heard people say, ""You gotta put in 10,000 hours into something before you're an expert."" Chances are they read Outliers. Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatles. The stories and the social science behind them is fascinating and Gladwell's prose makes it an easy, liquid-like read. For people who like to think and want to know how things work, this book is for you.",2
593,"Buy it now, you won't regret it.. One of my favourite ever books. Gladwell is an awesome writer who provides such an educated, interesting insight on things that you just hadn't considered. This book has honestly changed the way i now think about things. Everyone should read this book.",2
594,"Enlightening Insight into how Heritage, Hard Work and Luck Breeds Success. Outliers enlightens. It tells us that success isn't just a gift, but borne out of family history, dating back the ages; it's about luck, timing and old-fashioned hard work. About 10,000 hours honed on one skill will make you an expert.",0
595,"Malcolm Gladwell interpreted data correlated with ""Time"" to show us ....

596,A surprisingly insightful foray into the real ingredients for success .... A surprisingly insightful foray into the real ingredients for success in the critical early gestation phases of successful people's lives.,1
597,Read this for humbling insights about success.. Everyone should read this book for an insight into what creates success. Reading this will be a humbling experience for some.,2
598,"Not what you expect. This book has opened my eyes to look for opportunities that may have otherwise been missed. The possibility to work hard shouldn't be considered a daunting task,rather an opportunity for development. Great read.",2
599,"Great read.. Wonderful. However, I believe there is more to success than being the right person in the right place and the right time.",1
600,This book will completely change the way comprehend success. I can’t take off my outliers goggles of scrutiny,2
601,"More people need to read this. This book clarified and substantiated many of the thoughts I was having. I was wondering why I didn't fall into a ""good"" job when I graduated from college in 2009. Now it all makes sense.",2
602,"Good read. Easy to flip through as a collection of interesting histories but, a lot of psychological and sociological insight tucked into relatively few chapters.",2
603,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",1
604,Five Stars. good,2
605,It's okay. I'm a fan of Malcom Gladwell and read Tipping Point and Blink. Blink was definitely my favorite. I h ad some difficulty remaining involved with Outliers. Sometimes it's just where you are when you're reading a book. Judge for yourself.,0
606,Great read. This book is a must for any young adult. The way everything is broken down and simplified is just incredible. I read this book in college and still continue to read it and give it as a gift to people.,2
607,"Cover book very disappointing. The cover book is very bad, it looks as if it was used before, some pages are badly cutted, returning this product for sure.",0
608,Very interesting and essential book. I was really lucky to hear about this book and I felt more lucky when I finished it 2 minutes ago.,2
609,"Great book. Kept my attention throughout and goes into great detail, providing socio-cultural-historical context for each chapter. Would definitely recommend to others.",2
610,"good book. very interesting read/listen. the author delivers their point across clearly, would recommend it to anyone wanting some insights in what makes great people great...",1
611,Always worth a read.... I always enjoy Gladwell's writing and books. I was learn something new and am exposed to new concepts & ideas!,1
612,"... conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work .... A very interesting read at the start but the conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work ethic, be born at the right time, get the lucky breaks, and be from a middle class to reach the very top in the sport, business or music industries. Well what a surprise!",1
613,A great book by Gladwell... Worth buying!!. It's a book which gripped my attention...,1
614,"Gladwell always delivers!. Another well crafted series of stories that beautifully illustrate his thesis. This time, it's about luck and hard work, historical timing, cultural norms and the intricate web that makes us who we are.",2
615,"His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative. Gladwell's writing is capable both of being utterly convincing (the phrase ""selling ice to an Eskimo"" comes to mind) and of taking a simple truth readers already know (that success comes from our own very specific, cultural circumstances - in addition to hard work) and making it seem as though it is shockingly novel and groundbreaking (his thesis focuses on trends of success that are counter to, or sometimes not even considered in, our expectations).",1
616,"Thought provoking read with interesting case studies. My favorite quote: ""Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky -- but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.""",1
617,"Stating the Obvious. Had high expectations about this book given its reviews and mention of how it would change one's life and make you feel clever. Unfortunately, none of that happened. ""Outliers"" should probable be best seen as a collection of anecdotes and observations...some interesting, some bland, many unrelated.",0
618,Three Stars. An interesting subject and thesis that could be explored further and more case studies should have been included.,0
619,"Fascinating. This is such an interesting view on success, failure, circumstance and opportunity. It gives credence to the idea that there are always larger forces at work when it comes to making a name for oneself in his or her chosen field. My only real complaint is I would like to have seen more subject examples - particularly in the fine arts - with fewer pages spent on each one (Once the points are made, things get a bit repetitive). Other than that, it was really an enjoyable read, the stats alone being worth a look. It definitely tilts my world view a bit!",1
620,Good!. Very interesting!,1
621,The cover of the book was torn. The cover was badly damaged. Sorry to get that from Amazon....,0
622,"Very interesting, good storytelling. I thought Gladwell does a great job telling stories and a relatively good job at keeping them interesting. I feel like this type of books always struggles to keep your attention throughout because you almost have to make some significant conclusions early to entice readers to continue. The rest of the book comes off anticlimactic. Outliers does a good job but I still felt like 80% of the closure was found in the first 20% of the book, or something along those lines. I enjoyed that he didn't shy away from conclusions that might be viewed as politically incorrect.",1
623,She didn't like it.. this book was for my 15 yr old daughter...she's mature for her age. She didn't like it.,0
624,"Redundant. Most of it is common sense. Makes a lot of analogies to back up a point that no one really argued with. He has good points, but 99% of the book is telling stories of people that fit his point, instead of actually talking about the point. This book could have had a lot more content than it did.",0
625,great book. definitely recommend this read. success is the accumulation of advantages accompanied by hard work. keyword: advantage.,1
626,Good. Good book,2
627,Five Stars. Brilliant book,2
628,"surprising clues about success. By looking at groups of successful people in various fields such as sports, business, legal profession, the author comes up with startling conclusions. His research can be useful for parents and young people in choosing where to focus their attention. As an older person, I can recommend it as a good read and passing it on to the younger generations.",1
629,One of my favorites. One of my go to book gifts. Classic Gladwell.,2
630,"Interesting, but Selective Evidence. This is a book with lots of interesting and entertaining stories which shed some light on how culture affects and propels geniuses to greatness.

635,Very good book. Good book,2
636,"very interesting and engaging book. Very, very interesting, definately a good read for two reasons: it is thought-provoking when it comes to our idea of how success is achieved and it is very well written! In the ending, when the author chooses to use his own family history to illustrate the point he makes throughout the book, there are some shocking passages on racism, it really makes us realize how far we've come and how much is still to be accomplished. The chapter on aviation and the way culture influences how we act is pretty engaging. I had a really good time reading the book!",1
637,"Practical and always good for a second read!. Malcom Gladwell’s style of writing and practical creative example is what made me read this book again. Its just tickle some thoughts, memories or failure where it boost you for a forward and positive thinking. Love it! All the respect . Namaste",2
638,Outliers. Brilliant explanation of how luck and hard work are intertwined in how a person or people become successful and also how some smart people don't!,2
639,great read. this book puts a lot of things into perspective. It's a must read before having kids if you want to give them a good head start.,2
640,Nothing. My daughter loved this book,2
641,Fascinating.. His explanation of what makes individuals unique and successful is really fascinating. Made me take a second look at my own talents and those of my family.,2
642,Outliners?. Don't remember buying this,0
643,"Analysis of the obvious?. At the risk of tempering all these glowing reviews, while interesting for a time, Outliers dragged into the quagmire of coincidence by the middle of the listen. Many of Gladwell's claims of the cause for Outliers can be easily dismissed by time/place/circumstances increasing the chances of the analyzed event occurring. When the book headed off into the weed of behavior analysis, I became completely detached and tuned out. I guess my tepid review is the outlier, but be careful with you expectations of a great listen...it was not.",0
644,"decent read. Glad well writes well, he doesn't do the best job tying this one together, but he entertains.. He always entertains.",1
645,Five Stars. Brilliant book,2
646,"Not bad, but not as engaging as Blink or Tipping Point. I'm a fan of Gladwell's work, but this book did not grab me with the same intellectual hook as his prior two efforts. The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me. The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",0
647,"Impossible to put down. I highly recommend this book its such an eye opener, its hard to pin point which part is the best. You will enjoy every page.",2
648,Really interesting reading. It explains a lot of different thing about differences.,2
649,"Really nice book!. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in understanding society, the goods and the bads. It gives a different perspective of ideas you already have.",1
650,"This book changed the way I view success.. I grew up in asian community where working hard is the norm. I though I became who I am today because of my own effort without realizing the opportunities I was given. This book made me look back into my past and appreciate how lucky I am to have a good family, to meet inspiring people, and to have a chance to work hard and succeed.",1
651,"learned a couple good things to know. Was a good read. author makes / popularizes some unexpected connections about life and work. he rambles & repeats himself at the end of some of the chapters, just skim these parts and jump to the next chapter.",1
652,Four Stars. ok,1
653,Five Stars. Compulsory reading I think!,2
654,"Read This Carefully For Your Own Good!. So just when I was sure Blink was the most thought provoking book I'd read since Walker Percy's Lost In The Cosmos, along comes Malcolm Gladwell with Outliers. The subtitle, ""The Story of Success"" is a little off-putting because this book is actually MORE than it promises. These aren't just stories of success: the careful reader will find his own pathway to success. Gladwell doesn't promise as much. His publisher probably won't let him. But in my opinion this book is that important. So buy it, and then read it. Carefully.",2
655,"A reveal of what the ""Golden Boy"" is now named. A modern review of the opportunities that make successes. Some, the common person can use influence to improve life, some will just be nice to observe in others.",1
656,Read it. Good read,1
657,"Necessary Read!. Malcolm Gladwell gives perfect insight into how talent, access to opportunity, and attitude, may come together to define success. Drilling down to how birth month can impact success was a great epiphany for me.",2
658,"Good book. Very interesting book based on facts, well writing, makes me want to read more from him (gladwell). Fully recommend book",1
659,Superb book on understand the drivers of social mobility. I read it in 2 days. Truly inspiring and though-provoking. I cried on the chapter about the Christopher Langhans of the world and learned a great deal about parenting ( for future reference). I was challenged as an educator. I wish information like this was available when I was a teen and my parents would've been in their early 30s. I will use this as a tool in adjusting my social mobility.,2
660,more anecdotal than empirical. The content is more anecdotal than empirical. Expect a breezy read which will change your perspective on the ingredients for success.,1
661,"My dad recommended this guy. Almost sad at times, it completely dismantles the sentiment that success happens in a vacuum. Speaks at depth, without ever being boring or overly complex. Great read",2
662,cool and the gang. I liked it. I think it's the perfect book for people who want to make sure their kids be overachievers. haha.Really it's a interesting book an hope you get it and enjoy listening to it. It definitely gets you thinking.,1
663,"Couldn't put it down. As with his other two books, The Tipping Point and Blink, I couldn't put this book down. Malcom Gladwell's writing is captivating. His ability to share information through relevant story telling is unparalleled.",2
664,"Good point. The book makes a great point and if you can internalize the point of feeling comfortable being different only to find success because of it later, it's great. Unfortunately the book moves extremely slow and it was difficult for me to remain interested in the numerous statistical examples that make the point. Good point nonetheless.",0
665,"Importance of Outliers!. Fantastic read, insightful, informative and made me want to read more from Gladwell! Highly recommended",2
666,Gladwell's finest work so far.. This is probably one of Gladwell's defining works. He digs into why the kind of success that creates what we perceive to be those outliers like Bill Gates is usually a whole lot more than just serendipity. Highly recommended. I'd argue that this work is as much a philosophical piece as it is scientific or business.,2
667,"Arrived fast, amazing book. Very good book have bought it multiple times and recommended to multiple friends",2
668,Great service from the seller. Fantastic customer service and a great product,2
669,"Five Stars. An excellent read. Hugely varied examples throughout. ""View the world through a true academics eyes"".",2
670,"Interesting...very interesting!. I read this because it was the summer reading assignment for my seniors this year. It started off really strong with some amazing information, but somewhere toward the middle it started getting a little dull. Upon our classroom discussion, most of the kids agreed with me on this point. However, I still would say it is worth reading because it raises some curious issues.",1
671,"Ignores some things. When pointing out the luck of being born at certain times, it isn’t mentioned how many others who did not become outliers were also born in that period. So even if the periods were vital, there was still separation from the masses. It also doesn’t take into account that people other than outliers were provided with similar or better opportunities yet still didn’t become outliers.",1
672,"Fantastic book. Lots of real-life examples, evidence-based approach, entertaining to read - what else can you ask for? I wish most of the books were written in the way this author writes.",2
673,"You'll never look at pro hockey the same way again.... Great book, very interesting. I only wish he had spent a little more time on the ""What do we make of all this?"" and some analysis/take-away message. Some thought-provoking stuff in here, though.",1
674,"Four Stars. Great book, makes clear and concise connections between demographics, history, culture and intellect.",1
675,Great for first time parents.. I'm about to have a baby and this is a great read for expectant parents. I loved this book. Definitely would recommend it.,2
676,"Good Stuff. It's no secret that Gladwell's books are fascinating and full of great insight. I really wanted to get it but at an affordable price. Thanks to Amazon, I got my wish. This is a great read and I received it in great condition. I definitely recommend reading ""Outliers"" and ordering it on Amazon.",1
677,"Unscientific. I had great hopes of this book, but was very disappointed. The experiments and tests were so open to bias and the conclusions sweeping or not grounded in what had been established by the ""tests"" that the book lost all credibility for me. I give as an example - the experiment involving students' responses at being inconvenienced in their passage along a hallway. The sample is too small in number, too narrow in population selection etc...also the interpretation of responses was entirely subjective and we aren't given the methods & benchmarks for measuring responses etc. I don't remember anything else about the book except feeling irritated by the testing and conclusions. (If something doesn't interest you - you won't remember it!) Maybe I'm hypercritical because I've supervised a number of PhD students etc, but I can think of so many wonderful authors (often unsung) from whom I continue to learn.",0
678,Very Good. This is a very good book and an eye opener. I wonder how some of the concepts apply to what is going on today and what kind of successful people we will see in the future.,1
679,Good book. Good book. Very happy with this.,2
680,Love it. Love it,2
681,Interesting read. Food for thought on what makes some people more successful than other.,1

683,Another point of view. A great book that opens your mind up to a different way of thinking.,2
684,Lots of boring stats. Not the best book I have read. Lots of boring stats and never really felt like the book was getting anywhere. Was hoping for a twist or punch at the end but unfortunately just more stats.,0
685,"Fun read. I enjoyed this read. It's reasonably light, not packed with important academic studies or applications. But the stories are fun and point toward valuable insights that you will find applicable to everyday life.",2

687,Why are great people great? They take the opportunities given. Great book. Easy read. Hits home his point again and again and gives many case studies of “success”.,2
688,"Amazing. Upon nearly every page turn, I found myself thinking or even saying aloud, “this is amazing.” I haven’t been this enthusiastic about awarding a 5-star review in a long time. When I have more time, I hope to revise and make this a more substantive review. I wish I’d read this 10 years ago.",2
689,Interesting. A really interesting invite into the way the world works and what puts one ahead of the pack. Recommended reading.,1
690,"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening. I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging. He was right. Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance. In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary. Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts. Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control. These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",2
691,"Three Stars. The more I learn about Gladwell, the less I appreciate and respect his work.",0
692,Excellent read. Great book!,2
693,Great book. This is a very interesting book who make you realise a lot of think about the way we are raising our kids.,2
694,Coming back to point after dissapoinment by Blink. I have been reading Gladwell systematically in past. He is certainly author of great talent to tell interesting stories with serious message attached to it.,1
695,Must Read. By far the best book from Gladwell. Everything from here has been down hill. This is the only book of his I am glad I bought.,2
696,"A great story of how certain people succeed.. I loved how this book started out and identified what ""Outliers"" are and what made them that way, for instance, Bill Gates is an outlier because of the circumstances that existed that made it possible for him to succeed.",1
697,Good sized book to fit in your luggage or handbag. Not finished this yet (40 per cent through ) but book arrived in gold quality as per Amazon standard. Interesting book about the impact of socio economic factors and luck paved the way for some of the world's most recognisably successful entrepreneurs/athletes.,2
698,"I'm sure as hell damn good at what I do right now. I bought this book sometime in 2014 and since I just had to post a review for another book I just read, I've decided to share my thoughts on this book as well.",2
699,"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",1
700,"Good book that makes you think different. I really enjoyed this book by Gladwell. Within it, there are a lot of different ways in which he challenges us to think differently about success and understand why some people end up in better positions than others. Worth a read for a curious mind!",1
701,"thought provoking. I really enjoyed this book. I definitely think differently about people with great success. Gladwell... If the opportunity presented itself, how many of us would be in a position to use out talents to rise to the top?",2
702,"Interesting.... A lot to think about, though I might need to buy a paper copy to check out some of the references. Although admittedly, listening to these ideas made me a little depressed...",1
703,"Finally - A GREAT BOOK!. For the most part, after reading a book I simply can't stand it...most books could realistically be a 2 page magazine article, but this book was packed with info, examples, and research.",2

710,It is a book!. A very good and interesting read.,1

713,Eye opener. Love this book was recommended by a friend and it really changes your perspective on success and can motivate you also,2
714,"excellent book about success. The book Outliers describes how success is made through hard work, having the right family ethic, and total luck. This book somewhat dispels the idea that success can only be attained by those who are innately gifted. This book definitely contrasts itself from the popular belief of what success is.",2

716,One Star. not bad,0
717,Received. Interesting read,1
718,Four Stars. This book has been completed and shared with others in my circle.,1
719,"Wow, interesting.. Malcolm Gladwell 's book is a fascinating collection of root causes. There are a multitude of answers to questions that I had never thought to ask. Malcolm Gladwell explores the roots of success to a depth that I never would have considered without provocation. I really enjoyed this book. I look forward to enjoying many new aha moments as I read the other books written by Mr. Gladwell. I had selected this book in hopes of discovering some recipe that I might employ to foster the interests of my children. I had hoped to discover the formula for helping to cultivate/ foster their ultimate success. This book did a great deal to inform my thinking. I do hope for a perfect storm of unique opportunities for each of them, but my strongest hope still remains their ultimate health and happiness. Thank you, Mr. Gladwell for the heaping mouthful of food for thought.",1
720,"Great book, good price. Great book, good price",2
721,"Blink was better but Outliers was still good. I read this book mostly cause I loved Blink. My attitude towards Gladwell has not changed,he is a great writer who raises thought provoking theories. Furthermore his introspective sociological theories are thoroughly backed with good logic.",1
722,A Must read for anyone and everyone who is on a journey of self development. Loved every word,2
723,"Not what I expected but a great read!. I was expecting a self help book on trying to be sucessful. No dont be mislead this is a book not telling you have success in your own control but rather the opposite. Its still a great book, that is written amazingly with some really relevant and interesting examples. The chapter on Bill Gates is a story I have found myself telling others about",2
724,"Some more interesting than others. While some of the stories and examples in this collection are, by far, more interesting than others, overall this was a really insightful read - quick, too!",1
725,"Intelligence does not necessarily guarantee success.. This challenged many of my long held beliefs that intelligent people will reach the top of their fields, whether in industry, business or sport. So much of success in life depends on when and where you were born and opportunities offered. I will be quoting from this book often. An excellent read.",2
726,"Compelling insights to see beyond the surface. Gladwell redefines ""outlier"" through an expansive study of the lives of successful people. His explanations take you far deeper than ""luck"" and ""hard work"". If it doesn't prompt you to serious introspection you need to read it again!",2
727,"Interesting but repetitive. This book was recommended to me by a friend, but it wasn't full of inspirational stories of success like I was expecting, rather talking about how people's successes are more a result of the opportunities they have been given. Contained interesting accounts of black box recordings though.",0
728,"Extremely fascinating and eye opening.. I really appreciated the fact that Gladwell did not try to say that he had found the single key to success. He made it clear that many factors contribute to success, and his examples really help the reader understand those different factors. It is easy to think that someone is successful because they are smarter, were given great advantages, worked harder, or were just plain lucky. This book helps one understand the role that intelligence, great opportunity, hard work, luck etc... actually play in success. I think this would be a great read for a book club. There is a lot that invites discussion. I usually read fiction, but am very glad that a friend recommended this book.",2

730,"Worth a listen, but seems like cherry picking.. Definitely some good points, and worth a listen, but I think a lot of his points are skewed. I do think environment matters, but the point he's making is that someone like Bill Gates wouldn't be in the place he's at without a lot of help. Sure. Duh. But how many other people had similar benefits/privileges and simply wasted them? I've sure seen people with tons of blessings heaped on them simply waste their gifts with virtually identical social factors (siblings, etc.). Could you point out differences? Sure. But I think personal factors aren't given enough weight in his calculations.",1
731,FascinAting. Couldn’t put this one down...a fascinating read!!!,2
732,Very interesting. I thought the examples were very intriguing. I would like to see some examples of what to do if you are not in the fortunate categories. How can you still become successful.,1
733,"Best book I've read in a long time. For a non-fiction book, this was entertaining like no other! Gladwell defines success as a coming together of as much opportunity as hardwork, instead of being defined by the genius of an individual. It was hard not to think about myself and people I know as I read it, and it humbled me many times and also infuriated me many other times. There might be some over generalizations based on the examples given in the book, but it never strayed from its overall ethos in my opinion.",2
734,Great Read. Interesting thesis on the pathway to success. I enjoyed even more the second time. It should be assigned reading in high school.,1
735,"Advice from a teen: don't even think about looking at it.. It's boring, it's confusing (it contradicts itself every other chapter), and I regret ever hearing about this book, much less having to read it for school.",0

740,First 4 chapters are great and last 3 are dragging. First 4 chapters are great and last 3 are dragging. Author should have cut the boring story of the air crash investigation.,1
741,"Interesting but not extraordinary. A book loaded with interesting insights, Outliers is compelling in the way that chain emails capture the attention with their surprising stories. But Gladwell's preoccupation with explaining individual greatness as the product of its unique environment seemed a socialist twist on suggesting that greatness is possible and achieved not by individual effort, but by circumstance, and therefor failure to achieve excellence is acceptable because the circumstances were obviously not favorable or conducive.",0
742,Five Stars. Good Book,2
743,"Makes you think. ""Outliers"" may not persuade you, but it will make you rethink the meaning of the words like ""intelligence"" and ""talent."" It will also make you question how much of ""success"" really comes from culture, cohort, and circumstance.",1
744,"My favorite Gladwell book so far. My favorite Gladwell book so far. I think I have read at least four of his books. Certain chapters really captivated me. Some of those were about birthdates, timing and certain things that had to be lined up for certain people to succeed, the 10,000-hour concept, and the plane crash chapter.",2
745,"DISAPPOINTED in Gladwell: Bad Journalism to make a point to wrong audience.... I like Malcolm, I really do. However I can not endorse with clear conscience his recent book. This book is fraught with incomplete and sometimes downright inaccurate statistics that are made up to make the point that Malcolm is trying to make (see some examples below).",0
746,Luck vs Success. I think the use of data can prove what ever you want it too. However I also think that luck has a lot more to do with even our own individual success than we're willing to admit. Over all it was a pleasant read that got me to look at the idea of success with fresh eyes.,1

Read this for light entertainment or for much deeper reflection - it has the uncanny ability to reach eash of us where we are.",1
749,"Very Good. Must read book for everyone! It keeps you motivated with the purpose and skills you want to acquire. I loved this book throughout and it has a great connection. Don’t bother yourself with the difficult circumstance, you should keep going and excel yourself with the skills and follow your passion one day you will strike the target and achieve your goals. Must read for those who want to achieve something good in life and who dream big",1
750,Fascinating read. Fascinating read - thoroughly recommend Malcolm Gladwell's books,2
751,"Good but fairly general info.... This book was recommended to me by a professor of mine. It has a lot of good/interesting information in it but I'm not 100% certain that all the thoughts in this book are well laid out or at least aren't described thoroughly enough to convince me. I would still consider it a good read, like most of Gladwell's material.",0
752,"WOW!!!. This is a very very very special book that puts so much clarity, so eloquently, on such complexity. Truly magical!",2
753,"Another gem. Here is another great book by Malcolm Gladwell. A different way of looking at success and achievement. If you liked his other books, you'll like this one, too.",1
754,No one is a special snowflake - it's all down to science and circumstance. What you realize after reading the book: individual success is fake - oftentimes it is the result of multiple factors contributing to a single outcome.,2

756,Book for Outliers. The examples for the application not appear at my country.,1
757,"I Recommend. I loved this book! Never boring, very interesting, gave me a new perspective on the importance of work ethic!",2
758,"Gladwell is a genius. Malcolm Gladwell is uniquely gifted in being able to first identify common assumptions and beliefs of social importance that are in fact questionable, then to make inspired connections that build a case for a contrarian perspective, and finally to present the evidence in a totally compelling, non-patronising and inspirational way. I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance. We should treasure visonaries and communicators like Malcolm Gladwell.",2

This book includes remarkable stories that I found fascinating and inspiring. This book is about many different people and stories from different walks of life and how they were able to find success. Malcolm Gladwell explored how culture, family, opportunities, and time periods shaped some of the most successful people.

767,Everyone should read this. Loved this book. Should be required reading for all.,2
768,"Intersting, interesting, interesting. Gladwell alwasy provides food for thought. This book is very entertaining and iteresting. I love all the anecdotal evidence althogh he has statistics too. It definately makes you think differently about success. As usual, I'm not sure he got the title right. He seems to not come back around to the idea of outliers very well. I'd title it Hard-earned Success or Lucky Duck.",1
769,"like antibiotics that heal the wounds caused by motivational posters. The most amazing thing about this book is the near-total lack of pat answers, cliched figures, cheap opinions, and the like. It's as if the writer was truly interested in presenting an unbiased and factual look at a meta-understanding of sorts concerning his subject.",1
770,Very insightful. Excellent read and changed my views on why people perform better than others.,2
771,Very good book that came in excellent condition. Exceeded my expectations ... Very good book that came in excellent condition,1
772,"Success - Defined as so much more than any individual alone can determine.. I found this book presents a different and interesting way to look at what contributes to success. This makes you realize that there is so much more to what determines how we become who we are, the chances that we have access to based on so much more than we realize. It provides a broadening of perspective and a thought provoking larger world view as it applies to each and every one of us.",1
773,"A must read!. This book is so good! I love Malcolm Gladwell anyway but it's really interesting to read these stories. If you like the podcast Under The Influence (on the CBC), you'll love this book.",2

775,Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. This book is a really good reminder that hard work can pay dividends. Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. You don't have to be porn in the top few precent of IQ to achieve at the top of your field. Anyone in the top 25% can make it to the top with training and practice. Even the people the average person can have considerable success with training and practice.,1
776,"waste of time. At 3.99, I thought I was getting a deal. Not the first time the ny times list has failed me..... I wish I could get my money back. This book states the obvious, which is harmless. But then the author extrapolates into the realm of ridiculousness. Save your time and your 3.99.....",0
777,Really interesting. I liked a lot this book. Many of the facts presented are mindblowing. Incredible the thinks that can makes the difference. But hard work is the most important one.,1
778,"Interesting facts and interpretations. I agree that successful people are products of circumstances and effort. However, the author elevates the importance of uncontrollable circumstance above hard work and controlled circumstances. In my experience in life, a lot of people, if not most, choose the path of least resistance. Opportunities are there, but they don't take it. Also, much of the circumstances that we find ourselves are products of our of own choices. The author brings the fact that he, by fortune, became best friends with intelligent people, but that was his choice. He didn't need to continue to be friends. I did enjoy the facts presented and the interpretations. Gave me valuable insight into different social and cultural structures.",0
779,Good book with lots of information. Lots of information in the book that makes you reflect and understand how timing fits into many things. Also different pieces of history throughout the book.,1
780,Must read. Must read,2
781,"hypothesis contrary to fact. The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in the roots or causes of success. Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact."" Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing. According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot. Or consider,"" If a million more teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?""",0
782,"A different book. I was told how good this book was so I purchased it. It is a different approach to the subject of doing well in ones work. It gives a good outlook on those who may not be considered ""winners"". It was a challenging book for sure and I would recommend it to all those who want to succeed in life.",1
783,"Intelligence does not necessarily guarantee success.. This challenged many of my long held beliefs that intelligent people will reach the top of their fields, whether in industry, business or sport. So much of success in life depends on when and where you were born and opportunities offered. I will be quoting from this book often. An excellent read.",2
784,Great idea but terrible writing. The original idea of this book 5/5.,0
785,"great title, thought-provoking findings. great title, thought-provoking findings, especially with the notion of predisposition and precondition of some of the personal (and broad cultural) success stories told by the author",1
786,"Completely facinating. Wow, anyone who teaches or is in business should read this book. It opens your eyes as to demographics and why some people succeed and others fail. For example, the National Hockey League is full of January through March birthdays because the cut off date is typically January 1st for youth leagues. The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5. Plus, once they get going at that age, the older kids make higher levels (traveling teams), thus better coaching and more ice time. This applies to school, other sports, and other facets of life.",2
787,Excellent!. I love this book so excited to read it . Get it super cheap and it’s in better condition than i was expecting! Thanks,2
788,Three Stars. It is ok,0
789,"Very interesting!. Fascinating!! Some of it just makes sense. I typically do not enjoy books about too much science/stats/charts/etc and to be honest skip over that. However, in this book it was easy to read and to understand. It was a very good balance for me.",2
790,Encouraging tool. Excellent life examples that help to make a plan or mision to accomplish a life project. Everybody can make a difference!,1

793,Eye opening. Malcolm Gladwell relates some very compelling arguments and data points in this novel. A must read,2
794,Insiteful read. Practical demonstration of theory which can be applied to lots of situations especially liked the air safety chapters and the paddy fields,1
795,"May the odds be ever in your favor.. An interesting, thought provoking and entertaining read. Timing, preparation, and opportunity. 2/3 of which is out of your control. Good Luck takes on a whole new flavor as Gladwell presents a series of fascinating case studies showing the highs and lows of success and reminding us all how blessed we are.",2
796,"Excellent read. I bought this book originally as a result of the Asian airlines accident in San Francisco. I found the cultural insight as to what went on in the cockpit fascinating. As a pilot, I know that two pilot operations are inherently more safe than a single pilot. I will not be flying any Asian airlines anytime in the future! This book appears to be well researched and thought out, I learned quite a bit having read this. The book became drawn out at the end. It unnecessarily went over same material discussed earlier in the book.",1
797,Brilliant!. An interesting account of some of the world greatest and those outliners that may be less known. The book was gripping from start to finish.,2
798,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful.... I really enjoyed the diverse fields and examples from which Gladwell draws to make his points. I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York). Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds. Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct. Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis. A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",1
799,"Thought provoking, yet easy to read. Having read his previous 2 books I pretty much knew what to expect from this one with respect to writing style. Gladwell's books are well written, very easy to read, and short. He lays out his thesis through a series of anecdotes, almost a set of magazine articles, which labor the point a little too long. Each anecdote is supported by data, but not to the point of overwhelming the reader, and certainly not ""comprehensive"" data on the topic.",1
800,"Gladwell makes a great case for ONE important aspect of success.. If you’re looking for motivation or ways to boost your chances of success, you may be disappointed. The author makes an excellent case for background including culture, the year that you were born, and opportunities handed down as being the most important reason behind success. However, he neglects to mention the importance of mindset as well as personality traits such as self awareness and stepping out of your comfort zone in order to PUT yourself in positions to receive more opportunities which I’m sure many would argue are the other major factors in success. Regardless, this book is still worth a listen as you will gain more insight into one of the many aspects of what makes successful people.",1
801,From the quality of the paperbook it is easy to tell that it is a duplicate book.. It looked like a duplicate book. You can easily tell the book is duplicate from the quality of the paper book. I picked a copy from barnes and nobles.,0
802,"Good book but repetitive. I kind of liked the book at first but then it became a bit repetitive for me. Like, okay, I get it, Malcolm. I didn't expect it to be a bunch of examples to prove the same point. I started skipping them towards the end.",1
803,Great Read. Would recommend.. Similar writing to his other works. I've really enjoyed the way he thinks.,1
804,"Interesting. Had to read this for school, honestly I was not at all excited to read this book. But after starting, overall it’s actually pretty good and interesting, I found I read my way through pretty quickly, it had its slow moments/less interesting but overall a pretty decent book.",1
805,"Thought provoking. I enjoyed hearing the author read his book about interesting and compelling considerations as to why people and businesses are successful. This book is somewhat drawn out and redundant, however, the author makes his point of view clear.",1
806,Outliers. I disliked this book because it was slanted towards Caucasian examples of what the author term ‘success’and after the 6th chapter I gave up. It seemed that they equated happiness with being wealthy and entrepreneurial.,0
807,"Thoughtful. This was an eye opening book, it was consistent and gave you the opportunity to self analyze and think the situations in the book for yourself. It was open minded, but it had a clear message. Certainly recommend for those who want to dig deeper into the meaning of success.",1
808,"Gladwell's Outliers Connected to the Teachings In a 12th Grade English Class. Through the reading of the novel Outliers I have concluded that this particular book contrasts very well with the lessons being taught in my senior English class. Throughout the entire course we are connecting everything we learn to one essential question. To what extent do time and place define a person? I feel that Gladwell's Outliers is a great example of real life situations that connect perfectly to this question. Gladwell talks a lot about success and why and how a person gains it. This is the base of the essential question I am studying in my class because success is one of the main things that defines a person. Every chapter in this book relates to the essential question in one way or another. In the chapter The Three Lessons of Joe Flom, Gladwell focuses mainly on how disadvantages became opportunities. He tells the story of a family living during the depression and how he gained success. The Janklows story focuses on being in the wrong place at the wrong time and how they took advantage of the situation to find the success they needed. I enjoyed how Gladwell told the story of the Janklows and interpreted in his own way. In the chapter Rice Paddies and Math, Gladwell focuses on how hard work and the right opportunities will give a person success. He mentions the Asian society and the work styles they have. Due to where they lived technology was not available which forced them to focus on their work. He states that they worked harder than any other occupation pore modern era. Living in a place with less technological advantages really helped the workers gain the success they were looking for. In the chapter Marita's Bargain, Gladwell turns his attention over to a young girl who is given a chance. Marita's story connects perfectly with the essential question. She is underprivileged and living in poor community with her mom and because of this she is given the opportunity to attend a special school. Due to Marita's living conditions she was given the opportunity to possibly make it somewhere in her life. If she had been living somewhere else she might not of gotten the chance she did. This one change in her life helped define who she is as a person today and changed her life forever. I particularly liked this chapter because I felt it connected the most to the essential question. Marita was given an opportunity because of where she was living and what was going on in her life at the time. The entire book Outliers reflects the essential question I am studying and each chapter has a point in it that can connect perfectly to it.",1
809,"Outlier. Malcolm Gladwell is one of my top authors, love his stuff, read Blink and Tipping Point, and again he does not dissapoint with his insightful material that just puts things in different perspectives that just make too much damn sense. You may end up getting a new spark of confidence to feel that you can make things work for you and act upon opportunity; and if you can't you will feel fine too because maybe it just wasn't meant to capitalize on certain things due to the place and time you were born in. Cultural Legacy is I believe the most important concept spoken that our Educational institutions should implement and be able to provide that to a child to be able to perform better in life, regardless of the socio-economical background. Regardless, a great read!",2
810,"Inspiring Read. Very good read, this book helped open my eyes and view the world in a different way. I always thought that rich amd successful people were born that way, I never knew that luck had such a big factor in it.",2
811,A New Take on Success. This book is the most fascinating I have read that looks at success from a different vantage point. Well researched he maintains his theme that success is not accidental or simply luck. This book should be on high school reading lists.,2
812,Love the time of the year you were born facts. Very interesting facts.,2
813,"A little drawn out !. Very interesting but somewhat repetitive narrative , I suspect the message could have been delivered in a couple of chapters!!",0
814,"Insightful and worth reading. Loved it! It tweaked my perspective on success. this book was engaging, insightful and entertaining. I recently started reading frequently and books like this would definitely make me keep reading.",2
815,"Good but not great. Tipping Point and Blink were a much better read then this latest effort from Gladwell. Still, I enjoy his incredible research!",1
816,"Are you an outlier? Read this to find out!. This is a very interesting read. His perspectives about when and where you were born are fascinating. Practice and hard work are very important to succeed in life, but the luck of your heritage play a much larger part than most would believe. Malcolm Gladwell's own story is proof of this.",2
817,"phenomenal book. I came across this by accident, read the blurb and was fascinated. The book itself didn't disappoint in the slightest. Gladwell writes in a very engaging, readable manner. Fascinating topic...how does success occur? Where does it come from? With compelling research and intriguing stories, he makes a clear case for nurture over nature.",2
818,Five Stars. I consider this one the best of the trilogy with blink and tipping point as the other two,2
819,"This book should be required reading in high school. Although the theme prevalent in this book may seem very familiar to some successful people, it is a good guide for those who think that all you need are good connections and a lot of luck. This book should be required reading in High school.",1
820,"Well written and provocative but a bit myopic. Interesting stories and statistics about how ""life is not fair"".",1
821,Good service. Product was as described. I am happy with my purchase,2
822,"A great read, reaffirmed my beliefs. Malcom Gladwell enunciates what each one of us know deep within their thoughts. There were circumstances and brought each one of us where we are with the amount of work that we put in.",2

825,Very interesting. Very interesting,1
826,A fresh way to look at success. A very fresh way to look at success. Excellent style to tell stories.,1
827,Excellent Novel. This book really illuminated a lot of truths about life to me. I've always had this mindset of working hard but also bring interdependent and needing to take advantage of any good situation. This book strengthened that view and showed me a world of numbers I was completely blind to. I've already recommended it to a few friends.,1
828,"dry but good. This book was informative and somewhat entertaining but a bit wordy and exhaustive in supplemental information to frame any given example. That said, the book was good and I did get a lot out of it.",1
829,Outliers are less mythic than we think in the end. Always historicize is a dictum espoused by Fredric Jameson and other cultural critics when it comes to understanding phenomena. Malcolm Gladwell here adds to the materiality of success as a phenomenon that is essentially not abnormal or irrational—the oddity of success can be historically explained if we keenly study the opportunities made available to a seeming outlier. Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out. Gladwell’s seeming unwillingness to do the academic dance expected of scholars is refreshing: He’s a popular cultural critic who seems to want to make academic inquiry and discovery a layman pursuit.,2
830,Five Stars. Everyone should read this book. I've 5 copies for friends and family.,2
831,"Fast delivery, good quality paper. Fast delivery, best quality for price, have little mark on cover the rest okay",2
832,The Book was old/second hand while the cost was high. The book was practically in very bad condition and it seemed second hand,0
833,A good read but I think the author is overly adept .... A good read but I think the author is overly adept at synthesis and making connections that might be a little far fetched. Thought provoking and worth a read though.,1
834,Five Stars. I like Malcolm Gladwell books.,2
835,"Interesting but lacking. Malcolm Gladwell makes a clear, informative and compelling case, and I definitely enjoyed it and learned from it. However, as valid as his points are, he leaves out a few very important components that should have been addressed (although he refers to it lightly). The most notable is the individual's desire to succeed or even their acceptance of personal responsibility for their role in their success. Very enjoyable, educational and thorough, but with some glaring holes.",1
836,"Superb. A tremendously entertaining read. Gladwell has a penchant for quirky insight and captivating rhetoric for conveying it. I strongly recommend this book, especially for all educators.",2

838,"Outliers: The Story of Success. A very interesting book with some new concepts that I had never even figured were possible. For example, the concept that anyone is ever, ever an ""overnight success"". Apparently, there is no such thing. Anyone that appears to be an overnight success has already spent at least 10,000 hours learning their craft. This book has forever changed the way I think about success and it's achievement. Most of us may be doomed to mediocrity.",2
839,Not worth the time. Simplistic premise based on limited examples. Could have been done in 25+ pages rather than 200+. Lost interest early on in the reading.,0
840,"Feel good book for egalitarians. Worried why you or your kids didn't turn out to be outliers like Bill Gates, Sidney Crosby, Shakespeare or Mozart? Fret no more, it's not your fault. It turns out, according to Gladwell's research, that success is 1% talent, 2% hard work and 97% luck. In other words (Spoiler Alert) there are no outliers.",0
841,"Four Stars. Great anecdotes, good concepts, fair organization. More accessible than most books on the subject.",1
842,"Understanding what makes success helps in creating it; must read.. Very well written, easy to read and follow analyses of factors that contribute to success (or failure when missed), applied to examples in sports, business (computer industry, lawyers), education and aviation. Divided up into two parts; whereas the second part tries to focus on cultural legacy in general as a giant 'sleeper' (unknown) factor, the first part describes and zooms in on seemingly random examples in order to introduce us to the factors that are not generally known or associated with the successes high-lighted/discussed.",2
843,Another way of looking at the world. Another fascinating book by Malcolm Gladwell who manages to see what the rest of us see but to analyze it in an entirely new light. Worth the read.,2
844,Nice product. nice book and delivery boy is very honest 😊,1
845,Super inspiring. What a wonderful book.,2
846,"NOT all it's cracked up to be. I'd give this a single star, but the creativity of the subject is enough to warrant at least two stars. Plus everyone seems to discount one-stars as vendetta reviews.",0

850,Three Stars. as expected,0
851,"There are three types of lies:. Mark Twain once said ""there are three types of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"" this book was written from a point of view that environments control everyone's destiny. Although I agree that environments have great influence on a majority of peoples lives, the author doesn't explorer all the ""true"" outliers that don't meet his hypothesis and ways those individuals were capable of doing so beyond his 10,000 hour theory, which I agree. A final note: read this book with an open mind and understand that you can use to statistics the prove any hypothesis if you don't show all the data.",0

856,"Read this book. It's captivating and well written.. Malcolm Gladwell does a very good job addressing some of the clearly misguided impressions of the modern culture that thinks someone who has been successful somehow stumbled onto the opportunity and got lucky. Well, ""Outliers - The Story of Success"" describes individuals who were in the right place, at the right time, and were prepared to take advantage of the opportunity presented to them. They weren't the blindly lucky...they were the ultimately prepared by thousands of hours of progressive learning and practice.",1

He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line. Maybe I had completely missed the point. Maybe it is me and I simply ""didn't get it""...",0

863,"Great Book with great views, lost me as it went on. Gladwell does a great job of showing you ""the other side of the coin,"" when it comes to success. Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over. Advantages they inherently had. He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying. He picks great examples and this really helps the book. The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)",1

865,Enjoyable read. Having read reviews for and against the book I thought I would read it - especially as it was a Kindle special. It's an easy read and although a little repetitive I did enjoy it and do think he makes some good points. In the end it's probably a little too simplistic in its conclusions but that doesn't spoil it as a good book.,1

867,"I personally learned a lot from the book, I've never thought of. I personally learned a lot from the book, I've never thought of success in  such a complex way before. It kinda made a lot of success stories i didn't understand, understandable. When looking at a successful person, the first thought you think is &amp;lsquo;This person is lucky&amp;rsquo;. Really, success has many different causes, and some causes a person just can&amp;rsquo;t apply to their own life. Some of these causes are birth place/time and opportunity. The random causes of life can make or break the opportunities you have. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of this study before reading the book and it made me think of all the successful people I know and why they might be successful. The book makes me look at the external factors of that person&amp;rsquo;s success first. It makes you feel bad about judging the people with the &amp;lsquo;Lucky&amp;rsquo; title because you don&amp;rsquo;t know what causes they might have had.",1

872,"A really good read!!. ""Outliers"", by Malcom Gladwell. This book goes into a great amount of detail explaining why some people excel at what they do and why others do not. The premise is that someone or group of someones or a something can be so far out of the ordinary that it would be considered an outlier. If you are familiar with statistics, an outlier lies far outside the mean While most data will be grouped within the 1st 2 standard deviations of the mean, an outlier isn't anywhere close. An outlier can be either negative or positive. In this book, most of the outliers Gladwell speaks of are positive. He uses different situations to illustrate his concept and proposes that most successful people are not successful simply because of natural born talent, but because they worked at it. He suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice for a person to become so good at what they do that they might excel in the field. In addition, these people may have been exposed to ""extraordinary opportunities, hidden advantages, and cultural legacies that allowed them to learn, work hard and make sense of the world in ways that others could not"" (p. 19). Or did not. In addition, when and where a person is born also influences greatness, but it alone cannot account for why some people fly beyond the bounds of the ordinary and others do not. People may excel for reasons other than natural abilities - read this book to find out why!",1
873,"A great read!. Gladwell does a good job of finding all the right stories and telling them with style. Sometimes everything flows away nicely, other times it takes a little bit of effort. But he has a good point, and this is a good read",1

Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell shows the intriguing correlation between culture (many generations back), opportunity, and chance and the achievement of successful people. The author discusses Scottish herdsmen from the borderlands and the legacy that leaves with the (often mistakenly derided) honor among Southerners. He discusses generations of hard work by Chinese rice farmers and how that, plus basic constructs of their language, profoundly impact the math abilities of Asians today. As an individual, I appreciate more my (Scottish/Irish) tenant farmer heritage and the role that the ethos of hard work played in my own personal success. I also see how my early math geek experiences (mental math competitions) gave me an advantage in engineering school.",0

890,"In this interesting, well researched book Malcolm Gladwell discuss what the real factors to success are.. In this interesting, well researched book Malcolm Gladwell discuss what the real factors to success are. He debunks the myth of the self-made man who succeeds through hard work and determination alone and uncovers the luck that helped these people out along the way.<br /><br />I liked the way the book is presented. Gladwell takes this information, that some people are predestined to suceed because of their circumstances, and interprets it as there are a lot of other people out there who could also be big successes. If Bill Gates achieved so much because of opportunites he had in high school then how many stories like Bill Gates' would we have if all high school students had his opportunities? By not recognizing the hidden factors to success we are failing to realize, as a society, the full potential of many people. <br /><br />Its an interesting idea and definately makes you wonder about your own life. What has happened that you don't even realize to get you where you are today? What hidden talents do you have that were just never given the opportunity to shine? Unfortunately without Gladwells' extraordinary data analysis skills these are hard questions to answer. Still, if this book makes people even a little more aware of unequal advantages it could be helpful in leveling the playing field.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio, read by Gladwell himself. He does a great job and the book has an easy flow that is pleasant to listen to. The interview with him at the end about how these ideas apply to his personal life is especially interesting.",1

896,Interesting & thought provoking. This book was written in such a way that you enjoyed learning what was presented to you without really feeling the weight or tedium of what was being presented. The idea that “some people are just lucky / better / blessed…” is brought up and disproven chapter after chapter and example after example.,2
897,Highly recommended. I very much enjoyed this book. For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line. This book however brought home to me how much other unique (unique to them and their time) factors contributed greatly to their success. The stories about hockey players and how the slight difference in age gives the slightly older boy tremendous advantage were particularly enlightening.,1
898,"Great read great for teachers, social workers and politicians. Life is not all about bootstraps and hard work. Yes those things are very important but sometimes people need a little help and luck.",1
899,"Outstanding book. But where do I go from here?. This very thought provoking book helps describe how some famous outliers were able to take advantage of the opportunities timing, culture, and hard work gave them. I read this genre of books to help stimulate ideas to help me rise above my own circumstances, or at least be able to help my own children rise above their own. As historic information the hind sight we can gather from this book doesn't help me recognize future opportunities for myself or my progeny. However, the idea of cultural influence having a significant role over these outliers and how that came about was well worth the price of the book.",1
900,"Excellent book.... I was intrigued by this book from the start. Not only is this book extremely well-written, but it also has thought-provoking content that will give you a new perspective to look at in terms of ""outliers."" Malcolm Gladwell presents many people and situations that form certain sociological patterns. He then takes that information and develops theories to explain them in ways that are unlike the ideas that most of society holds.

I was born in November in the early post World War II years. Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce. I struggled until I became an adolescent. With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out. It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation. Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools. My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.",2
907,Five Stars. Amazing!,2
908,"Great read.. This was an interesting book, that grabbed me from the first line. Gladwell provides logical reasoning and sense behind his ""theory / arguments"". Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting. What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way. Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",2

911,great book. I listented to it on my iphone and really enjoyed hearing the author narrating... He made it very interesting and I really enjoyed his thoughts.,1
912,Interesting read.... ...but nothing surprising or really groundbreaking. I heard about this from a colleague who would discuss it in hallowed tones leading me to believe this is some deep treasure trove of truth but actually I feel like this is an exercise in force fitting facts to hypothesis. For every person in this book there are dozens that are equally successful that don't fit the theory and even more that should fit the theory but don't have the outcome described.,0

916,Interesting perspective. I enjoyed the book overall. I liked the different perspective explaining ideas leading to success. The book was well written and read.  I didn't give 5 stars due to a lack of content. I hoped there would be more information and research done. It lays out a clear cause for outliers but I just wanted much more information.,0

932,"A Dramatic Statement of the Somewhat Obvious. This book came highly recommended from a few friends and coworkers as a thought-provoking and almost groundbreaking book about what makes the outliers of society so successful. A big part of the book emphasizes that the rags to riches story is more the result of being given the right opportunity at the right time. When you stop and think about how someone like Bill Gates became so successful, you know that he had to have everything in his life line up. There are thousands of cases of people who are very smart but just don't have the opportunity to succeed and become extremely wealthy. While Gladwell does bring up some good examples to support his main thesis, he often over simplifies things with statements like in order to become a great hockey player you have to be born in January. The reasoning makes sense, but it throws out any other variable that may come into play and it seems like he almost wants to discredit an individual's drive and natural ability.",0

935,"Good read. This is a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to understand how the intellectual edges of society function, and to get a good dose of reality to dissipate the thought that everything in life is based solely on innate ability. Gladwell does well to pay tribute to the fundamental needs of ability, but also demonstrates how luck and timing play a significant role to unlock the abilities of those on the fringe that make the difference between world wide success and being just another Joe.",1
936,Not as good as Tipping Point but still a great read.. No one gets there on their own. Great reality check about how hard work has to be coupled with some luck/circumstance to achieve great success.,1

940,All good. All good,2
941,"Read it with a grain of salt. I disagree with some of his conclusions, however, it's a leap forward from the mentality most people possess. So I would suggest someone to read/listen to it but with the mindset that it's probably not 100% truths.",1
942,"disappointing and inconsistent.. It started with promise and trailed off from their. I have not come across books that actually contradict themselves, but this is one. I feel that it was cowardly in its effort to not actually lay blame for failure and credit properly for success. Disapointed.",0
943,"Question the ""brilliant"" minds and the ""over-night"" success stories. I must admit I am slow the the Malcolm Gladwell party. This is the first of his books I have read. And I am so pleased that I did. Gladwell examines the path of personal success through the lens of our legacy. Brilliant and engaging writing. Highly Recommended.",2
944,Very insightful!. This book helped to bring a new frame of reference. The way outliers become who they are and their path was very intriguing. Definitely a good read!,1
945,"Interesting and Empowering. This book is great not just because it challenges preconceived notions of success, but because it forces one to re-evaluate his or her own story of success. On the one hand, it can be humbling to admit that my social and cultural backgrounds play such huge roles it what I’d attributed to my own inherent greatness. On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens. I may never be as great as some of the individuals discussed in Outliers, but there is no reason to think that I can’t be on a success trajectory of my own, putting in my time practicing hard, thankless work, or cashing in on the values of my great-grandparents. As with all of Malcom Gladwell’s books, he first changes the way we think about certain things, and we then have the rest of our lives to build on what it means to think differently.",2
946,Boring and Random. Not nearly as good as I was expecting. Book doesn't really seem to stay on topic and there is no cohesion between chapters. I really had to force myself to finish reading it.,0
947,"Class Assignment. I needed this for a class assignment. My expectations were low, but the reading went fairly quickly. Some sections were harder to read than others.",1
948,"A different prespective on how success happens. I am impressed by Mr.Gladwell's ability to break down what appears to be a simple concept into different equally important layers that I never would have considered. The research is impeccable, and the conclusions make practical, realistic sense. If you are someone who associates and/or works with people of varied socioeconomic backgrounds, the evidence of Mr.Gladwell's conclusions are obvious.",1

950,"Why is this a best seller?. I don't see how Gladwell has told us anything new. It's a collection of stories of how individuals with successful lives made it because of their connections, upbringing, financial status or the like.

The missing star is because I found as if Mr. Gladwell is repeating himself. The collection of clever ideas and unusual data has become Mr. Gladwell's trademark. But in his previous books everything was based upon some powerful insights. According to my taste the basic premise behind Outliers is not as powerful as the other two.",1

This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'. It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies. I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",0

Gladwell's comparisons and analyses of ins and outs of success, and failure, and approaches to both, are rich with contrasts and challenging thinking. I wish I had read the book earlier, when it first came out, to keep it my thoughts for a little wise guidance. I'll read it again.",2
977,Terrible product. Not happy with quality,0
978,Four Stars. Very interesting book - how & why successful people become successful.,1
979,"Ok Book For Those In The Know, Great Book For Those Unaware. Gladwell's insights are helpful in some ways in describing a very small percentage of the popular outlier stories. But I think it places a little bit too much emphasis on luck and opportunity rather than on gift, intellect, and pure skill. For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things. However, I think if you put someone else in Bill Gates shoes, events would not be guaranteed to turn out the same just because that `someone else' was in place of Bill Gates luck and opportunity.",1
980,"The original premise is compelling, but I got what .... The original premise is compelling, but I got what I needed after a few pages and never finished the book.",0
981,"Interesting and readable book. Gladwell's thesis is that certain people are successful by luck of their birth timing, their environments and given this luck, their hard work. This thesis is really not surprising. The book is well written and imminently readable.",1
982,Four Stars. Appreciated the alternative view of how individuals become successful. It's a combination of personality type and environmental circumstance.,1
983,"We can all be outliers and this book explains how!. What is an Outlier? How do people become outstanding in their field? Are the born with a skill? Do you have to learn a skill? Do you have to be born at the right time? Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”? The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time. Were they the brightest or the best? As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",2
984,Five Stars. So far so good,2
985,Five Stars. Wonderful book full of wonderful stories! Once I started it was almost impossible to put the book down!,2
986,"Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success.... Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success, the value of a commitment to hard work and the edge given to those with a privileged upbringing is worth reading. His ability to interpret statistics within a cultural anthropological framework is a refreshing, agenda free contribution to literature.",1
987,One Star. Horrible.,0
988,"The multiple ingredients to achieving success. This great read makes one point clear - there are several ingredients that will need to come together to drive success. While not a “self help” book, this for me opened my mind to opportunities that - with my special set of “ingredients” - I am in the right place and time to pursue. There are a massive number of takeaways we should consider as a society in USA, particularly in my opinion in suggestions (studies) done on primary education styles.",2
989,"Another Great Book by Malcolm Gladwell. This book really provided some great insights about why some people are so successful. It is a great book if you have young children and want to help set them up for future success (my opinion). He covers a number of topics from sports to business and why some people in those arenas have been so successful. Some of it is God-given talent, but there is another component that you will be surprised (or maybe not) to learn by reading this book. Great read.",2
990,"Another hit. Malcolm does it again. Like his other books, this one is a bit slow, hard to read , and full of data. However it is so informative and interesting you will not be able to put it down.",2
991,A really interesting read. An insightful book that makes you think. It's not a guide for life but it is interesting as a parent to give you more motivation to look for and use all opportunities that come along in life for your child. It's an easy read - not too heavy but definitely thought-provoking.,2
992,"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories. Christine Brown-Quinn,The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.",1
993,"Terrific Read!. Gladwell does a remarkable job of connecting ideas that, at first glance, seem utterly unrelated. Step by step, Gladwell brilliantly dissects societal patterns to explain why various individuals were outliers in history. This book causes one to reflect on all the incredible opportunities and people in ones own story.",2
994,Eye Opener. This book really opened my eyes to how success is really had by the lucky few. Well written and easy to understand. Anyone can read this and come away with a new understanding of the world we live in. This book needs to be read by all so that we may change the way we encourage and discourage success. I am enriched by reading this book and look forward to reading more by Gladwell.,2
995,"Fascinating and Insightful. Outliers--like The Tipping Point and Blink before it--is a fascinating study of phenomena that we all observe but often fail to question and, therefore, do not completely understand. Many authors provide the slew of data that he does, but without adequate illustration it is difficult to connect to their material. Still others are great at incorporating anecdotes but do not provide adequate foundation for their conclusions. Gladwell, however, masterfully combines research and anecdote in this examination of the factors that have shaped the success of everyone from star hockey players to industrial magnates to nuclear physicists to superstar lawyers.",1
996,"Great read. As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, I wasn't surprised that I loved this book. I would recommend this as it is a great read.",2
997,"A good book. A better read than i thought it would be. I purchased this as the kindle daily deal and thought it might be ok but not that good, but i was wrong. It's a great book and i enjoyed it a lot. Some great arguments on why people achieve success, hard work obviously, but luck and circumstances also key factors, as explained in book.",1
998,"What storytelling!. Gladwell’s prowess at building beautiful stories and deriving meaning out of them is unparalleled. The diversity of examples he uses to draw his central theme is incredibly vast, and offers the readers a lot of insights into several cultures and times in history. A very easy read, that lends a lot of perspective still.",2
999,"Five Stars. good value, great book and eco-friendly. Perfect!!!!",2
1000,Good research but crappy spin. The author tries to trivialize the success of others. He basically chalked everything to luck. Such a toxic outlook,0
1001,Highly recommend. Excellent. Good shipping. Product well packaged and perfectly crisp and brand new paperback was extremely satisfying.,2
1002,10000 hour rule. This is a good read. No one makes it on their own and this book explains why that is true.,1
1003,So much great insight. Everyone should read this book including teenagers and young adults. Great perspective and much food for thought. I'll be re-reading certain chapters. Highly recommended.,2
1004,Don’t bother. A waste of money and time period,0
1005,"All In Education Should Read This. This book should be an interesting read for anyone, but I particularly want to highlight the need for all educators to read it. Current educational policy needs a whack on the side of the head. (I write this as an experienced teacher neck deep in No Child Left Behind, and the policy makers' forcing ""research based strategies"" into our lesson plans.) Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily. But it does give the reader a chance to pull their head out of today's pervasive educational group think and consider alternatives.",1
1006,"Some interesting insights, but more proof needed. Gladwell has some very interesting insights into success and I must admit that it opened my eyes to the background of successful people. However, many of the relationships touted between success and social factors are correlative, I would have liked to see him expound further to elucidate the causal relationship.",0
1007,"Interesting. Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful. Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc. I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read. I'd recommend it.",1
1008,"Excellent. Brilliant book and a must read for everyone, especially parents. There are excellent learning points around providing your children with the right environment to achieve their potential, creating opportunity etc.",2
1009,Love his books!. This one was just as good as all his others!,2
1010,"Two Stars. easy to read, VERY overrated",0
1011,Interesting read. Food for thought on what makes some people more successful than other.,1
1012,"A Must Read!. I have always been inquisitive about the lives of ones who make it to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the many other prestigious schools, the professional sport players, and the multi-making billionaires. For years, I stuck with the notion that they were just born this way with some unique, innate ability. I also viewed these individuals as &amp;ldquo;the lucky ones&amp;rdquo;; to me, these people came around every once in a while. Though just as I thought no ordinary person can achieve such a high status, Malcolm Gladwell proves me wrong. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell takes these common ideas and challenges each of them, showing society that the successful people aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;chosen ones&amp;rdquo; after all. hroughout the first couple of pages, Gladwell discusses the lives of professional hockey players. Almost everyone believes that they play at the pro level because they are just naturally good at the sport. However, through research, we learn that about 90 percent of these players are born sometime during the first four months of the year. Coincidence? No, this is rather the result of the cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada being January 1. &amp;ldquo;The benefit of critical extra months of maturity,&amp;rdquo; simply gives these individuals better coaching, much more practice then they would normally receive, and their teammates are ultimately better; this all allows them to eventually become professional players. Although talent is something greatly needed, it is not the major deciding factor in a player&amp;rsquo;s life. ext, Gladwell talks about Bill Gates and The Beatles, showing that their road to victory is not what we thought after all. We find out that they both accomplished 10,000 hours of practice at early ages; causing them to be the successful people we know them to be. Each of them was certainly gifted, but the extraordinary opportunities they faced are what differentiate between them. The Beatles were requested in Hamburg for the most casual reasons. Bill Gates just happened to be in a school known as Lakeside at the very right time. It is through the story of men like these and other people that I learned that we can never make it in this world alone; there are many factors that greatly affect our future. At the end of this part in the novel, Gladwell makes it clear that we should seize any opportunity, no matter how big or small, because that opportunity may be the one key to our triumph. Not only that, but an adversity can at times form into a huge opportunity. utliers even goes to argue that it matters where a pilot was born because that determines their success. He also argues the success of Asians at math in terms of how they grow up learning the subject. Gladwell tackles many topics and presents the flaws in society&amp;rsquo;s mindset in a very logical and sophisticated manner. All his ideas are supported with plentiful amount of research. I highly recommend this book to everyone. We are in an era where people are classified as either successful or unsuccessful and the successful ones are seen as the &amp;ldquo;special ones.&amp;rdquo; In reality, though, everyone has a shot at becoming victorious.",1

There is an interview with the author after the audio book is finished, which I felt helped summarize the book.",0
1018,"interesting. Very interesting perspective. Much of the information is the author's speculation, yet he presents them as facts. This is the sign of a poor journalist and a dishonest man.",1
1019,Enjoying the book.. Its an interesting read. And I have enjoyed the authors concept.,2
1020,Excellent. Writing this only cause its needed... a bit stupid isnt it? you could just rate... It's a far more objective metric,2

1024,"that allowed me to enjoy it so much. I didn't exactly have any expectation, aside from the fact it's popular, when I picked it up and, probably, that allowed me to enjoy it so much.

Nonetheless, Malcolm did a far better job than the other sources through his qualified delivery and interesting real world examples.",2
1025,Really Nice. Awesome book,1
1026,Four Stars. Great book,1
1027,"Awesome Book!. This book is views success from wholly different point of views...It derives unexpected conclusions yet, in doing so, inspires conventional approaches to success!",1
1028,"I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if .... Although the author Tries to make you look twice at what you thought were life's predestinations, it does so by choosing very precise close space situations and drawing conclusions from them. I would normally say it is dangerous to draw a universal law of things from such a finite number of observations.",2
1029,"this is quick read I'd highly recommend for anyone. Extremely interesting, but cuts some corners in how it presents evidence and ideas that are, from my experience in class at college, are more complex that Gladwell presents. However, for a more casual reader that wants an interesting book on genetics, behavior, and broader society, this is quick read I'd highly recommend for anyone.",1
1030,OK .... I am lukewarm about this theory.,0
1031,"Malcom Gladwell is just terrific. His ideas are so out there. Malcom Gladwell is just terrific. His ideas are so out there, yet backed up with facts. I have read all of his books and am loaning this out to all my friends.",2
1032,"Outstanding Perspective. Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion. By backing it up with analysis and multiple cases, creditability results. There is a strong enough case established to make his views worth reading and thinking about.",2
1033,Great info - well written. I heard this author on NPR and heard enough to spur me to purchase the book and I'm very glad I did. The cultural and statistical ties with the opportunities makes so much sense.,1
1034,"Question the ""brilliant"" minds and the ""over-night"" success stories. I must admit I am slow the the Malcolm Gladwell party. This is the first of his books I have read. And I am so pleased that I did. Gladwell examines the path of personal success through the lens of our legacy. Brilliant and engaging writing. Highly Recommended.",2
1035,"Four Stars. Very insightful, very helpful, well written and an enjoyable read.....",1
1036,Pretty Good. I wish there were more woman who were examples of success. It would've been more inspiring.,1
1037,"For some it will form a new perspective towards achieving success. Some people have the illusion of being able of becoming successful all by them self, thinking that working hard and being disciplined are all the necessary ingredients. This people in turn often forget to mention the opportunities and assistance that others make possible for them. No body achieve success without help from someone else -even if this help is minimal, a statement that other books on personal education and advancement also support, like ""Never Eat Alone"" by Keith Ferrazzi. Luck is when opportunity and experience or knowledge meets, which in my opinion summarizes much of this book.",2
1038,"No surprises. No really surprises in this book. Those who make it to the TOP in their fields didn't just get there thru hard work, they had opportunities that most other people did not have. Each chapter has a little different spin on the same concept. Gets a little redundant, but interesting none the less.",0
1039,"A little anecdotal in sections. I love books that leave me with ideas that I can ponder on and this book did just that. The 3 elements of occupational success and the 10,000 hour rule are two examples found in this book. It was worth a credit. Narration was substandard but not so much as to be distracting from the content.",1
1040,A great read. Highly recommended,2
1041,"Makes you think, but a little pseudosciencey. Well researched, written and narrated. I would've liked to see an attempt to predict what future outliers will look like and a reflection on how to use this info to modify the current system.",1

1043,"Brilliant. Very thought provoking, and so compulsory for the mans' mind!",2
1044,"Freedom.... This book has freed me to believe that much, much more is possible for my children. That the greatest things I can give them are opportunities & support- the kind of support that those from a cultural legacy different from mine would consider to be pushy! Frankly, I don't care. They will be outliers.",2
1045,"Interesting take on patterns we may or may not see. Mr. Gladwell authors and reads this text. It seems a hefty read so I am appreciative of this audio narrative format. The examples and cases cited in the text elaborate on his general thoughts and appear to be mostly thought out. There are several cases however, such as the folks in the Appalachians or the Chinese and mathematics, that seem quite a stretch and, for me, not entirely plausible. Not that they, or other cases, are lacking in evidence or researched argumentation, just that what is presented for some of the cases does not make convincing justifications for the thesis of that particular chapter (again, such as folks feuding in Appalachia or Chinese and mathematical ability). It's an interesting book and take on patterns we encounter in everyday life, but I just don't think the justification for each chapter's thesis was entirely plausible.",1
1046,Interesting and thought provoking. Pulling together multiple strands of experience and narrative into a single whole is done well. I certainly hadn't quite realised the extent to which our dates of birth affect life chances of individuals.,1
1047,"It's more than just the 10,000 hours. Nice book.. Well written. Interesting subject.",2
1048,"Another great Malcolm Gladwell book.. Not done reading it, but another great Malcolm Gladwell work. He makes research and sociological topics interesting to read in a very accessible way.",2
1049,Good Read. If you're a thinker like me you'll like this book as well as his other work.,1
1050,"Remarkable. I thought this was a remarkable book and highly thought provoking. So hard work really does and can pay off! There is world beyond high IQ. Gladwell enriches his story with expertly interlaced empirical evidence and 'real life' international stories that makes his case, as he builds it, eminently readable. A must read for anyone interested in 'social history' and/or 'success' in general.",1
1051,"... conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work .... A very interesting read at the start but the conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work ethic, be born at the right time, get the lucky breaks, and be from a middle class to reach the very top in the sport, business or music industries. Well what a surprise!",1
1052,Eye opening. Excellent book identifying the minutiae of circumstances which provide successful individuals the opportunities to develop their talents.

1063,Great book! Interesting read. Excellent book! I loved it and great deal here on amazon,2
1064,Outliers. Outliers is an easy to read well written fast paced book. But not at all what I perceived it to be. It boasts of mapping the blueprint of human potential... But rather was abook of play by play with life history of actual events.,0

1067,"A different way to view success. The author did a good job of illustrating that no one is a success in life in and of themselves. Success requires a supportive social network from parents to the proverbial lucky breaks - getting into the right schools, being born in the right era or even year, having access to rare resources, etc. The author effecitvely makes the case that success isn't ever due solely to innate ability but a combination of ability, support, timing and opportunities.",1

1069,Different perspective. This is a very interesting book that presents a different perspective on success. It looks at how a person's birthdate has an impact on their success. He presents sports examples as well as business examples. Also explorers cultural impact on success.,1
1070,"Worth reading once. Though the book appears to be somewhat boring at one point or the other in what the author is trying to conclude onto, still it has very basic truths and a great insight.",1
1071,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.",2

1073,"Enlightening!!!. We often get amazed about the successful histories, focusing on how a given person has reached the top.... But this is only a tiny part of the iceberg that is left disclosed.... A lot richer and breathtaking succession of events summed with hard labor that is underneath the surface has a crucial role that leads to the final outcome. A must read if you are a parent!!!",2
1074,"Amazing Page Turner!. Gladwell has an incredible voice and captivating story that everyone should hear. His story is easily understood, but has huge ramifications for how we live our lives, tell our personal stories, and how we should think about our society. My highest recommendation!",2
1075,Gift. This was purchased for a student as part of required reading.,1
1076,"Believe the hype. Online reviews can only do so much to enhance the reputation of a literary and intellectual work on the scale of Outliers and, needless to say, the book deserves it's stellar reputation.",2
1077,"Very interesting and enjoyable to read.. I really enjoyed reading this book. Malcolm Gladwell includes many interesting case studies in this book, which are fascinating to read about. It is also very entertainingly written. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about what makes some people successful but not others.",2
1078,"This book is an outlier.. This is one of my favorites in my personal library. I especially love the ""10,000 hour rule"" in the book which suggests that no matter your level of talent or genius it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become world-class in your discipline or skill. He explains why even geniuses like Mozart were not exempt from this rule. The title does not over-promise but it delivers in content.",2
1079,Outliers..a great read.. Outliers one of my all time favourites. Very insightful. Put a lot about success in the right perspective. Great author.,2
1080,Encouraging tool. Excellent life examples that help to make a plan or mision to accomplish a life project. Everybody can make a difference!,1
1081,A profound paradigm shift.. Gladwell sure knows how to turn beliefs and conventional wisdom on their ears. Deeply thought through and well researched.,2

1084,Success Stories. The book was well written. Chronicled great success stories of prominent people. It was informative.,1
1085,"Must Read. Absolutely amazing book, delivered to my door in like-new condition for about $6.",2
1086,"Forced. I loved ""Blink"" and ""Tipping Point"", but ""Outliers"" fell short of what I expect from Gladwell. Not only did the book ramble along seemingly without much thought given to organization, but I felt like Gladwell was forcing data to fit his ideas rather than researching with an open mind. Some of the information was interesting and thought-provoking and some of the book was close to boring. I found myself having to re-read passages because I had blanked out as I lost interest. The best part of reading ""Outliers"" is in comparing Gladwell's earlier writings with this effort and realizing one success does not guarantee another.",0

1088,"Not the Whole Story But a Great Start. As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too. The one thing I feel that I struggle against daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.",2
1089,Good way to kill a couple of days at lake reading book. Was interesting read,2
1090,"Fair enough. I can see why a lot of people can take good things from this book and apply them to their personal situation. But for me, this book didn't reveal anything new and spectacular. It made some fairly interesting and relevant observations and provided proof to support theories well enough. But there was a lot of repetition which always goes against the validity of an argument. And the main concepts of the thesis were fairly obvious, no real innovations. But I did learn a fair bit of History and Biographies. This book didn't change my life but it was an interesting read. And the fact that the author narrated really helped him drag the point across.",0
1091,"Malcolm Gladwell? More like Malcolm Goodread. Sorry for the horrible heading. I'm only 30 pages into the book so far but it is awesome and insightful. Have to read this for a class I'm currently taking, so glad my professor picked this book. Should be an easy and quick read!",2
1092,Not as good as David and Goliath. Left me with no call to action.,1
1093,"Pretty good book. I only bought this book because I had to do a summer assignment on it for AP Language Arts. I'm glad I read it. It's filled with many neat, and interesting facts and anecdotes. Well written book!",1
1094,"Some interesting thoughts to ponder. This is a well-written book that brings up some important things to think about. Gladwell's conclusion that you need to be lucky as well smart and hardworking to be hugely successful is probably true. To get really far out on the bell curve you need for everything to go right, or wrong, depending on which side of the curve. Still it is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from extreme outliers, at least when dealing with a standard bell curve. If you are interested in what makes rich people rich read ""The Millionaire Next Door"", it deals with the more applicable part of the curve for most of us. Drawing conclusions from relatively few data points is always risky but Gladwell shows clearly the a small head start can get you far ahead.",1
1095,"Not scientific yet thought provoking. Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology.

1100,"Very Interesting. Gladwell's thesis of hard work, and LUCKY conditions creating the basis of success (Gates, Jobs, NY Lawyers, etc.) is undermined by his final chapter advocating KIPP schools for poor kids. Schools that drill and kill are the opposite of what creates affluent children's success. And advocating hard work without the other ancilliary opportunities available to affluent kids is much more likely to create ""hard working drones"" than it is to create outliers, the way Gladwell discusses them in the beginning of the book. he book started well, and then mysteriously undercut itself at the end. Weird.",0

1126,"I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommend .... I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommended to read this book in my survey Entrepreneurship course. This book discusses opportunities people have been given in order to succeed. Gladwell argues that it is not just innate qualities, talent, or a high IQ that makes someone succeed, but it is cultural heritage, work ethic, support from people, and someone’s attitude that enormously help someone succeed when taking opportunities.  like how the introduction of this book and the last chapter and epilogue all tie the book together to make it cohesive. The introduction of this book was very fascinating to me because it talked about how a group of people living in Roseto, Italy all lived long lives and it wasn’t because of genetics, it was all because of how these people lived and socialized in their culture that made them unique. I never knew something like this could occur. I also liked the ending of the last chapter that suggested more people need to become successful so it won’t just be a small amount of people making it to the top. This inspired me because it made me recognize that someone doesn’t have to say they made it despite their circumstances, but actually made it with the support of their cultural upbringing and circumstances and challenges they faced. One thing I would improve was chapter seven, “The Ethnic Theory of Plane crashes,” by taking out some of the meandering because it was a tad bit of a long and drawn out chapter. his book is useful to other Entrepreneur students because it provides a positive outlook and inspiration for those that may think they don’t have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. Essentially, this book can help someone realize that they don’t have to let their struggles or challenges stop from what they want to achieve.",1

1141,"A Fantastic Read. Outliers is by far one of the most interesting and unique books I have read, period. The content really makes you stop and analyze the world around you and how everyday occurrences we take for granted can be explained using raw data and statistics. As much as I would have enjoyed reading the book this book on my own, it was also a part of the curriculum for my Senior English class. In our class, almost everything we are learning about revolved around our essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"". You perpetually answer this question in every chapter of his book using many real world examples of people who have found success in their lives by basically being in the right place at the right time. Outliers is unique in the sense that it is unlike any book I have ever read, presenting the information in a factual fashion while leaving room for the reader's mind to wander about to the infinite possibilities that are possible in this world due to certain variables and opportunities presented to someone. hapter 3, entitled "" The Trouble With Geniuses Part I"" is one of the chapters that deals with one of the variables that a person can control, which is the 10,000 rule, in which a person must complete 10,000 hours of a certain activity to excel in it. Your real world examples really illustrate the effort necessary to be successful, and how it is one of the few things an individual can control. Chapter 4, ""The Trouble With Geniuses Part 2"", was my personal favorite because it really talks about how those who have the capability to succeed don't always do due to their environment or the opportunities that are presented to them. It made me realize that there is a large amount of luck involved with achieving greatness in any field of work. I also found the first chapter of the book interesting because I have a first-hand experience witnessing what the chapter talks about. Chapter 1 deals with elite Canadian hockey teams and the birthdates of the best players. Players who were born closer to January 1st, which is the birthday cut-off for hockey leagues, were always the biggest and most skilled in their respective leagues. I found this interesting because in my experiences playing hockey, I witnessed players who I both played with and against who were one of the best on their teams and happened to be born towards the beginning of the calendar year, you do a good job laying the foundation for the book in this chapter and proves how certain extenuating circumstances can be directly related to achieving your goals and being successful. ll in all, Outliers in its entirety is a fantastic read from start to finish, with every chapter giving a fresh and interesting behind-the-scenes look into what really happens when a person finds success in life. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for a new perspective into the world around us and everyday life. Jimmy Salfiti",1
1142,"Great book. This book shows you how the most amazing aren't really amazing because they were ""special"", rather a unique series of circumstances just happened to be right for amazing individuals to achieve success.",2
1143,"the author does a good job of describing both sides of the outlier equation. The individual anecdotes are fascinating, the author does a good job of describing both sides of the outlier equation: Individual preparation and hard work timed with societal changes that present amazing opportunities and results. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that book seems a little disjointed, with different sections that don't tie in with each other. Overall well worth the read though.",1
1144,Great Read! Inspirational!. A powerful new look into success that not only deals with hard work. The author catches ones attention and captures the discussion of success uniquely using sports in the beginning.,2
1145,Save your money!. Thought this book was boring and did not make sense. Birthdays and Cultural backgrounds? I feel if there is anything we learned about success it is that men and women have been able to achieve what they wanted despite their cultural backgrounds and upbringings. Stick to the Laws of Success and having a chief aim to what you want.,0
1146,Great but weird too. Very interesting but also filled with weird correlations that don’t pass the statistics test.,1
1147,Interesting Concept. The book ended quite abruptly. I seemed as though the author had run out of viable arguments. The exposition of his thesis ended when the book was only 80% read. The rest was references. These are fine for verification of concept however do not add to the argument for me. I am interested in the author's theories and conclusions.,0
1148,"Useful. I liked this book. The stories and examples inside were very surprising, interesting and in many ways applicable when analyzing your own path to success.",1
1149,Four Stars. Great book!,1
1150,Four Stars. Excellent,1
1151,Eye opener. Really interesting at a personal level and especially if you have kids or young relatives. You can create opportunities for them.,2
1152,"Intriguing. Have you ever been jealous of someone else's success or wanted to be as successful as some wealthy or talented celebrity? According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book, Outliers, chances are if you were born at the right time of the year, and the right time of the century, have luck on your side and are willing to work lots, you, too, can be on the cover of Forbes Magazine. In short, if you thought success was all about being innately amazing, this book will change your thinking. And even better, I recommend this book, with only a few reservations. he first chapter of the book talks about why almost all pro hockey players are born in the first three to four months of the year.  A large part of hockey is being able to push each other around. Therefore being older and most often bigger than others is a huge advantage.  These older and therefore bigger kids then get chosen for the travel team with the best coach and they get the most playtime. And after a few seasons of preferential treatment these kids are superior. nother huge part of success, that is largely unexplainable, is straight up luck. Why did Bill Gates's middle school's mothers' club choose to buy a state of the art computer? What if he had been born just two years earlier and the technology did not exist when he got to middle school? Or what if he had been born two years later so that by the time he was in middle school, the demand for computers was so high that it was tough for kids to get time on the system? He might not have gotten all that time that he easily snatched right up. As you can see much of success is pure luck. But the biggest reason Bill Gates succeeded is because he went on to practice his programming. ust because of when you are born does not trump practice, and the book even agrees. For example, if you have 10,000 hours of practice by the time you are eighteen, you will be a pro at what you are doing. Want some real world examples? Just look at Tiger Woods, Bill Gates or Bill Joy. The amount that Bill Gates and Bill Joy worked from the time they started programming in late middle and early high school is enormous. The stories that Joy tells of all the time he put in programming blows your mind when you realize there was absolutely nothing else going on in this kid's life. This young programmer and his colleagues loved what they did. So they did it lots, and lots and lots! And, look at them now, they're really successful.  would definitely recommend this book particularly to students because of the stress that some undergo from worrying about the future. But I will warn you, it may get a bit tedious at points. Gladwell's writing can go off in tangents. However, I'm glad I read it and was able to add some awesome information to my repertoire. So go ahead, read on!",1
1153,"Good thought provocation. Gladwell's strength is in his ability to get others to think about the issue and to communicate to a mass audience. The book is quite enjoyable to read. From a critical standpoint, he isn't providing real evidence for substantiating his insights (you get the ""best of all possible worlds"" feeling quite often in terms of his logic), but rather general patterns that he feels should be noticed. Some, of course, work better than others. Overall, I think the main insight, that people don't ""go it alone"" but have help from families, generational advantages, or systemic social biases and institutional frameworks, is something that deserves greater reflection by the general public.",1
1154,"Master Your Passion With Investment of Time or Practice. This is a fast read. And it was provocative on the number of hours invested to become a master of something. I enjoyed hearing about all the hours the Beatles performed in Hamburg, Germany to master their art. And finally, Gladwell personalizes the story with his mother's history and journey.",2
1155,"His weakest book yet.... I like Malcolm Gladwell BUT I think this is his weekest book yet. I thought his previous books were thought provoking, but this one just didn't do it for me. The more I read his work, the more he tries to peg people in a particular hole to fit his theories. If you are not one to think for yourself this maybe the book for you.",0

1160,"Only half the story. Gladwell does identify a series of external forces that shape our chess chances of success. There are things outside of our control the greatly affect our outcomes, but that's not the whole story. The missing half is the individual's responsibility for seeking out the set of circumstances and opportunities unique to his time and place. We may inherit fertile soil, but it is our responsibility to find what grows and plow the field.",1
1161,Fair. fantastic book ..,0
1162,"Do not buy. The book is ripped and dirty, disappointed",0
1163,Good if you lived in 1950's America.. I gave up on this half way. It sounded like a motivation tape for white middle America. Only a passing comment was made about any one who succeeded who was of color. That was a statement about the success of the University of Michigan's program of affirmative action.,0
1164,Great!. Great,2
1165,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",0

1172,"Easy, gripping read. The author is supremely talented at telling stories related to his thesis, linking them together, and calling back to them to strengthen his suppositions. This doesn't appear to be ""research-based"" in the strictest sense of the term but it will get you thinking.",1
1173,"You'll Never View Success the Same Ever Again!. Malcolm Gladwell's writing is simple and easy to comprehend but yet has such deep profound insights. His books like Outliers take modern issues and he finds very simple solutions to them that were there just staring right at your face. When Malcolm points out these solutions, you just hit your head and say why didn't I think of that?",2
1174,"Interesting anaylis of how the great became great. I recommend hearing it more then once to separate the forest from the trees in terms of how it relates to success, and outliers.",0
1175,"Overrated. I feel like Gladwell presents an intriguing question, but he offers no control cases, except for the case of Mr. Langan. As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful. Tepid work at best.",0
1176,"Superb. Ignore the negative reviews, this is pure genius.",2
1177,"Very Informative and Insightful. I though the overall book was well written and insightful. It opened up my mind in terms of how people succeed through hard work, determination mixed in with lucky circumstances",1
1178,"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",2

It's not about luck and I don't know if it can be taught, but it's much harder to get our children moving in the right direction when they have to go through our uninspired school system and even harder to inspire them to greatness if they begin believing in the ""system"" as the way there.

While the author makes a good point, the shift from third person/abstract to first person/personal circumstances and history leaves me less interested in the subject of outliers, and almost reluctant to ask why several hundred years of British colonial history should qualify the author for inclusion in this book along with the likes of Bill Gates. I'm chucking it up to authors privilege, but realize that I was fine until that point; the unbiased and non-autobiographical approach to some interesting characters and psychological concepts about outliers were an entertaining way to spend a Sunday.",1

1212,"Read like a bad doctoral dissertation. I have to preface this by saying I am a psychologist, and have taught psychology. This author's understanding of the value of both the Terman study and psychological testing is so poor, that it is clear that he only used this information to make his point. He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential. He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking. He needed to understand far more about what he was writing. I read this for a book club, and if this is their idea of important reading, then I'm going back to Danielle Steel, at least its escapist for an afternoon.",0

1217,"Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ. Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ tests to write with sufficient understanding about the subject. For example he assumes that IQ scores from various tests are comparable. He does not seem to be aware that not all IQ tests have the same ceiling. Some tests have a ceiling of 165, others 180. So to say a person who scores 165 on one test has a lower IQ than a person who scores 180 on another test may be misleading. It is just as important to know which test was given as it is to know the test score. There is also the Standard Error of Measurement to factor in, which varies from test to test. Some tests give equal emphasis to verbal and non-verbal skills while others heavily weigh one or the other. Some tests are limited to a pencil and paper format while others have concrete objects to be manipulated, so similar skills are not being evaluated.  All tests have predetermined, correct answers so there is no way to evaluate creative, &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; thinking. For example, one IQ test may ask the question, &amp;quot;In what way are a child and a banana tree alike?&amp;quot;  The correct answer according to the manual would be that they are both organisms, living beings. But if the respondent answers &amp;quot;They both have 55% of the same genes&amp;quot;, the response could not be given credit. The ability to find creative, new and inventive ways of organizing information as Einstein was able to do can not be evaluated with IQ tests in their present form. So to say that Einstein only had an IQ of 150 does not mean he did not have exceptionally high intellectual functioning, it may tell us more about the limitations of the test. If a respondent is given an IQ test in his/her second language then it is at their disadvantage. Cultural differences also come into play, especially in vocabulary and in risk taking skills. Then there is the problem of psychological factors. People who are depressed tend to score significantly lower than their peers who are not depressed. And more fundamentally, there is the problem that intellectual functioning can not be measured in the brain as the activity happens. We can only imply from a test performance how efficiently, effectively the brain can solve problems.",0

1242,GREAT Read!. Gladwell does it once again. He provides links and correlations in modern society as to why common issues are the way they are. You'll end up scratching your head as to how he will relate two topics and then he blows your mind with the common thread. I don't read books but for some reason his topics and perspectives ALWAYS keep me interested in the next page.,1
1243,"An interesting look at the meaning of success. Mr. Gladwell, I am currently a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School, and am in Senior English. In Senior English, as in all English classes, we have a central question that all our units and lessons revolve around that structures what we should be taking away from the course. In Senior English, our question is: to what extent do time and place define a person? Your book, Outliers, is the first book we read in the class, and you can probably guess as to why your book was chosen to fit in with our curriculum. Your book perfectly demonstrated how time and place can affect, and in some cases, completely determine the success of an individual. One of my favorite chapters was the one about the 10,000 hour rule. I liked that you pointed out that talent doesn't come to anyone without putting in a large amount of work in. Growing up I was involved in many activities, but I never stuck with any of them because I saw other kids who were better at them than I was and I assumed talent at a particular skill was something a person is either born with or not. It never occurred to me that maybe those kids invested more time into their skill than I did. It was also pretty amazing to learn that even people like Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and The Beatles had to put in 10,000 hours before they were able to be at the top of their field. Another chapter I enjoyed was the one about the Matthew effect. It was interesting to learn how the date of birth of an athlete can affect his or her chances of doing well in his or her sport and making it to a professional league. I feel bad for the hockey players that could have been good if only they had been given a little extra time to grow and develop, like the players whose birthdays fell right after the cutoff date. The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy is very interesting; that something false can evoke a behavior that makes the falsehood seem true. I can relate to this chapter because the cutoff for kindergarten in my school district is early September, and I was born in late August. I am usually the youngest in my class, and one of the youngest in my grade. Sometimes I was not as quick in school because my brain was not as developed as the kids in my grade who were born in September or October. I also liked the chapter about the Asian rice paddies. There has always been the stigma that Asians are better at math, but I never knew where the stigma came from. This chapter pointed out that Asians' talent for math comes from their culture with rice paddies. I liked this chapter, along with others, that demonstrated that a person's cultural background can influence their success. The idea that who your ancestors are can determine if you achieve a lot or a little is fascinating. Outliers was an interesting book to read, and it made me think about what the true meaning of success was, and by what means people reached success. I enjoyed the book, and I think it added a lot to our English curriculum. Sincerely, Michelle Lineberger",1
1244,"Food for thought. I found this book to be entertaining and well written. The conclusions the author reaches, however, are based on less than scientific analyses. I gave the book a 4 star rating because of the lack of science and the many assumptions he makes based on correlations that sometimes are weak. That said, I also feel that he brings up interesting points and makes one stop and think. This is an outstanding book for a group discussion.",1
1245,"An Outliers' Tipping Point. Why this book matters: I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers. When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell. Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience. Many books are a great read. How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come? To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance. Well written book, well researched, and inspiring others to greatness. Don't blink Malcolm, you have created a tipping point.",2
1246,"Good Book by a Eunuch. I enjoyed reading this book, but found it annoying that the author didn't have the gonads to mention the most egregious honor killers. He talked about Southern rednecks but not Muslims. History and truthfulness apparently take a backseat to PC for Gladwell.",1

1248,"Insightful and entertaining.. Malcolm Gladwell has a very successful formula for books that sell. ""Outliers"" follows that formula. This book, like the others which I have read, are rather short.They have a very conversational style. They deal with ideas we all think about daily. They give understanding and practical insight into""why it is so"".",2
1249,"Fascinating. I found this book to be fascinating and it made me think, and ultimately change my philosophy of the relationship of brilliance to success. Using a variety of subjects, Gladwell poses his theories relative to the opportunities presented, hours experienced and mental capabilities of some of our well known success stories. I found out some things I didn't know and came to understand some things that I knew - but had never assembled and reviewed in this manner. I love books about ""people"" - their experiences, attempts, failures and successes - so I found this book very interesting and have purchased multiple copies for my friends and acquaintances - such as this one. You may be challenged and you may not agree with all of Gladwell's conclusions - I didn't - but I think you would be hard pressed to read this book without smiling occasionly saying, ""I never knew that"" and perhaps even changing the way you look at and approach success in life.",2

1262,"Great Book. What I took from this book is that success is largely based on practice and luck. It does a good job at showing how one seemingly minor decision can be the start to a career of success, without you ever knowing it then. It was a good book that seems often criticized by people claiming he twists his data to prove his theories, but a lot of what he says seems like common sense. For example the 10,000 hour rule. If you take it literally, you might think that 10,000 hours of practice magically results in success. That's an absurd criticism I've seen too much of. Take him seriously, and you'll understand that Gladwell isn't saying that at all.",1

1264,"Engaging, but overrated. Outliers has many interesting statistical anecdotes sprinkled throughout, to be sure. My interest was held. But at its core, the book's central theme is simply ""successful people are aided in their success by their families, culture, education and other chance factors. They could not have done it alone."" This is not exactly a particularly profound revelation. Gladwell repeatedly asserts that most people think Bill Gates-type successes are simply due to that person's raw talent and little else. But is that really the case? Does anybody really think Bill Gates could have achieved what he did had he been born in Botswana, for example? What's more, while crediting these outside factors with making these ""outliers"" possible, he fails to note that in almost every case, hundreds if not thousands or even more other people had virtually identical birth situations, yet failed to achieve greatness. Gladwell's goal seems to be an attempt to take the shine off of society's great success stories by, in effect, claiming they just got lucky. But I think the formula for producing an outlier is more complex than that. Too often in this book, Gladwell seems to be profoundly stating the obvious.",0

1281,"McSuccess. This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists. However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful. I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations. After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A. Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause. Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era. Duhhhh. What makes his ""research"" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation. For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable. In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion? Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.",0

1293,"Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers. An outlier is one who has reached achievement in a way that was given as only a chance for them to take. Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers, is a captivating written work by involving many real life situations. Not only does it involve Gladwell's own inferences on the success of life, but with the aid of real scenarios that help prove his point. The initial reaction to the word, outlier is not that of Gladwell's. Throughout the book, the meaning of the word outlier to Gladwell, is expressed as people who are those who have been given opportunities, and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. he book is a guideline and proof of how success is reached. The theme guides Gladwell into motivating subject. He starts with the point that professional athletes are where they are at because of when their birthday falls in the year. The ones with birthdays at the beginning of the year have an advantage with size and therefore more practice times and better teams are given to them from the initiation. Gladwell believes that, ""Success is the result of what sociologists like to call accumulative advantage"" (30 Gladwell). With charts of the professional athletes birthdates, he proves his point. ladwell continues the idea by explaining that success is not just handed to individuals. A computer programmer doesn't just already have the knowledge of how to create life long used software from the day they were born. The practice and hard work, is requisite to acquire the skill. From this Gladwell, comes up with the ten thousand hours rule. After questioning many of today's profitable people, one being Bill Gates, Gladwell finds out that all of those people practiced what had made them who they are today for at least ten thousand hours, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything"" (40 Gladwell). his book wasn't just loaded with interesting facts. With encouraging advice the book, provided examples and research of ways that accomplishments can be reached. By starting out in life with the highest IQ, isn't always the lead way to getting ahead. Gladwell talked about studies done on those who started life with the higher intelligence and ended up nowhere. ladwell almost gives a sense of hope for those who are average in intelligence. That is why I recommend this book; because of Gladwell's reasoning that success comes from opportunity, excess of hard work, some start of intelligence not necessarily the highest, and lastly support. ""Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell).  By reading this, it made me enjoy the book, and words from Gladwell. I agreed with his theories at all times. The matters that he had brought up, I had never thought about before. From this it gave me a new view of success and was encouragement for myself to work for it in my own life. With the sense of what it takes for an accomplishment, it makes the reader want to learn more of how to do it and that they aren't as far away from it as they might have thought. For that reason, is why all readers should read this book, because it puts a true meaning on life and where one can lead their own path into the future.",1
1294,I found this book to be so interesting that I .... I found this book to be so interesting that I couldn’t put it down! I will be ordering another one of his books soon.,2
1295,"You can do it too!. A remarkable exposition of how very successful people get to their stratospheric levels. People like Bill Gates. Gladwell makes it clear that these people were not only talented and hard working, but well connected and fortunate to be born at certain times in certain cultures. Should you find yourself outside of this success loop, I recommend you next read Seth Godin's",1
1296,Good read would recommend. I bought this book as a group reading for a company that I worked out. It was a good read.,2
1297,"""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell. Thanks for a successful transaction. Malcolm writes in a clear style that communicates his points so well.. It was so interesting to learn how so many successful people became rich, famous or outstanding because of many environmental factors, not just because of intelligence.",2
1298,Thoughtful look at reality. This book will help you look at situations in life from a different perspective. A perspective that feels like the actual truth.,1
1299,"Beatles analysis a little bit off. First of all, I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a stimulating read and I finished in a few hours. It was hard to put down, and I came away with some interesting new observations that, like one reviewer here said, will make for useful cocktail party conversation. The book has my recommendation.",1
1300,"Interesting and thought provoking. This book was recommended to me by Amazon (thanks, BTW), and I found it an interesting and insightful read. Gladwell has clearly done his research, and follows it up with a fluid and thought provoking journey through a number of 'events' and biography's that demonstrate how the sum of the parts in a given situation or success story play a more important role than an individual incident or skill alone. Worth a read.",1
1301,Love this book - just read for second time. So many useful ideas in this book and love the data that sits behind everything. Well written,2
1302,"A quick read following up the work in Blink. A great read, who's central idea is that the factors behind bigtime success are more than an individual's own work. Whereas Blink shows us that 10,000 hours of hard work are necessary to be considered awesome at something, this book goes into the factors that lead to someone being able to get those hours.<br /><br />It isn't based on the best evidence, though. Usually, we need statistics to explain things like this, and though I'm sure he has a fair amount of research that proves his point (or provides evidence for it), the majority of the explanations are through anecdote.",1
1303,"Great read.. This is a story to read that will change your perception on things. I'm not saying it'll change your life or anything but it will change how you look at things. It'll make you question things more throughly. I enjoyed it very much. It contained a lot of factual information that with a grain of salt, made a social theory on how and why people are successful/the way they are. It shows that people are successful due to the help of other and their situations, not luck. It's a good read if you like theories!",2

1305,It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set .... This book gets you thinking about what we as a society should consider doing differently to encourage everyone to succeed. It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set themselves and those they care about to succeed.,2
1306,Pretty good. Awesome book,1

1309,"Selecting for Success, One Policy and Culture at a Time. I already was aware that many of the methods by which society selects for ""success"" are biased towards many under-represented groups. I just didn't realize how many groups were under-represented: culture, language and most surprisingly: birthday.",1
1310,Interesting perspectives. The basis of this book is that you have to be the right person in the right spot at the right time. The stories are very interesting but it's not a very motivating book. #tagsgiving #sweepstakes,0
1311,Really interesting book about how luck & hard work plays a key part in success. I found that I couldn't put this book down.,2
1312,Five Stars. Amazing book,2
1313,"Outstanding Outliers. This is equal to Gladwell's Tipping Point and better than Blink. It contains fabulous, specific examples of how brilliance is often a factor of early opportunities available to some and not others, from hockey stars to Bill Gates. The book slows toward the end, it seems as if there is filler to make it long enough for hard cover, and I can also make a case that the brilliance is in taking advantage of the opportunities that others ignore or don't appreciate. But it's a provocative, fine read.",1

1316,"Will make you question who you are. This book will make you question who you are - where you come from, what's your legacy, and what helped you accomplish whathever you've achieved so far in your life. It will also make you ask, do I have 10,000 hours of experience in something so far? Recommended read.",2
1317,"Outliers. The book is well researched and interesting to read. It gives you insight about the different cultures and how we are a ""product"" of the culture we grow up in.",1
1318,The story is very insightful.. I have had the fortune to meet many businesses in exchange for developing and designing websites. Every website project is an opportunity and educational. The Outliers is the answer to what we all want to ask thecowners of the beautiful estates we drive by. In this story we get thectype of onformation pteviously only available to researchets and in a time whete Googling information is in you can think of this book as breath of fresh air.,1
1319,Woke Conclusions. I would definitely not recommend this book. The conclusions he draws are a stretch. It seems to me that the point of this book is to convince Us all that there’s no such thing as an outlier. There’s just a bunch of lucky people who are successful. What a silly hypothesis.,0
1320,"Intriguing Yet Narrow. This book suggests theories which I have neither considered nor encountered before. I was entertained to say the least, and important elements of success were discussed and backed with research. However, I cannot accept the premise this book is based on, that success simply comes from circumstances. In addition, his proof and support of his arguments seem quite shaky, and with enough research I am sure multiple examples can be discovered which would disprove some.conclusions he jumps to. An entertaining read with a fresh perspective, but underdeveloped and flawed.",1
1321,Finish in 1 setting. I always finished Malcolm 's books in one setting. I have to admit that what I read is different from my expectation when I saw the title. This book can gives you a new perspective about success. There are more to it than meet the eyes.,2
1322,Enjoyable read. Having read reviews for and against the book I thought I would read it - especially as it was a Kindle special. It's an easy read and although a little repetitive I did enjoy it and do think he makes some good points. In the end it's probably a little too simplistic in its conclusions but that doesn't spoil it as a good book.,1
1323,"An thought provoking and inspiring read. This book was recommend to me a friend; I'm glad I read it. The examples and real life stories shared are unique and thought provoking - the book makes you rethink common beliefs out there as to why people are successful and the real reasons behind their high achievements etc. At times the book is a drag as it builds little stories to make clear, definitive illustrations in the end. All in all, this is a good uplifting read.",1
1324,"Outliers written by Malcolm Gladwell. Finding a way to success can be achieved from reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers. Throughout the book, the theme of achievement drives the reader to want to learn more about how to obtain it. From this, Gladwell then proves his point of the meaning of an outlier, someone who has been given an opportunity and uses it to their full advantage.  Tips of how to gain success are then given which motivate the reader, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything""(40 Gladwell). Real situations are given with proven research, which leads Gladwell to making inferences on the true meaning of accomplishment, ""Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell). The highest intelligence is not required to be successful; it is all based on opportunity, hard work, and support. Along with many other facts, this proposal is expanded even more throughout the book. fter reading the book I felt like I had gained something from it. I recommend this book for the reason that it kept me interested the whole time. The context was inspiring and very informative. Everyone can relate to the theme of this book being success.  However, I recommend this book for teenagers and adults, who might be making decisive life or career decisions.  Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is a superior resource to guiding one's own future.",1
1325,"Complex interesting. A hard book to follow at times. With the inter weaving of how opportunities determination, luck culture contribute to life",1
1326,His best book by far. His best book by far. A great gift for him and her and even for those that do not like to read books.,2
1327,Five Stars. Interesting anecdotes.,2
1328,"Great Stories, with a point. MG is a great story teller which makes you not want to put the book down - and the stories have a point - bonus! Great insights into success and failure. Wish he had explored the cultural ""background"" aspects more. This read also offers very practical parenting and coaching tips for bringing out the best in people, although they obviously aren't labelled as such.",2
1329,"Meh.. a little patronizing at times. get to the point, Gladwell!",1
1330,Good. Good,1

Same formatting, same pacing, same kind of examples, but obviously the examples themselves are different. I thoroughly enjoy them all. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to learn and absorb factoids for future retrieval. This book is full of 'em.",2

1342,Good. Excellent Read! Highly recommend! Arrived quickly. No issues,2
1343,"Great Insight!. Absolutely LOVED this insightful book. I think it should be required reading of every educator in America (and every airline school in America!) What he writes about makes so much sense when seen from his research. I'm amazed that some people did not appreciate the book. I thought it was organized, very well written, and the examples were always compelling. I highly recommend this book...you won't be sorry.",2
1344,"An easy and good book to read. Short review but a lot of what is discussed is common sense and general knowledge but the author takes a interesting twist it on things by using real life examples and scenarios, that elevate your knowledge base of what makes some people successful and others not. More over, it is a very easy fluent book to read which also made it interesting.",1
1345,"Outliers: The Story of Deceit. This book was a novel I had to read for class. While I am one who believes success can be attained through hard work, there are other factors that play into success, such as talent. Gladwell tries to dispel this, but in the process places himself in a corner. He claims talent is a small pool, and then uses a small pool that are not talented to argue against. Unless it is an overwhelming majority, there is no basis for argument.",0
1346,"Decent Read. I am generally a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, but this was not one of my favorites. Seemed a bit repetitive. Some good insight, but not so many of the ah-ha moments that I am used to from his books.",0
1347,Great non-fiction. I am on a big-time Gladwell kick right now. I use this book as a non-fcition text with my high school students. I love his detailed narratives mixed with carefully explained data. He does a great job of explaining complicated points and then thoroughly supporting them. This is a great way to show students how to support the ideas in their writing.,2
1348,"Satisfied. This is a good book, and an easy read. It had some interesting concepts and ideas. Very mind opening. I am satisfied with this purchase.",2
1349,Not the content. This book did not contain the content I was looking for. Personal preference. The bookstore sent me an older copy too.,0
1350,Good Read. What I take from this book is that success may not always come from just hard work in some cases. This book gives an overview of the factors behind the success of others. I enjoyed reading through some of the stories and compare some of the information to books like Freakonomics.,1
1351,Gladwell is always interesting.... I always enjoy Gladwell's books. Always great subject matter. While not my favorite of his books I still highly recommend.,1
1352,Educational.. Very informative.,2
1353,"Interesting. The book had some interesting topics but throughout most of it I asked myself, ""how does this apply to me? To my life?"" And, I answered, it doesn't really. It felt like the author was proposing that success is much about the luck of the draw. . .kind of a depressing and unhelpful hypothesis if you ask me. Some of it, however, was useful for possible policy change.",0
1354,Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I .... Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I have read thus far.,2
1355,"Enlarging Your Frame of Reference. If you like to read to broaden your horizons, to challenge your way of thinking, to stimulate new ideas, and if you do not like overly pretentious, academic books that are bogged down in techno-speak and footnotes, then you will love this book. No, the writer is not presenting original research but Malcolm Gladwell is a genious at taking the research of others and putting it together in new ways that are thought provoking and mind-changing. I read this book very quickly but the ideas presented here about success and how it is attained will stay with me for a long time. It has changed how I look at myself and others. It is a wonderful book for discussion and could not be more timely as a we start a new administration committed to change.",2
1356,"Very poignant and thought-provoking!. I gave this book five stars, because of how deep and thought-provoking Malcolm Gladwell is. He dissects the way we value success, especially for those 'one-in-a-million' archetypes that we, as a society, so easily put on a pedestal. Malcolm delves further not just in successes, but in also the inverse: failures (sometimes in somber and heart-breakingly fatal examples).",2
1357,Proof Through Anecdote?. I always enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's work whether it be in book form or the short pieces he does for The New Yorker - but I can't help thinking that he's becoming the era's Proof By Anecdote expert. 'Outliers' is interesting but perhaps more formulaic than it ought to be.,0
1358,"hypothesis contrary to fact. The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in the roots or causes of success. Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact."" Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing. According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot. Or consider,"" If a million more teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?""",0
1359,"My eyes were closed and now they are opened. The entire premise of Outliers is that the successful among us are NOT the product of luck, but rather the hard efforts of work. Sure, certain among us were the result of circumstances beyond their control, but the underlying message is that if you work hard, you can be a success. A wonderful book that should be read by all and studied so that as a society we break down our preconceived notions that some are lucky and others are not.",2
1360,Amazing stories and Challenging truths!. One of the most gripping non-fiction books I've read to date. The statistics were intriguing and the connections made are the result of extraordinary divergent thinking. A must read for those who are interested in success!,2
1361,Another engaging work by an accomplished author. Malcom Gladwell once again delivers an engaging look at our society and how individuals find their way to success. An enjoyable book from first to last -- especially his account of his mother's successful life journey thus far.,1
1362,"Great for inspiration and stories but lacks practical steps forward.. Excellent, very insightful. I love the stories and the examples he gives. A lot of general, and inspirational knowledge to be found here and it's written well.",1
1363,It's all about hard work and mindset!. This book would be a great book for every person to read- it tackles the issue of entitlement and idealization- giving agency to every person and providing those who have both benefited and suffered from a system of entitlement an encouragement to continue to work hard and persevere.,1
1364,"Very engaging. I had read Bounce (Outliers came first) and much of the same studies are repeated in this book so I skipped a lot. But if you haven't, it's a good read and really makes you think about the nature of success and talent. It would be an interesting one for a book club as it offers much to debate such as about nature/nurture, social mobility and how advantageous our beginnings are.",1
1365,"Very dragging. The narrator and the way this book is written was a bit dragging for me from the very start, but after a certain point (not THAT far into the book) everything just got so repetitive. Yes, concrete examples are nice, but that’s basically all of it. He makes his point that outstanding people had certain uncontrollable advantages with regard to timing and general life situation. That point is rephrased again and again and again...",0
1366,"Almost A Book. I gave this book three stars. Two means you do not like it. That is a tad strong. On the other hand three stars (It's OK.) is also not quite right. The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book. So, he starts with birth dates of hockey player but then goes to socioeconomic class (hardly news) and then a extended narrative about himself.",0
1367,Five Stars. Great read,2
1368,"A must for parents with kids in Canadian youth hockey. Having read and enjoyed ""Blink"" and ""The Tipping Point"", it was natural that I would read this as well. I imagine this would be great for anyone with children, not just Canadians.",2

1370,one of the best book i have ever read. I really enjoyed this book. It expanded my thinking and the relationship between different events and ideas. It is an easy read. highly recomend.,2
1371,"Interesting. Had to read this for school, honestly I was not at all excited to read this book. But after starting, overall it’s actually pretty good and interesting, I found I read my way through pretty quickly, it had its slow moments/less interesting but overall a pretty decent book.",1
1372,Worth rereading. Gladwell has a gift for stories that allow the reader to see otherwise unseen elements of life. Outliers is a book worth rereading.,2
1373,Five Stars. Great.,2
1374,Outliers. I got this book for a class. I really enjoyed it and I ended up getting Malcolm Gladwell's other 2 books.,1
1375,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",1

1378,"Good Food For Thought. Outliers is an interesting expansion of the theme that people are generally a product of their environments. Have you ever wondered why some people are exceptional at their professions more so than others? This book offers a few interesting theories in addition to hard work and practice. An interesting theme with at least a few important points to take away, at a minimum it will give you something to think about.",1
1379,Do not bother..disappointing. Anecdotal at best with no real basis for drawing meaningful conclusions although the author tried to do so. Premises weak based on less than valid statistical data,0
1380,"Great Book. I only bought this book because my brother raved about it. What an interesting, informative and thought-provoking book it is. I love excellence and this books show the basic blueprint for achieving it.",1
1381,Three Stars. Not quite what I expected but an interesting read none the less.,0
1382,Very interesting reading. This is a well written book giving a new perspective on success. It appears that it is more than raw talent that determines the likelihood of a successful life.,1
1383,A wonderful book. Outliers is the first non fiction that I absolutely loved. The author has a beautiful writing style. It reads almost like a novel. It has that magnetic effect where each word automatically pushes you towards the next and before you know you are deeply engrossed in the book and just cant put it down! It is a super-fast read.,1

1385,The Victim of Circumstance Handbook. No one is better than me I just wasn't born as lucky as Bill Gates and I wasn't good at hockey as my brothers because my birthday was in September. It couldn't be because I'm not good at anything.,0
1386,"When You Take The Opportunity That Is Presented To You, Great Things Can Happen!. I am very impressed with Outliers. I learned so very much in this book. It was recommended to me because the person who recommended it to me thought that I might qualify as an Outlier. This book will really help me with my purpose in life. I mention this book to a neighbor and she said ""is it by Malcolm Gladwell?"" And I said ""yes"" I was very happy that she had also read Outliers. Since we are working together on a project, it makes it so much easier because I know that she understands what I am about and I know what she is about. To me Outliers attracts people who are willing to make changes in the world.",2
1387,A must read. Reading this books gives you a new understanding of the forces that contribute to our success.,2
1388,"Chance, destiny, or fate?. Malcolm Gladwell takes a good crack at what makes great people great and comes up with their circumstances as a key ingredient - - - the when and where they were born, the cultural background of their families, the atmosphere of the times, the nature and character of their families, and on-and-on. He also mentions the innate drive and ability of the so-called outliers (those who rise above the rest of us), but says none of the success would have happened if it were not for the fortuitous circumstances.",2
1389,"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",1

1393,"A fascinating journey. Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. Outliers definitely does not disappoint. It uses excellent, very specific examples about stories of successful people and organizations throughout history. The section The Three Lessons of Joe Flom has an interesting tie-in to the RJR Nabisco merger and buyout which can be read about in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. Once I started this I couldn't put it down. As always I look forward to reading more books from Mr. Gladwell.",2

1406,"Not very motivating or positive. To say the date you were born, the place you are from, your up bringing or any of the other excuses in this book have anything to do with your not succeeding is pretty ridiculous and de motivating for someone in that situation. Wouldn’t recommend",0
1407,Thought provoking. Very in depth and it challenges your preconceived notions of success,2
1408,"Uncomfortable and unpopular but true perspective of success. Success is viewed from a microscopic level without the hyped up superficial look at success. The penny dropped on why some things are the way they in my own home country. In fact, made me even more bold to determine what the solutions should be.",2
1409,"All In Education Should Read This. This book should be an interesting read for anyone, but I particularly want to highlight the need for all educators to read it. Current educational policy needs a whack on the side of the head. (I write this as an experienced teacher neck deep in No Child Left Behind, and the policy makers' forcing ""research based strategies"" into our lesson plans.) Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily. But it does give the reader a chance to pull their head out of today's pervasive educational group think and consider alternatives.",1
1410,"Intriguing Insight. Captivating scenarios- obviously immaculately researched. While time invested is a commanding observation, Forrest Gump may have summarized all with chocolate.",0
1411,"Disappointed. I ordered 'Outliers', but instead I got 'A Dummies Guide to Vegan Living'.",0
1412,"No surprises. No really surprises in this book. Those who make it to the TOP in their fields didn't just get there thru hard work, they had opportunities that most other people did not have. Each chapter has a little different spin on the same concept. Gets a little redundant, but interesting none the less.",0
1413,"Four Stars. I enjoyed the book. Not a life changer, but definitely worth the read!",1
1414,Five Stars. Interesting read,2
1415,"Pretty good read.. Overall this is a pretty good book. The text is well written and a very informational, however, at times seems to lose focus of the overall topic. Yet despite this minor flaw, this book is a must read. Author Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job.",1
1416,"This book is magnificent. t changed my perspective on the idea o .... This book is magnificent. t changed my perspective on the idea of success, and how to obtain it. A LOT of the factors within the journey are circumstantial, and others require hard work. Gladwell, presents the beauty of that conflicting path to success.",1
1417,"Awesome read for motivation. I must admit starting the book with references on sports were not very interesting since I am not a sports fan, however the whole point was to reference how people's circumstances translates into an opportunity. With each example he gave, he backed it up with reasonable background information.",2
1418,quick and prompt. exactly as expected and received very timely. thank you.,2
1419,Five Stars. Excellent book and I have recommended it to others for reading. Very interesting!,2
1420,"Easy, gripping read. The author is supremely talented at telling stories related to his thesis, linking them together, and calling back to them to strengthen his suppositions. This doesn't appear to be ""research-based"" in the strictest sense of the term but it will get you thinking.",1
1421,Fantastic. Greatly written and thoroughly researched the story of success will open your mind and nip at your heart. Amazing read!,1
1422,"Fake copy. I'm a bibliophile and I expect genuine books to be delivered which, is apparently a lot to expect from flipkart these days. And I'm not ordering books anymore from flipkart !",0
1423,Fascinating information!. I like the way the author laid out his research that led to his conclusions. I had already loaned my first book so I bought this one for another friend.,2
1424,"Must read for those who want to know what makes some people successful and others not so much.. I found it to be a very enlightening read as it was reinforced that success is earned, not given. Circumstances do play a part but not entirely. I recommend this book to everyone.",2
1425,Inspiring book. Very very good read. I just didnt like the quality of the book. Im just fussy lol,0
1426,Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,2
1427,"Best yet!. His best book yet. Still, as always, quite a lot of interpretation, but backed up by much more data then previous books. The book will really make you reassess your view on intelligence, talent and success.",1
1428,"The Outliers. I thought the book would be in perfect shape, but there is a small dent in the spine and book cover. No biggie.",1
1429,Fascinating research woven like a novel. I wish this was required reading for high school. So many interesting peoples down circumstances pulled into fascinating revelations from research.,2
1430,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",0
1431,"Practice makes perfect!!. However, one last significant element quoted from this book is “It is impossible for a hockey player, or Bill Joy, or Robert Oppenheimer, or any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and say with truthfulness, “I did this, all by myself.” Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don’t. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.” which I find extremely powerful. In conclusion, that out of the many perspectives and research done on Outliers, they are ordinary people that administer an extraordinary amount of aspiration.",2
1432,"like antibiotics that heal the wounds caused by motivational posters. The most amazing thing about this book is the near-total lack of pat answers, cliched figures, cheap opinions, and the like. It's as if the writer was truly interested in presenting an unbiased and factual look at a meta-understanding of sorts concerning his subject.",1
1433,"Great read!. This book should produce some degree of thankfulness in those who read it. In the words of Paul, ""What do we have that we have not received?"" Success belongs not only to those who work, but those who were afforded many natural and circumstantial advantages from the start.",2
1434,Four Stars. Most interesting read!,1
1435,Five Stars. EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS ONE. IT IS AN EYE-OPENER!!! DON'T DELAY!!!!,2
1436,"Completely biased and mostly unfounded.. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Malcolm Gladwell has profited greatly by selling people the idea that they want to believe. That is, that success involves so many aspects of luck and random opportunity, that most of us never stand a chance.",0
1437,Well written. Interesting,2
1438,"Phylosophicaly Dated & Scued.. So, I just read chapter 9 from Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. The title is, Marita's Bargain. The context is a Bronx school program called KIPP and inner city disadvantaged kids. The disadvantage being, middle class parents building up their kids during the summer break while poor kids just languish over the summer doing nothing. He upset me when he said, ""It is not the brightest who succeed, If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is rather, a gift."" Got that folks, we are not in charge of our own destiny. You didn't build any thing you think you worked hard for. I just lost total respect for this mans writing abilities, which I might add, he's just lucky he has. He even goes as far as saying, anyone of us could be in Bill Gate's shoes and accomplished the same thing given the same scenario. What a crock.",0
1439,Amazing stories and Challenging truths!. One of the most gripping non-fiction books I've read to date. The statistics were intriguing and the connections made are the result of extraordinary divergent thinking. A must read for those who are interested in success!,2
1440,"Could be half as long. I did enjoy this book, but I found it a bear to finish. Gladwell starts to make his point in the first chapter and then just beats you over the head with it until the end. He is very thorough, to the point where I felt my intelligence was being insulted. Half way into the book o audibly said ""okay, I get it."" Less historical story telling and more application of his idea would have been great.",0
1441,"Four Stars. Interesting perspective and I've referenced it often. Really common sense, though. It is the way life works.",1
1442,Really Interesting Read. Delves into the factors for success and how multiple issues (beyond just hard work and smarts) play a role in highly successful people. It's a good quick read; thought provoking and a book I'd highly recommend.,1
1443,"Mildly Disappointing. I really enjoy Gladwell's articles for The New Yorker, and I've read his other two books, but in this one I found the evidence he presents for his ""thesis"" to be flimsy at best. It's posing as science, but awash in anecdotal evidence. I had a hard time taking it seriously after a while. I would not recommend to a friend except in excerpts.",0
1444,Mr. This product was in no-way as advertised. The book was in a overall poor condition. Several stains on the outside and broken corners of book. I recieved the book on the very last day of shipment terms. Basically the company quarantined my financial deposit for a period of 15 plus days without any communication of the item being shipped. All one could do is sit and wait for the mail to show up. Poor communication during shipping process. Very poor business practices. Not recommended.,0
1445,"Malcolm Gladwell's new book reads like a series of cocktail-party anecdotes. Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:",0
1446,"Yeah but.... Yes opportunity is important. No very successful person I know says any different. I have never heard any very successful person say ""I got here because I am great"". They have always said ""I just happened to be in the right place at the right time"".",1
1447,"How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, Practice, Practice. Gladwell proves that the old joke is true. In point of fact you have to practice for 10,000 hours. This is a trippy little book that amused me with its many ""aha"" moments. Many of the detractors have given this book a low rating due to the fact that some of the findings are not new. For the semi-illiterate such as me - that's OK. I haven't read the other books referred to so I found Outliers FASCINATING! I knew that the kids of my Asian friends were better at math than my kids - I just never knew why. I thought Bill Gates was just lucky as well as smart. I didn't know he'd paid his dues, and paid and paid and paid. I'd heard about all the rich old guys of the 1800's but didn't see any commonality until Gladwell pointed out their birth years. Maybe Outliners is not the most innovative, or the first, or the most literary look at the story of success but it's still a darn good read.....bg",1
1448,"Best spur buy I've done. I was bored in a 4 hour Saturday morning class about technology management. I've heard about this book and was curious about it on why I was so popular. I found out after a few pages in. Mr. Gladwell grabs you instantly and never lets go until the last page. There's so much knowledge, one you've finished, it changes perspectives and opinions. It was a great ride and I'm looking forward to many more from Mr. Gladwell.",1
1449,Love it. Such a good book for motivation!,2
1450,Insightful. This was a very Insightful book. The author is smart and did an impressive amount of research to achieve an undeniable truth to being an outlier. He is in fact himself an outlier from my point of view.,1
1451,"Compelling thoughts. This book kept my attention the whole way through. It is an interesting study, the idea of success and the perception of that meaning. It is also thought provoking to analyze the contributing factors that are present in each individual story of what might be considered great success. And that those factors span across many demographics and vocations.",1
1452,"Interesting stories about inspiring people. Very good book with interesting principles, unique stories about the backgrounds of those we know and should know",2
1453,Really enjoyable and easy to read book. Really enjoyable and easy to read book. A few big leaps and stretches but I didn't feel that it undermined Gladwell's ability to make you turn the microscope on your own life.,2
1454,"Padded but useful.. There are a few concepts (Such as 20,000 hours to mastery. Talent is not enough.) that are quite useful, but benefited scantly from the padding and personal embellishments that doubled the necessary length.",1
1455,"Not a perfect book. There are some great concepts in this book. However, I do not agree with all of the research supposedly backing these concepts. Sloppy research with few counterarguments. I wish there was more in that regard. Read it if you are deep into self development. Everyone internalizes things differently. You may reach an essentially revelation for your own respective life.",1
1456,Pretty Good. worth the read,1
1457,"Born January 9th, but not in Canada. So close!. I like this book even though I disagree with the association between rice farming and field farming. That is the only stretch that he makes and the rest is backed by statistical data.",1
1458,"Very good. I trully recommend this book. It is easy, not boring, and a great help. I would recommend this book on anyone that is planning on having kids or even (like me) someone who has young children and wants them ti have a lead in life",1
1459,Success is never achieved alone.. I read his books because of a Sixty Minutes piece.They never disappoint and show that we are the same of our parts and connections we cannot control. opportunity meets luck.,2
1460,Interesting.. Interesting take on success throughout time.,1
1461,Five Stars. Interesting read.,2
1462,"Great book. Funny and interesting. To be read with caution, specially when it refers to patterns related with dates of birth. Some may believe that the fact of being born in 1955 or so would make you a billionary or a more likely to be millionaire.",1
1463,"Good but not like Talking To Strangers. This was a very interesting audiobook. Gladwell looks at success through a different lens. He examines success not just by hard work but by timing. Gladwell explains the 10,000 hour rule - it takes 10,000 hours of intense practice to become an expert at something. ut success is also a product of timing. The majority of professional hockey players are born at the beginning months of the year coinciding with the youth league age cutoff. Wealthiest men of the Industrial Age are born within 10 years. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, & Bill Joi born within months of each other. ladwell also examines how culture plays a part of success too. However, I felt that Chapter 7 on plane crashes which examines cultural reasons for communication breakdowns during flight emergencies didn’t really fit into this book about “success.” fter reading Gladwell’s book Talking to Strangers, this book was a bit of a disappointment. Overall it’s a good book but not at the same caliber as Talking to Strangers.",0
1464,"A creative, thought provoking and important look at success. I've become a fan of Gladwell's from his other books and this one takes the cake. It is a very creative look at what makes success in some very different fields. When you take the time to read through this, and it does take some patience, you'll get your bubble broke on what we generally thinks makes one successful.",1
1465,Great!!. This read was fantastic and Gladwell again has some interesting insights. The book flattens our sometimes but comes around quickly. Would highly recommend it,1
1466,Outliers. This book is so boring like I want to throw it across the room the scream. Ugh why did Ms.S make me read this????,0
1467,"gives hope to us all that no one is special its all circumstances and luck. this gives an interesting perspective on how to view anyone that has ""made it"". In the end Malcolm says no one is special only perhaps their circumstances were special and in effect it was all just in where they happened to be at any given moment. In a strange way this book both gives hope but also can be a little depressing",2
1468,Fantastic. Great book that shows insight into understanding why certain people succeed. Interesting concepts. I'll be reading all of Gladwell's books after this one.,2
1469,Bought for school hate it. I like the idea but ughhh so repetitive,0
1470,"Interesting and Entertaining. I know Gladwell's stories should be taken with a grain of salt, but this book was a very interesting read. Great anecdotes that make for interesting conversation.",2
1471,"Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey .... 2/3 done the book. Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey references :) Has made me look at 'secrets of success' a little harder, and with a circumspection that I didn't have before.",1
1472,A decent read. pretty interesting study of why some things or people are outliers and his you have to look beyond the obvious.,1
1473,Excellent. Well thought out and articulated arguments about the stories behind true success. This book will make you think. Makes me grateful for the opportunities I’ve had in my life.,2
1474,Interesting Nonfiction. The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life. It reads almost like a fiction book. The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened. He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,1
1475,"A fun easy read. Gladwell is an excellent writer who is able to combine facts and weave it into a story. I had read several of his books. However, this one was my personal favorite. The only real critical review of this book written by reviewers was that there are no women, I was not bothered by this as a female. It is not an overly intellectual read, more something to read quickly for fun.",1
1476,Ultimately Goes Nowhere. This deeply disappointing book ultimately goes nowhere.,0
1477,Five Stars. I love every book that Malcom Gladwell writes. Great information in all his books.,2
1478,"Must read for all parents, nannys and teachers!!!. I found this book so interesting I bought it for my sister and mother of a 7 year old girl. I genuinely believe if parents would put what they will learn in this book to practice at home, the children of our next generation will all be happy rock stars!!",2
1479,"Why things happen. This is an amazing compendium of statistics, research and explanation as to why things happen the way they do. Buy it!",2
1480,"Good thought provocation. Gladwell's strength is in his ability to get others to think about the issue and to communicate to a mass audience. The book is quite enjoyable to read. From a critical standpoint, he isn't providing real evidence for substantiating his insights (you get the ""best of all possible worlds"" feeling quite often in terms of his logic), but rather general patterns that he feels should be noticed. Some, of course, work better than others. Overall, I think the main insight, that people don't ""go it alone"" but have help from families, generational advantages, or systemic social biases and institutional frameworks, is something that deserves greater reflection by the general public.",1
1481,"Everyone should read this.. Mr Galdwell, lays out specifically why some of our greatest Icon's succeed where others do not.",2
1482,Good read!. Good book and daughter enjoyed the story.,1
1483,"The Story of success (book). I""m not received a book. Only CD This CD is excelent good price perfect but i need the book and not come yet",0
1484,"This is not another Blink or Tipping Point. If you've come here thinking that Malcolm Gladwell's latest book could well be a repeat of his previous two instalments, then you are going to go away disappointed. This is definitely not in the same league as the previous two books.",0
1485,"Important, interesting, and thought-provoking book. In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell explores how hidden advantages and opportunities play a role for people who've achieved extraordinary success. He looks at how cultural legacies shape the patterns of our behavior and that when and where you are born matters.",1
1486,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement. This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,2
1487,"Not scientific yet thought provoking. Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good ""airplane books"", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day. Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.",1
1488,It started strongly then rambled a bit. The insights in the first part of the book about reasons for outliers were amazing but it probably would have been a better book if it had been shorter. Some of the later chapters weren’t as interesting.,1
1489,Boring and overrated!. Too boring as a book and audiobook.,0
1490,Listen Carefully Malcolm Gladwell did his homework. It's not a novel so don't expect the highs and lows of your typical novels.,1
1491,Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to .... Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?,2
1492,I haven't started it. I hadn't even started the book this was just the beginning area. 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑 😑,0
1493,"Gets better. Least favorite Malcolm Gladwell book so far, but still great. Much of it just seems too obvious. It does improve the further along it goes however. As the examples become more complex the book becomes much more compelling.",1
1494,Excellent book.. I would recommend this book to young folks looking for direction in their life. Experiences of others just as history can be learned from to shape our future. This books covers both as well as psychological and social view of human psyche.,2
1495,Interesting book.. Perfect read.,1
1496,"I'm Surprised This Book Is So Highly Reviewed. This book seems to me like a direct ripoff of the idea of Freakonomics. The only difference is that it's not as interesting. The book is supposed to be about identifying what creates success. The author sets out to prove that most traits of a successful person are not of their own doing but of cultural or lucky circumstances. The only point that I really like is the 10,000 hour rule which basically states that you can be an expert in something if you practice it for 10,000 hours.",0
1497,"Great read. Thought provoking, well researched, and entertaining. Brings up numerous good points regarding how society helps in the development of successful people. However, he minimizes the drive and hard work of individuals within groups who had same opportunities yet pushed themselves to success.",1
1498,"An enlightening read. Really makes you change your perspective .... An enlightening read. Really makes you change your perspective on how successful people came to be. Can be a bit verbose and repetitive, but overall an enjoyable, informative book.",1
1499,"Another journalist behaving badly, pretending to be an expert. My friend recommended this to me. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. This guy is a journalistic, providing insights and observations on things about which he has no real expertise. Look up The Igon Value Problem.... This quote says it all... [W]hen a writer’s education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong (Steven Pinker).",0
1500,It's okay. I'm a fan of Malcom Gladwell and read Tipping Point and Blink. Blink was definitely my favorite. I h ad some difficulty remaining involved with Outliers. Sometimes it's just where you are when you're reading a book. Judge for yourself.,0
1501,Three Stars. ok,0
1502,Outliers. I really liked the book because it brought in perspective and a clear understanding. I did not really like the fact that there was a little bit of a confusion with some of the people mentioned through out the book. I do recommend this book. It was really enjoyable.,2
1503,"Defies classification.. Overall this book is quite interesting. My disappointment however, lies in the fact that I'm not quite sure I learned anything of value from its contents. Perhaps if you are a sociologist, or you just generally enjoy statistical information, this book may be for you.",0
1504,Worth reading in these times.. Break the conventional mold with unconventional perspectives and analysis. Encouraged reading in a time of social evolution. Practical ideas and thoughts for consideration.,2
1505,Three Stars. Read for school about success puts different perspective on success!,0
1506,... to get another take on his research (not a bad use of time). The theories presented in the book are very interesting and a worthwhile read if you've not read Mr Gladwell's previous works or if you would want to get another take on his research (not a bad use of time). A quite enjoyable read.,1
1507,Interesting point of view.. Very thought provoking. Worth listening to. This book is written well. I may read more Malcom Gladwell in the future.,0
1508,"Good entertaining and illuminating read. It’s a short and sweet explainer for our perception of outliers in terms of people’s success and the reality of their background, circumstances and historical context being supremely pivotal to that success, rather than the traditional “self-made” widely perpetuated story.",2
1509,"Success has more to do with luck than I ever thought. This guy is good. I didn’t like blink, I stopped reading it... I wrote this guy off. Then I ended up reading David and Goliath because it sounded compelling and it blew me away. Outliers follows that same reaction. It is all the things I never knew about something I thought I knew everything about. Success is way more than just being the smartest or the hardest worker. I might read blink now.",2
1510,"Educational but not life-changing. This book is a good read. It does shed a different light in the world and how we think about success, but I did not walk away feeling as though I were more informed on to interact with the world in a more meaningful way. Educational but not inspirational.",1
1511,"One of the worst books I have ever read. Very superficial, full of misleading facts the book is packed with fallacies. I do not recommend it to anyone",0
1512,My personal review. What the author did with the book is what i liked about it.For example is where he tells us how the date of birth determines if you are going to be good in sports. Another example is where IQ isn't about everything you need to be smart. Like i was saying with the IQ it just doesn't always require an high IQ to be smart for example a layer you just don't need a hi IQ buts also a fast moving thinker so you can back up the defendant.,1
1513,A Fantastic Read!. All the Gladwell books are great and 'Outliers' is the most exceptional. Malcolm Gladwell has a gift for taking complex subject matter and making it a pleasure.,2
1514,Worth the read. Took forever to ship. Was a great book once it got here.,2
1515,"Outliers a worthwhile read. A friend loaned me this book for the summer and I enjoyed it so much I bought it for a friend's birthday. I don't buy a lot of books for myself, but this is one I would consider having a copy. The reason for a person's success is not clear cut as the author shows. There are so many factors and the most surprising one, and one a person cannot control, is the time one is born. I learned a lot from this book and would highly recommend to others who are interested in this subject.",2
1516,"This book was wonderful. I had expected a dry. This book was wonderful. I had expected a dry, boring book about business and statistics. That book was far more engaging and entertaining than I could have hoped. Just yesterday I ordered another book written by Gladwell.",1
1517,Highly recommended. So much fun to read and informative. The examples he gives are what make the book a joy to read. I actually learned a lot of good things from the book although I did not agree with everything it said.,1
1518,Rice Paddies. Find yourself in Outliers,2
1519,"Engaging but doubtful. A compelling argument, however a potentially misleading one. The book is heavily based on anecdotal evidence, with barely no statistical data to confirm we are actually seeing causation rather than random coincidence.",0
1520,"Exciting and entertaining!. In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, Mr. Gladwell explains various different situations and stories of success that have happened in the past millenium. This book reminded me of the many success stories that happen in people's lives, and provided some background about how these people became successful. Throughout the novel, Gladwell stresses one of his major points which was ""The Matthew effect"" which explained being born in the right time and place. He talks about Canadian hockey players that have a birthday between January- March usually end up being the most successful out of the players that are born in that year. I don't think that being born in a specific month then it has being born in another month. A person born in January and a person born in September can both be equally successful even if a person was born earlier. While some good players are born in these months, he does not give a clear explanation on the certain variables that causes the early-born athletes to perform better. Another one of his points that Gladwell explains in this novel was the ""10,000 hour rule"". I have always heard of the phrase ""practice makes perfect"", and was curious as to how Gladwell would have explained it. He states that in order to be a professional, you must spend at least 10,000 hours practicing and polishing your art. He gives many famous examples of professionals who have followed this rule and become professionals. I just found it intriguing that such successful people such as Bill Gates and The Beatles followed this rule to be successful. I was always curious to see how Bill Gates became one of the most successful CEOs in the world and Gladwell explained about the dedication and work ethic that he had in order to succeed. One example is the famous rock band The Beatles. The Beatles's story about how they constantly practiced and played their gigs for many hours a day, and thrived as musical prodigies for playing for about 10,000 hours. I was wondering if the way you deal with practice might have an effect on the 10,000 rule and becoming successful? After the chapter about the 10,000 rule, Gladwell elaborated on the story about Asians being good at math and their cultivating rice patties. He talks about how the Asians had ancestors who worked extremely long hours to absorb ""perseverance"" and ""tenacity"". They also have a language advantage, since certain Asian numbers are easier organized compared to other languages, and are easier to say. The Asian Math story actually intrigued me because people always stereotype Asians saying that they are always good at math. I never realized how Asian's language's numbers are much more simpler compared to the complex numbers of the languages and Gladwell helped clarify that. My parents who are heavily old fashioned and follow the Asian culture, I finally realize what they have been trying to get through to me all of these years. I could definitely relate to all of this, and now I seem to fully understand why Asians are superior at math and the explanation that patience is a virtue with the reference to the rice patties. After reading ""Outliers"", Gladwell helped clear up a couple misconceptions of success as well as provide some very detailed explanations on how famous people got to where they are today. I liked the many stories and examples that Gladwell used throughout the novel, and I hope that future generations can read about success through Gladwell's point of view.",1
1521,"Easy read; not many actionable takeaways. I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",0
1522,"What Lies Beneath. Gladwell does a great job of ""looking beneath the surface"" to find the real reason that certain things happen. That statement is too general but in a nutshell, Outliers is worth a read if you want to open up your point of view and ability to look at the world around you through a new perspective. Most of the stories / examples are very entertaining.",1

The many theories that he presents are thought-provoking, and he explains them in a easy to understand, yet sometimes oversimplified manner. Sad to say, certain pieces of evidence that he provides are highly inaccurate or presumptuous. He also tends to commit to fallacies at times. ne example he gave was that Asians do better in mathematics due to linguistic advantages. However in certain countries mentioned, like Singapore for instance, English is the only language of administration. In essence, it means that mathematics, and practically every other subject except for mother tongue, is taught in English, rendering his argument void. verall, its a fairly engaging book, but take what he says with a pinch of salt.",0
1529,Great read!. Loved this book! I read it in two days. It opened my eyes to many ideas I hadn’t considered.,2

Later examples and stories are longer and less compelling. A mixed message on how ""success"" is realized, and what truly leads to ""outliers"". An interesting read in the first few chapters, then a little less so as the story continues. The final chapter, an intimate story of his Mother's path through life, helps us understand Gladwell's key points, even though it is on a different level of impact than previous chapters.",1

I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view.

It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",1

Outliers, I thought, was a very personal journey for Malcolm, so if you're interested in getting to know the man a little bit, this should give you some insight into his point of view. It's a unique one. Taking the journey with him and opening your mind to the idea that your sheer will, determination and grit might not be enough for your particular set of circumstances is exposing, but thrilling. I give a full review on my website - and I especially mention how I feel the book failed, and where we, as entrepreneurs, need to pick it up and march forward.",2

1557,"Not worth it.

1562,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2

1564,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",2
1565,Just getting back into reading for enjoyment-- what a great choice.. First book in a long time that I have started to read for personal pleasure. The book is written well and still has it's grips on me!,1

1571,Very interesting perspective on success. Dives into the lives of the most successful people's backgrounds and how their opportunities to work hard (rather than just working hard) determined their wild success.,1
1572,"I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",0
1573,Five Stars. Would highly recommend this book because it really gets you thinking about life and success,2
1574,good factual book..... .....based on research and facts about why people are successful. The facts endorse that it is circumstances taht make you succesfull...,1
1575,Book you really need to read if you are interested in being successful. For non fiction this a great read. The facts he gives give a lot of food for thought especially with regards to whether or not a high IQ guarantees success or do other factors affect how well you do. If you are in education or motivation you will find it really interesting. We are using it as book group book and it is sure to spark a lot of discussion!,2
1576,Interesting. Interesting but a bit repetetive,0
1577,"Interesting facts but there's more to it. Believing everything the author suggests could place a mental barrier to what you can achieve. For example, if you were born without the previliges of outliers you might have all the excuses for not trying hard",1

The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",2
1584,"I especially enjoyed reading Malcolm Gladwell's interpretation o. I especially enjoyed reading Malcolm Gladwell's interpretation of how society's &amp;quot;outliers&amp;quot; came to be who they are because he focused not only on the problems of our social structure (for example, that the Canadian youth hockey program provides fewer opportunities to younger hockey players) but also on solutions (in that case, by creating more youth hockey league divisions). His book shows us both what it takes to become an outlier and what we can do to create a world where more people are able to achieve &amp;quot;outlier&amp;quot; status.",1

1593,"Outliers. Outliers &amp;ndash; Book Review he book, Outliers, is a very fascinating book written by Malcolm Gladwell. This book is about success and how some people succeed in certain areas and some just don&amp;rsquo;t. The success of these individuals goes way beyond individual merit. The factors of success are opportunities given, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule. These factors help people who are ordinary people become a billionaire or very successful in their profession. Gladwell explains how professional hockey players, lawyers, people with high IQ&amp;rsquo;s, Microsoft creators, etc. came to be so famous. Again, these factors are opportunities, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule. Opportunities given include factors such as wealth, the schools people went to, who their parents are, where they live, and also luck. Hidden advantages are something other people don&amp;rsquo;t see in these outliers just by looking at them. Such as the month they were born and their IQ score. And lastly did these certain individuals have enough time to practice their skills, the willingness to practice, or the motivation to work hard in order to reach their goals. I think everybody should read this book at some point in their life. It is an extremely book. It explains how some people succeed from factors other than individual merit. On the other hand, a lot of people who are very intelligent or skilled don&amp;rsquo;t succeed like they are supposed to, or lack of a better word, like they could have. Everybody believes that the smartest, most talented, best ideas are the ones who are the successful people in this world. That isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case.",0

1598,"Enlightening. There are few things more inspiring in American culture than the idea of the self-made man or woman. These are people who have seemingly risen from nothing to create immense success and, often, fortune for themselves.

1626,Not factual. It is just writer's opinion without any scientific fact behind it. I understand it can be applied to many books in this genre but nowadays expectations are higher.

I will read more books from this author. The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great. All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books. A very enjoyable read!",1

1653,"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them. Here's a good rule of thumb about Outliers: if you are even vaguely interested in reading this book, you should definitely give it a go!",2
1654,"Outliers Review. Dear Malcolm Gladwell, y name is Becca Purtell and I think that the ideas in your book Outliers, relate to the main question that is essential to my English course; to what extent do time and place define a person? In my class, we have a central question that we focus on throughout the course while reading literature to help us draw connections with what we learn. The chapters regarding "" the Roseto Mystery"", ""the 10,000 Hour Rule"", and ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"" relate specifically to the central question of my course. he Roseto Mystery chapter explains how the Rosetans moved from their homeland and settled in a small city that consisted of people only pertaining to their specific ethnicity. The chapter clarifies that the Rosetans tended to have a longer life rate than other people in the cities surrounding them. These Rosetans were not in shape and they smoked &amp; drank, but they showed signs of excellent health. Even Rosetans in other cities were not as healthy as them. Research later showed that the reason these Rosetans had such a life rate was because of their lifestyle. They were friendly and visited each other often. As many as up to three generations lived in one house and grandparents were received with great esteem. They lived in a carefree environment. In relation to my essential question, the Rosetans are a perfect example of how place defines a person. The atmosphere and lifestyle of this particular Rosetan culture enabled many people to live longer than they normally would had they been living in another city or country. he 10,000 Hour Rule also relates well to how time and place ultimately define a person. In this chapter, you claim that one must have 10,000 hours of practice in their trade in order to be successful and make it big. For example, due to Bill Gates' talent, chance, and opportunity to have free programming time from 3 am- 6 am, he was able to found Microsoft, a computer system used by millions of people daily.  For him, time and place played an extreme role in his success. Had Bill Gates not lived near the University of Washington, he would not have been able to use the computer labs at 3 am in the morning; hence he would not have been able to achieve his 10,000 hours of experience. Also, if Gates had not been able to access the free programming at 3 am, he would not have been able to practice his programming. he Three Lessons of Joe Flom is very similar to my essential question regarding time and place. Specifically, the setting of Joe Flom's life shapes the ways of his actions. Since he was a Jewish man in New York, he was turned away from many of the New York firms, forcing him to create his own white shoe firm. The fact that he was Jewish and living in New York during a time when Jewish people were not hired often in big New York firms shows the extent that time and place played on his opportunities.  Also, being born in the right generation was crucial for success. If you were born during the Great Depression, you had many more opportunities for success because class sizes were smaller, there was less competition for jobs, and it was easier to get into better schools. This example and statement show how large an impact time and place define someone's opportunity for success.",0

1661,"Was There a Point to Outliers?. The disappointing and monotonous book, Outliers, did not deserve to be on the Top Seller's List, at least in my mind. The repetitive style of writing that Malcolm Gadwell chose to use ended up losing its impact within the first three chapters. His outdated examples and confusing thought process turned the somewhat interested youth away. he story starts out with a little spunk and a new way of looking at something. An open mind is necessary because buying into his thoughts is key to enjoying the message. The challenge of keeping an open mind served to be a good lesson for future readings, and necessary to liking his book. The beginning is intriguing and leaves you with the feeling of wanting more. All of his evidence is backed up with solid sources and further validates his point, but this interesting style of writing doesn't last for long. s the story goes on Gladwell continues to say the same facts over and over, and doesn't satisfy the reader's feeling of wanting more. For example in the beginning of the story Gladwell touches on the fact that opportunities and time of birth are essential to success. There is a long and satisfying chapter about this subject in the beginning. Just when you thought a new idea would be introduced you keep getting hit with the same idea. Gladwell mentions opportunities and time of birth in almost every chapter. He not only shows how it helped this person, but goes on to explain it yet again. nlike most stories there was no conclusion to his ideas. Gladwell did not organize his thoughts; furthermore, resulting in a confusing book. By not keeping his readers interested Gladwell failed to communicate the message that he was trying to send. Gladwell needed to be more convincing, brief and interesting in order to pull in his readers.",0
1662,Great read!. Will definitely make you reevaluate your own goals and open your mind up to what your capable of being successful at.,1
1663,Five Stars. Quite an interesting insight into prodigious people.,2
1664,Fascinating. Such an interesting read full of various stories of success and luck. It's captivating to read since it examines an array of cultural and societal factors for success.,2
1665,Excellent and Refreshing Look at Research and Hidden Stories and Trends. Excellent book. Had many principles I was able to look at in more depth after for graduate work. He makes some very interesting points about how outliers in data analysis and observation can actually be potentially new trends or tell the story for which the researcher is really looking. He talks about the 10K hour rule and how successes can be discovered. Classic Malcolm Gladwell. I've read it several times now.,2

I found myself making highlights all over the place.",2
1668,"Entertaining and fun to listen to... but.... I enjoyed listening to this one and thoroughly liked it. However, I also noted that the ideas that Gladwell suggested in this book are not of his original thinking... they are researches performed by other people. The way he combines other people's research is no doubt very good, but I also feel that he might be taking credit far more easily than the people that he took the research from...",1
1669,Good service. Great book. Good condition and reasonable price.,2

1678,"Different perspective on the factors the lead to extreme success or becoming an outlier. An outlier needs a good dose of God given talent and they need to work hard. But there are too many people who fit this description that don't become outliers. Gladwell looks at the factors that have led to the development of outliers and makes some conclusions that the circumstances surrounding their lives were more important than talent and hard work. t is an interesting read because his examples include familiar people like Bill Gates and the Beatles. It does get a little tedious as the author goes into great detail making his case that pilots sometimes need to overcome their cultural backgrounds to become successful pilots. But overall, his writing is thought provoking and applicable to us all.",1

1682,"Informative and Insightful. This book was recommended to me by a friend who found it enjoyable. I learned a few interesting facts about what outliers are and, perhaps more importantly, some ways to make just about everyone perform at the ""outlier level"". I suppose many of the observations in the book could be considered common sense. But until someone like this author points out what's happening that common sense is never engaged. If you're interested in how outliers are made - and they are, indeed, made - then this book should be very interesting to you.",1

1684,"Outliers, the story of ""you won't make it"". I found this book a pleasure to read as a great source of history and drawing conclusions to what makes a successful person. Summarizing the traits and upbringing of many successful people in history is indeed an interesting read. However, the book left me somewhat disappointed, almost as if it were trying to say: ""Sorry, you are not from the right country, birth date, race, parental and family background to ever be successful in this age."" After all the reviews and mentions of work partners and public speakers, I expected feeling more liberated rather than marginalized after reading this book. Maybe a re-read in the future might change my perspective.",0
1685,Four Stars. Good!,1
1686,"A simple and good read. The book has simple concepts that is easy to understand. However, I won't consider the book as thought provoking as most of the concepts are not really new. But Malcolm was able to bring very good examples to proof his concepts.",1

I liked the book very much and the thought that the author did a fair comparison of all angles of a successful persons life like, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there. The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention. This book is not only educational but also entertaining. Reading his other book now called Blink and I am almost done with it. I will say that I like this book better than I like Blink.",1

1698,"Great. Very good read, if your looking for something that will curve your perspective of success and how people are successful. Success is more than just about the individual but more about what surrounding that person, the culture, society his Family and even his generation. Just Great!",1
1699,"Great insights, but misses the point.. While he points out all of the opportunity Bill Gates had, everyone at his school had the same, but Gates did the work. Same with the Beatles, Joy, and his own mother. Everyone is given opportunities, equal no, and thus outcomes will not be equal. So to say Gates and all those who are outliers are not responsible for their achievements is false. They maybe outliers because of unique opportunities but they are also outliers because of their rugged individualism and hard work. What nation has rugged individualists and hard work as their core? The USA. What nation has forever changed the world for the improvement of all man kind because of the enormous amount of outliers we produce? The USA. So to say it is all luck takes away from those who did the damn work at their own risk.",0
1700,Good but not too. Good but not up there with 'sporting gene' or 'bounce' but still a good read,0
1701,"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",0
1702,"I like the way he manifested the information. Astonishing book!! His research might seem haphazard for some people, however, I deem it accessible for most people and he also gives us another view to look at the success.

1706,Some interesting insights. There were some interesting insights here unfortunately the author felt compelled to say the same thing over and over and over again which became very dull. The sporting examples got boring after a while and there was a lack of research in some areas - I got bored.,0

1710,"Unscientific. I had great hopes of this book, but was very disappointed. The experiments and tests were so open to bias and the conclusions sweeping or not grounded in what had been established by the ""tests"" that the book lost all credibility for me. I give as an example - the experiment involving students' responses at being inconvenienced in their passage along a hallway. The sample is too small in number, too narrow in population selection etc...also the interpretation of responses was entirely subjective and we aren't given the methods & benchmarks for measuring responses etc. I don't remember anything else about the book except feeling irritated by the testing and conclusions. (If something doesn't interest you - you won't remember it!) Maybe I'm hypercritical because I've supervised a number of PhD students etc, but I can think of so many wonderful authors (often unsung) from whom I continue to learn.",0
1711,"Good food for thought. I've had this book on my list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally had a chance to read it. It's great for conversation topics with some of his case studies (as a big Beatles fan, I love the story of their time in Hamburg and the 10,000 hour rule).",1

1734,Good. Personally I did not like this book much. The author did not mention that success depends on Karma. Bill gate was born that time because of his good karma and his life purpose. I born now as per my karma and life purpose.,0

I found myself highlight a lot of text and if there was one thing that was accomplished - he forced me to consider a different perspective, I was not comfortable with the ending however. I found it hard to accept as a good ending to the story. Maybe because it should have been a separate book and this wasn't the right setting for where his personal story could have gone. The ending was heavy and took the book in a totally different direction and didn't bring all of his points together .",0
1736,It's a stretch.. Interesting background stories but some postulatons are a stretch. It is a writing that doesn't appear to be supported by solid research. I would not recommend this to others.,0
1737,"Epic. Excellent book. Particularly recommended for teenagers (and their parents) who wonder why they might be under-performing or what they will end up doing with their life.

1747,"Where are the women?????????????. Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book. On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!! There are plenty of examples today so leaving out half the population is unacceptable. Leaving out half of the population also makes it easy to justify your argument!",1
1748,"Interesting.. As with Malcolm's previous works, it keeps you interested. He tries to open your mind in many ways, and does so in a less patronizing way than others.

Try it for yourselves.",1

1754,"So interesting, it could be a novel. Outliers is a must read for anyone who enjoys outside the box material. It certainly makes you think. After I finished it, I spoke for 2 hours with the friend who recommended it. I finished it in 2 days with a pencil in my hand so I could underline parts that I felt I had to remember. Even though Outliers is a stimulating, thought provoking work, you don't have to be a doctoral candidate in philosophy to understand what Gladwell is saying. He's not trying to show the reader how ""deep"" he can be, he just makes his points clearly & distinctly.",2
1755,"Of little use. Apart from some interesting anecdotes, the book does not contribute to understanding success. It is obvious to all (I hope) that success derives from a combination of several components among which: talent, ambition, effort and also luck and circumstances. Focusing on luck and circumstances does not help one to understand the key drivers of success that are not in the realm of circumstances.",0

1758,"All of Gladwell's book are super interesting. There is a lot of great stuff in this book. It's an interesting read with amazing facts that support the assumptions. The disappointing thing is that there is no ""fix"" included. I mean there is no ""these people were successful because of these factors and here is how you can position yourself for the same"".

1766,"Outliers: The Story of Success. ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting account of the life paths of several very special people - ""outliers"", as Gladwell calls them. He focuses on the reasons for their success, keying in on the factors that are usually overlooked when we examine their lives. While he does not deny that a lot of people's success comes from their own hard work and their personality, Gladwell adds that his ""outliers"" should be most thankful for two main elements: opportunity and legacy. He splits his book into two parts accordingly. pportunity, Gladwell says, is really all about luck and how you seize your chances. Citing such famous outliers as Bill Gates, The Beatles, and J Robert Oppenheimer, the author shows just how these men were able to seize their opportunities on their way to success. A lot of it was luck, where the men were just at the right place at the right time. But the main idea was that these men worked at everything they did. Gladwell introduces his ""10,000 hour rule"" as the true key to being world-class in your field. he second part of the book focuses on legacy, and how specific groups, based on where their ancestors came from and what they did, are best suited for different jobs. Gladwell writes about the early struggles of Korean pilots, and why Asians are so good at math because of working on rice paddies. Our legacies have a great impact on the way we think and act. ladwell's book is an interesting tale of the circumstances needed for success in the world. Its discussions of the important values we must hold and the reasons behind them can surely help out anyone looking for inspiration, and teaches us to seize our opportunities and understand our legacies.",0

1771,"Atrocious. Seriously terrible in quite a few ways. Author needed a much better editor as this book seemed more like a series of weak articles than a cohesive book. Nearly all the author's examples to support his theory of ""outliers"" were frought with questionable research or shaky threads to attempt to prove his point. Agh. Frustrating to read if you have any intelligence whatsoever.",0

I usually dont read more than one book from the same author (for this type of books) because i find that very often after a big hit, they tend to just repeat and try to squeeze whatever was great about that big hit the had but it is definitely not the case with MG. Yea, the style might be pretty similar which would be expected but the topics and his research just doesnt stop surprising me... Blink, david and goliath, outliers, all great books... I might go for the tipping point some time in the future..",1

Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting. What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way. Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",2

1788,"Mind Stimulating and Fun!. I highly suggest this book to anyone and especially to those who have a strong desire to learn more about the world of success. How did Bill Gates become a billionaire? And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes. Gladwell lays down the blueprint for outliers, and gives the story of success.",2

1791,"Enjoyable, Thought-provoking. My favorite of the Gladwell triumvirate.. Outliers is more observation than advice; as it should be, considering the case it's making. It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked. Similar to Tipping Point and Blink, Gladwell offers memorable anecdotes - himself obviously a student of his own ""sticky"" storytelling as defined in Tipping Point - packaging complex subject matter in distilled, memorable format for those of us making a living on something other than University Stipend.",1

It provides a broadening of perspective and a thought provoking larger world view as it applies to each and every one of us.",1

1800,"Read this book. It's captivating and well written.. Malcolm Gladwell does a very good job addressing some of the clearly misguided impressions of the modern culture that thinks someone who has been successful somehow stumbled onto the opportunity and got lucky. Well, ""Outliers - The Story of Success"" describes individuals who were in the right place, at the right time, and were prepared to take advantage of the opportunity presented to them. They weren't the blindly lucky...they were the ultimately prepared by thousands of hours of progressive learning and practice.",1

1809,"insights into success. This book explores how timing, opportunity, and effort contribute to the successes that people enjoy. It takes a lot of time and effort to become the master of an ability. Opportunity must alight with ability for a person to become a success.

This is a great read.",2
1810,Wired. Its not the best,0
1811,"Interesting Anecdotes, Faulty Reasoning. I tend to like books in the Freakonomics vein, so I enjoyed the anecdotal format and the stories Gladwell relates. However, I found the conclusions he drew from them to be shallow and unconvincing. For instance, he discusses the affirmative action policies at the University of Michigan Law School and notes that the less qualified minority students are comparatively as successful as their ""smarter""* counterparts. He uses this example to support the point that that once you cross a certain IQ threshold then variations in IQ are unimportant, and thus any concerns about these students being at a disadvantage to their ""smarter"" classmates are unfounded. However, he never considers whether the same biases that allowed the less qualified students into UM carry over into the workplace. Firms are as eager to hire minority attorneys as law schools are to admit minority students. To highlight why his reasoning is problematic, consider whether a person analyzing the effects of undergraduate affirmative action policies on their intended beneficiaries (i.e. minority students) would cite statistics regarding graduate school admissions where the same preferences are in play. <br /><br />* Gladwell is using this example to make a point about IQ levels, so I used this word even though I find it inappropriate. I think here Gladwell falls into the very trap he is supposedly warning against by equating accomplishment with IQ. No one takes an IQ test before entering law school. Therefore, the disparity he is referring to between white and black students is in accomplishment (undergraduate grades, LSAT scores, etc.), not IQ.",0

Most of the stories / examples are very entertaining.",1

In his provocative and inspiring book, Malcolm Gladwell talks about success and the underlying factors which propel one in the direction of achievement.

This book reveals a persons success within luck-one is lucky by birth but still work hard to become successful later in life.,1

It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance.

Doesn't give any action items.Constantly arrives at the same meaningless conclusion and assumptions unsupported by any study.

I was surprised and then delighted to find that is just one reference in a book drawing together many insightful ideas to unpick the myths of what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field. But as Malcolm Gladwell reveals, there are other factors, many beyond our control, which should keep us humble if successful and tolerant of those who missed out.

I found the book cloying and I really sorry I wasted my money on it.",0

Outliers develop the idea of successful people as (1) people who are privileged / have the right opportunities at the right historical time and (2) are talented and self-disciplined to achieve expertise in their field.

The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited. Overall, the text makes sense and adds another conversation point for social gatherings or filling time before a meeting.",2

1851,"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",1

While there's no question that timing can sometimes provide amazing opportunities, he fails to look at the exceptions that seem to refute his central thesis.",0
1885,"Interesting but author promotes redistribution of wealth. Gladwell presents very interesting and insightful information in the first few chapters which were quite interesting. However, as I read further, it was increasingly evident Gladwell has an obvious left wing agenda which contaminates some of his very interesting findings. It was especially evident when he mentioned a study which showed black graduates of Michigan Law School ,despite having much lower grades in colleges and LSAT scores are as successful as their white fellow graduates. His premise is there is a threshold of talent or IQ which must be met to be at the top of a chosen field or profession. He rightfully states how much time those who meet the this threshold practice or study is as important as natural talent or IQ. He then promotes the idea that a school like Harvard should set a threshold and then choose who is admitted by a lottery. But there are well known problems with this approach. To meet standards of political correctness, there have numerous cases where the threshold was set artificially or ridiculously low to ensure the ""correct"" percentages of each race enters the school or the job in question. In addition, how could anyone guarantee the ""lottery"" is a real lottery. The study he sites uses some criteria which are very subjective. I liked his book until I realized he is an Obama type, who is bright, convincing but in the end has an agenda of redistribution of income ,power, prestige etc. Sorry Malcolm I should have left the book in B&amp;N when I saw you are a staff writer for the New Yorker.",0
1886,Like research?. Like the science behind the information,2
1887,"Great insights, easy read. It's difficult to go wrong with Malcolm Gladwell.",2
1888,"Very good. I trully recommend this book. It is easy, not boring, and a great help. I would recommend this book on anyone that is planning on having kids or even (like me) someone who has young children and wants them ti have a lead in life",1
1889,"Excellent book. I bought this book for my son, who will be reading it this year in his high school psychology class. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Mr. Gladwell presents some very intriguing insights into success that I had never before considered. The book is well written, making it interesting and easy to read. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to expand their thinking.",2
1890,A Fascinating Read!. I loved this book - couldn't put it down - and when I finished it I bought three more copies and gave them to family members as gifts!,2
1891,"Pretty good considering Cissy isn't a writer. It was raw,honest, open...AND heartfelt. With her all her warts, regrets and memories, this is a story from a Mother who obviously LOVED her daughter with all her heart. It is told from her obvious pov which gives you new insight into the world of entertainment and celebrity.",1
1892,"Malcolm Gladwell continues to impress. I waited a long time for this book to come out -- all summer, in fact. I had the date circled on my calendar and felt euphoric when I finally had it in my hands. Gladwell did not disappoint me! Why?<br /><br />First, of course, there's the intriguing subject matter: wouldn't we all like to know the formula for success a la Bill Gates? Second, it's the expert handling of this subject matter. Malcolm Gladwell always manages to take some pretty heady topics -- like cultural communications and their effects on plane crashes -- and through his masterful handling and style, make them not only understandable but compelling. Gladwell takes you by the hand and leads you through places like the rice fields of China, schools of South Africa, and riots of Jamaica, and explains step-by-step the relevance and poignancy of seemingly insigificant facts that all add up to one profound truth. I simply could not put this fascinating book down. <br /><br />I mentioned the content of this book to my high school students, and they were very interested to hear about how communication styles (assertiveness, entitlement, etc.) could affect their success in college and beyond. That's something they might not learn implicitly, but is completely teachable. Today, I will be passing this book onto an 11th grader, in hopes that she'll be able to find something she'll dedicate 10,000 hours to.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I want more. How long until his next book comes out?",1
1893,"Ground-breaking. Surprisingly well-written, with unexpected examples of success that no one has thought of before. It will definitely change the way you think about success and it dives deep into an exploration and discovery of its determining factors. Overall, go for it without second thought.",2
1894,Good book. Good narrative. Quite simplistic at times but was a page turner,1
1895,Five Stars. Very informative. Answers a lot of questions.,2
1896,"Success of Outliers Is Not About Uniqueness Alone.. For those that wonder how Bill Gates, The Beatles and Scientist Oppenheimer achieved their places in history, ""Outliers"" scraps the idea that it was due to their own uniqueness and efforts alone. It provides data that indicate, birthdates, family socio-economic group, opportunity, communication skills and 10,000 hours of practice are more likely to be the reasons. The book gave me an interesting insight into the secrets of success in the 20th Century.",1
1897,"DISAPPOINTED in Gladwell: Bad Journalism to make a point to wrong audience.... I like Malcolm, I really do. However I can not endorse with clear conscience his recent book. This book is fraught with incomplete and sometimes downright inaccurate statistics that are made up to make the point that Malcolm is trying to make (see some examples below).",0
1898,Five Stars. Great book. Now I see way it's so popular,2
1899,Would buy this again.. Very interesting concepts. Many good examples to help understand those concepts. These are things you just would not have thought of.,2
1900,"Five Stars. I appreciated the clarity, writing and research.",2
1901,"Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right. I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",1
1902,"Biased. If you know how easily statistics and be manipulated, then you’ll see right through this book. One sided approach to his stats and opinions from sports (sorry Mr. Gladwell, but hockey has periods, not quarters) to his reviews in college academics. Some may be true or have a correlation but the easiest way I can explain the bias is just because it correlates doesn’t mean it causes it.",0
1903,Three Stars. Not quite what I expected but an interesting read none the less.,0
1904,"Gladwell is a great thinker. This book clearly spells out a lot of great things that help you understand how people become successful. The answer is very simple. Work hard, work smart, and work a lot....like 10,000 hours. It's just a matter of committing to it.",2
1905,Five Stars. easy read!,2
1906,"Fact Check?. Initially I enjoyed this book, until I realized that many of the conclusions that Gladwell came to were wrong.",0
1907,"Interesting and entertaining read. Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful. Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point. He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality. The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",1
1908,Four Stars. A very interesting book,1
1909,Keeps You Intrigued From Start to End. This book gives great insight into the world of individuals who have become titans of our society. Gladwell does a wonderful job of intertwining side stories with the major plot of the novel. It was awesome to see the diverse group of people he described from Bill Gates to Marita the KLIPP Academy student and how their paths have lead them to success. Work hard and the world will reward you.,2
1910,"Well-written, well-researched, and entertaining read. Engaging examples of how society works and a testament that a closer look will often reveal that things aren't always as they appear on the surface. This book prompted much lively discussion with others who were familiar with it.",1
1911,"Amazing. I like all the lessons in the book, one day I will pass it on to my son to read when he is a bit older!!!e",1
1912,"10,000 steps. I loved reading this book! Learning about the 10,000 steps or 10,000 hours impacted me. The more we do something, the closer we are to becoming an expert. Persistence pays off. But you need time. A book worth reading!",2
1913,"Interesting stories, overreaching conclusions. Gladwell provides some interesting examples and good food for thought but as he moves through the book his conclusions seem to move away from a scientific curiosity and towards a social commentary which diminishes to great measure the hard work put in by the individuals mentioned to achieve their status as outliers. Some of his explanations came across as simplistic and at times very fatalistic. A light enough read that's worth it for the stories if not all the analysis and conclusions.",0
1914,outstanding!. I make no small notion of calling this book one of the best books I've ever read. This should be required reading for every legislator who has the power to create opportunity for his or her constituents. Or any other person with the power to create opportunities for others. Great work from the mind of a fantastic individual.,2
1915,Re-frames Success. I have enjoyed every book Malcolm Gladwell has written - his style weaves real-life examples together to support some big ideas and the examples in Outliers are rather compelling. From Hockey Leagues to healthy towns - the concept of Outliers is illustrated perfectly.,2
1916,"Pop-sociology for the masses. This is the first Gladwell book that I've read. It was pretty good, but surprisingly sparse. He has a knack for tying together seemingly unrelated points and his prose is understated which makes for a pretty easy read.",1
1917,Great book!. Uncovers and makes sense of the small occurrences that end up making huge differences in many lives. Read if you want to learn.,2
1918,"Painstakingly paced automaton delivery. Interesting and thought provoking material, although horribly repetitive and chock full of gratuitous and entirely unnecessary pauses.",0
1919,Four Stars. good read,1
1920,Cheap quality. I'll never order any books from Flipkart. I wanted to gift my friend a book for his birthday. The book I received is of very cheap quality and it looks like a Pirated Version. I never expected this 3rd rated service from Flipkart.,0
1921,"A book for everyone's shelf. Gladwell focusses on and explains the success of a series of significant figures from history and the present day, with penetrating clarity. A must-read",2
1922,Interesting read. Interested read and offers a different perspective on succcess,2
1923,Nice. liking it...,0
1924,"3.5 Stars: Depends on Your Perspective.... As someone whose work is in the field of academic psychology, Gladwell's heavy reliance on anecdotes to support his theories was frustrating. However, I can certainly respect his ability to find connections where others have not and to follow through with writing up his findings in a compelling way. Taken as interesting stories about successful people, I can appreciate this book. However, from the perspective of a researcher in psychology who prefers to rely on appropriately powered studies and solid statistical analyses to learn about the conditions under which people excel, I'm not crazy about it.",0
1925,"Interesting read. As any book written by a former journalist it is peppered with sensationalism. Whilst much of the book was interesting and readable, as a researcher I found some of his findings questionable at best. And like any good journalist he focuses on sensationalizing.",0
1926,"Interesting and thought provoking. This book was recommended to me by Amazon (thanks, BTW), and I found it an interesting and insightful read. Gladwell has clearly done his research, and follows it up with a fluid and thought provoking journey through a number of 'events' and biography's that demonstrate how the sum of the parts in a given situation or success story play a more important role than an individual incident or skill alone. Worth a read.",1
1927,Brilliant!. Absolutely Enjoyed it! Intelligent,2
1928,Please give successful people some credit. Only focusing in the environment of the successful people not their own strengths & willpower,0
1929,Four Stars. Thanks,1
1930,Paradigm Shifting. Thoroughly impressive. Gladwell writes wonderfully and highlights the perhaps unlikely backstories of people and events we write off and successful. Very readable and throughly recommended. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't benefit from this book.,2
1931,"good read. Why are some people so successful? Read the book and find out...it is amazing. practice, study, hard work and more.",1
1932,"Read like a bad doctoral dissertation. I have to preface this by saying I am a psychologist, and have taught psychology. This author's understanding of the value of both the Terman study and psychological testing is so poor, that it is clear that he only used this information to make his point. He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential. He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking. He needed to understand far more about what he was writing. I read this for a book club, and if this is their idea of important reading, then I'm going back to Danielle Steel, at least its escapist for an afternoon.",0
1933,"GREAT READ. THIS IS A THOUGHT PROVOKING BOOK FILLED WITH LOTS OF FACTS. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO READ THREW IT, AND LOVED IT!",2
1934,Four Stars. Great Read!,1
1935,excellent read very thought provoking. Gladwell outliers is a page turner. He has a knack for telling great stories. One of his many books that I would recommend.,1
1936,Amazing read would recommend to anyone. Great read. Turns the conventional wisdom upside down not just in theory but also great anecdotes..Malcolm has raised bar for himself yet again,1
1937,It's not fate. Gladwell shows how the most successful people got to the top. It shows how hard work and recognizing opportunity helped. Some of those opportunities can be manufactured.,1
1938,"Introspection. Gladwell's theories on success are interesting and definitely sparked some introspection. I enjoyed this work and my book club had a fascintating discussion about it. In fact, this book sparked multiple conversations with friends and relatives. It is definitely intriguing and inspiring.",1
1939,Five Stars. Would highly recommend this book because it really gets you thinking about life and success,2
1940,"Good book. This book provides great examples and a unique perspective on how pioneers are created. The book goes through different scenarios and shows how either hard work, luck, or a faulty system can influence the outcome.",1
1941,"I highly recommend the book to everyone. Malcolm answered a question that I always wondered about on how other people seemed lucky and appeared to have everything working for them. He had an ingenious way to tell his family story throughout this book, which made me more appreciative of reading the OUTLIERS and getting to know who is Malcolm.",1
1942,A lot of data to say nothing new. I did not like this book mainly because it seems the author collected evidence just to articulate his theory.,0
1943,Spot On. Gladwell reiterates what we know already. In such an eloquent manner! Intelligence paired with the right resources gets you to where you need to be. To be that outlier who gets the world’s attention,2
1944,"10,000 hours. Great read. Learning about the 10,000 hours is very important.",2
1945,"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected. You can also see the influences of his family in his life. His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician. Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha). Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success. Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",2
1946,Awesome. Awesome,2
1947,"Very interesting and solid points, flows nicely.. This book is very good, it brings up great points about the situations that create success. Very good social commentary and how class and different social backgrounds of individuals have to do with success. Definitely worth a read if you are on the fence about it.",1
1948,Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. This book is a really good reminder that hard work can pay dividends. Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. You don't have to be porn in the top few precent of IQ to achieve at the top of your field. Anyone in the top 25% can make it to the top with training and practice. Even the people the average person can have considerable success with training and practice.,1
1949,"Interesting Theory. I am glad that I read this book, but I did feel it was too repetitious.",0
1950,"Why are some so successful?. Malcolmn Gladwell looks into the Beatles, Bill Gates, and Mozart among other succesful individuals, who have had a very big impact in their respective fields. Why are some individuals successful like Bill Gates for example and others are not? Gladwell writes that it's a mixture of timing, opportunity, education, and chance. These individuals were born at the right time and took advantage of the right opportunities. Does this mean one's future is pretty much determined at birth? No. One must acknowledge the culture and society one has come from in order to change.",2
1951,"Must read for people suspicious of the Horatio Alger ""rags to riches"" stories. Malcolm Gladwell really hit the ball out of the park with this book. I've always been skeptical of the notion that all a person needs to do to become successful is simply ""lift oneself up by one's bootstraps"" and just do it.",2
1952,Item delivered on time and as described.. Item delivered on time and as described.,2
1953,"Wonderfully interesting book - ok so you only see it .... Wonderfully interesting book - ok so you only see it from the authors view - no critical analysis in this book, but some interesting points nevertheless",2
1954,"surprising clues about success. By looking at groups of successful people in various fields such as sports, business, legal profession, the author comes up with startling conclusions. His research can be useful for parents and young people in choosing where to focus their attention. As an older person, I can recommend it as a good read and passing it on to the younger generations.",1
1955,"Insightful, but less than fully convincing. I enjoyed Mr Gladwell's reading thoroughly. His delivery and voice are well suited to reading and I always enjoy hearing an author read their own material.",0
1956,"What Price Success?. All of Gladwell's books have been fascinating reads! This book is making me think about my own growing up years/culture/class background, and the impact on my life decisions. It makes me think about decisions I've made regarding my children, and how my husband and I bring our different life stories to bear on this. Gladwell has a way of presenting social psychology through a very engaging format. The main thesis of this book is that success is an accumulation of advantages, coupled with the ""10,000 hour rule."" The book does get to be repetitive, but is entertaining enough to make it feel worth it. I didn't alway agree with his perspective, however. An example is in presenting the KIPP schools, and the role of the extensive hours devoted to studies as a meaure of the success of the students. What bothered me about this is that it does not take into consideration the cultural context of the students, and whether this success comes at too great a cost. I would have liked to see the ""you can be successful if you put in 10,000 hours"" tempered by also raising the question of whether the ""success"" is really worth it and what such success means in terms of one's identity, value system, or other lost opportunities.",1
1957,"This book should be required reading in high school. Although the theme prevalent in this book may seem very familiar to some successful people, it is a good guide for those who think that all you need are good connections and a lot of luck. This book should be required reading in High school.",1
1958,"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book. Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",0
1959,"objective take at interpreting outliers. I loved how author's analysis was so in depth, incorporating cultural differences to its finest details. I grew up from Korea, and the section about Korean Airline and accident rate due to cultural emphasis on power differentials was truly awakening. Recommended to anyone who live in international society.",2
1960,"Outliers. A thought provoking book about what the ""recipe"" for success is. Definitely worth reading when you have small children or are planning a family.",0
1961,"Great book!. This was really fascinating and I found myself not only thinking about the ideas Mr. Gladwell brought up, but discussing them with others as well. I bought the audio book version to listen to on my drive to and from work and actually found myself looking forward to my commute each day! Great book!",2
1962,"Journalism and pseudoscience. Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",0
1963,"Smart Book. Well read. Very thought provoking. There are alot of lists in this book - which would be easier to skim in a ""real"" book - a bit tedious to hear them read outloud. But it includes lots of great stories and characters.",1
1964,Cheaper. Bought this book for son. Content are good and cheaper than book stores.,1
1965,"Binge or savour - worth reading, twice.. I suppose the King of Entrepreneurs is an outlier too:",2
1966,Only OK. I was not that impressed with this book. Nothing I read was especially profound to me. I would not recommend this book.,0

1970,This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.

1974,Great book. This book was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone.,1
1975,great. very nicely packaged. the book arrived in great condition and smelt really nice. 10/10 would buy again,2
1976,Nah.. I'm not a fan of Gladwell and this put the nail in the coffin. The hockey example is complete garbage and when you question the rest if his theories they just seem paper thin. Don't waste the money.,0
1977,"You are what you are because of where you were when.. Here is the book in one sentence: You are what you are because of where you were when, and if you worked at it 10,000 hours.",0
1978,"Friendly style and simply brilliant, buying copies for friends!. What I really love about this book is the way Malcolm Gladwell 'speaks' to the reader. I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?! An excellent read - some really persuasive stuff - great topics and theories to spark debates amongst friends and colleagues!",2
1979,"Outliers Malcolm Gladwell. Easy to read, logical and clear evidence of aspects that drive success. Whilst a lot of the things are not controllable understanding then is invaluable.",2
1980,Good. Great book to read,2
1981,"Heard it was good, found it disjointed and didn't agree with many of his conclusions. Enjoyed the first few chapters but lost all interest half way through. Seemed fairly disjointed with not much organization. I disagree with some of his conclusions, and feel he has found cases that fit his theory, but thrown out others that do not.",0
1982,Five Stars. Good book!,2
1983,"A Classic from an Original Thinker. A master of his craft, Gladwell is a genius - he looks at things so differently to us mere mortals. Surprising he has not won more accolades, but then genius is an undervalued trait in our society these days",1
1984,Enlightening. This book was an incredible read and difficult to put down. This showed me areas of life I did not think about before. There is no way someone can read this book and not get anything out of it. Malcolm Gladwell is now one of my favorite authors. I look forward to reading his other books. The best part is writing about areas that you may not find in other books. You can see the creativity of Malcolm and the passion that drove him write this.,2
1985,"Eye-opening. Few are better than Malcolm Gladwell at making us re-examine our long-held assumptions about how the world works. Gladwell examines the ""rags to riches"" myth -- among others -- and offers intriguing alternative explanations to the secrets to success. We need more people who question the status quo and look deeper into social phenomena.",1
1986,Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable. I found myself repeating much of his findings and points in everyday conversation about success. Highly recommend and am continuing to read more by him.,2
1987,"A few pearls, but not enough for a necklace. Gladwell lacks rigor (just run a google search for detailed criticism), but this book contains some interesting anecdotes (most memorably the relationship between birth dates and team selection in sports) and one important idea: focused, hard work breeds success.",0
1988,"Not Convince By His Reasoning. After many rave reviews, I expected to enjoy the book but I didn't. I thought the point that success is factored upon opportunity and having the support of influential ppl was obvious. And you don't need a scientific research to figure that out or there is a need to proof it. However, I think he forgot that opportunities can be pursued and not brought to you and that's one major factor of successful ppl. In some cases, opportunities is a greater factor while in some cases the personal drive plays a greater role. I still feel it cannot be generalized.",0
1989,"Wholeheartedly Disagree. The whole premise of this book is to convince the reader that successful people such as Bill Gates and the Beatles were more products of fortunate situations and less of their own doing, which is total whiny socialist b.s., and anecdotal at best. What about the rest of us?",0
1990,Five Stars. excellent,2
1991,"Good ! but don't believe it all.. Interesting stories and theories. Although most things said on the book are obvious, the author's message is clear. Unfortunately there is not enough research shown in the book to justify all of the author's theories.",0
1992,common sense. I was expecting to learn something insightful and new but it was all pretty much common sense. It does include interesting anecdotes and case studies.,0
1993,"Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the .... Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the success of somewhat talented, but ordinary people who were given an opportunity to excel at just the right age and at just the right time and those factors were key in creating extraordinary talent and success. This book gives surprising reasons for why intelligence, talent and or money aren't the only factors for the success of certain individuals.",2
1994,Malcolm Gladwell delivers again. I am not finished with the book but already love it! I've already heard a lot from my friends and Malcolm Gladwell didn't disappoint! I've read Malcolm Gladwell's work before and this is another good book well done!,2
1995,"Makes you really think---very good book. I really enjoyed this very interesting book. I read it and listened to it (from my library audio app) at the same time. Fascinating research on how circumstances, opportunities, family and culture affect the success of a person. Loved the chapter on the airplane pilots and their cultural differences, loved the chapters on opportunities to ""practice"" something 10,000 times....just a very readable, interesting book. I highly recommend it. Loved his ending chapter about his own family culture and how they were shaped by opportunity, etc.",2
1996,"Concepts are OK, but content and substance are weak. In general, the concepts are OK, ie part of the success of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs was because they happened to be born at the dawn of the computer age. However, beyond this statement of fact the content and substance that would support this premise is either missing or very weak. In my opinion, it was not well written.",0
1997,"very useful. I've read all Gladwell's books but I quote this one at least once a week. The concept of the 10,000 hours has become part on the American lexicon.",2
1998,Appreciate how far people grow and what got people to the top.. This book explained so much about why some people succeed and those that you thought should...didn't. The examples are fantastic and can be easily related to what one sees in their own life history.,2
1999,"Interesting concepts. I initially thought about using this book for a classroom project but found myself so engrossed in the examples, ideas and concepts. Some I agree with whole heartedly and others not so much. It made me think about my “antecedents” and actually made me connect with my Greek heritage more than I ever expected.",1

2001,Great Read!. The book is great and contains a wide plethora of interesting stories and concepts. I enjoyed reading it. It truly placed some common notions under scrutiny and challenged the assumption that high IQ equals success. This is a must-read for any Malcolm Gladwell fans or for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the world around them.,2
2002,"Informative. This is my first time reading this Author. This book was very informative about success and the true stories behind it. I liked the book very much and the thought that the author did a fair comparison of all angles of a successful persons life like, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there. The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention. This book is not only educational but also entertaining. Reading his other book now called Blink and I am almost done with it. I will say that I like this book better than I like Blink.",1
2003,7 letters. T J Oshie. Simple evidence this guy knows not what he speaks of. Born December 23. Ripping it up at hockey.,0
2004,"Unscientific. I actually liked this book quite a bit. While I liked it, overall it was rather Unscientific in its approach. There are almost no citations, so you are to take the author at his word. There are definitely some very interesting parts. The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating. The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief. Gladwell describes things as they are without sugar coating it to keep people from being offended. His theories, however unscientific at times, seem plausible nonetheless. Worth your time to read this.",1
2005,Four Stars. It a story of perseverance and being goal oriented,1
2006,"Thought provoking, yet easy to read. Having read his previous 2 books I pretty much knew what to expect from this one with respect to writing style. Gladwell's books are well written, very easy to read, and short. He lays out his thesis through a series of anecdotes, almost a set of magazine articles, which labor the point a little too long. Each anecdote is supported by data, but not to the point of overwhelming the reader, and certainly not ""comprehensive"" data on the topic.",1
2007,"Only 3012 hours to go. Malcolm's Outliers is an immersive read that draws you in and spits you out hoping that you are part of some success pattern that you haven't quite recognised yet (and wondering just how many hours you've spent doing that thing you dream of being successful at). The book provides examples of outliers who achieved phenomenal success through luck, circumstance and practical intelligence. It's an illuminating slant on the psychology of success.",2
2008,"best book i've read in a long time. The thing about Malcolm Gladwell is he makes his writing very transparent and easily readable. He could write very complicated stories and express them in an easy, understandable format. And this one, though not my favorite one of his works, creates an interesting insight in how we view the world.",1
2009,"Four Stars. Interesting and engaging, although some may be offended by his views",1
2010,Five Stars. A very interesting book really enjoyed it. Highly recommend it.,2
2011,WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,2
2012,"This is not an inspirational story if you are looking for one. Outlier is just a product of luck and effort, but mostly luck according to the author. It feels like it’s depend on your society, community and your early education. Not sure if I like this book or not. But agree that one must work hard and work smart.",0
2013,"Compelling. Gladwell is a very talented writer who has clearly put in 10,000 hours practicing his skills and has been lucky to have been given the opportunity to put those skills to use. I highly recommend this book.",1
2014,"Worth the Investment. Outliers made it to the #1 spot as a national bestseller, and it's well deserved. It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported. The book's central ideas are 1) that brain power, character, and motivation are overrated; 2) other factors—often not easily recognized or not given enough significance—such as where and when a person was born, his or her family history, and the particular twists of fate and coincidences in a life story, are integral to the success (or failure) of an individual.",1
2015,"Wow. That's a book that makes you change the way you look at the world, and how you can make your way through it successfully! Bravo",2
2016,Pretty good. nice,1
2017,"Worth Thinking About. Gladwell brings up many interesting trends and behaviors of different people and groups of people. He then uses these trends to try to justify an altruistic philosophy that will make us all better. At times, I wondered if the author was promoting outright socialism to fix out society.",0
2018,"Who knew? Data applied to our lives. Great tales of the human condition, and how rare and unusual facts contribute to our world and the people who live on this mortal coil.",1
2019,"The rich underbelly of all true success stories.. A compelling explanation, and tales of what it takes to be 'a success' fully illustrated with validated science, through engaging, entertaining, and enlightening statistics and the necessary context for understanding something most of us only think we know about. Yet, give little actual thought, or analysis.",2
2020,"""Out"" of this world. Gladwell's ideas are compelling and this is no different- Outliers shows how people aren't really born out of this world- they are given rare opportunities and work at it to make the most of those opportunities. The Beatles played 10000 hours before they made it big; Bill Gates was on the computer for his entire teen years before he made the leap to create MicroSoft; and lawyer Joe From was litigating takeovers for years before he became world-renowned for the niche attorney market. Gladwell has interesting takes on what we should do since that is the case- have staggered schooling to match birthdates; school all year round, etc. It's a good read, but there are questions- what about athletes? Does race play a factor?",1
2021,Five Stars. This is a book that should be required reading in high school. adults should read this as well.,2
2022,Solid book. Life (and success therein) is a product not only of our own hard work but also of the circumstances we are bestowed with and experiences we have throughout.,1
2023,thought provoking. What an amazingly insightful book. There is the occasional dull paragraph or maybe me being tired and therefore not concentrating! This makes you evaluate things in a different light! Highly recommend this! Almost nature versus nurture type debate.,2
2024,"Interesting but not a must read!. It's an interesting and well write book and the audio version is well done. However, it solely focused on the circumstance of what led successful people to become who they are without almost no regards to their efforts and perseverance.",1
2025,"Not great... I prefer his podcasts!. Basic concept repeated over and over again in a few brief chapters - basically your background, ethnicity and when you were born have an effect on your chances of being successfull - mind blown. I love his podcasts but this book is kind of feeble, sorry.",0
2026,Four Stars. Great book,1
2027,A new perspective to success. This book talks about successful people and how everything around them helped them get there. There were a few chapters that were stretched just to make a point. Certain chapters like the first one where the author keeps on talking about hockey players born in January was very slow and boring. but the latter ones with software entrepreneurs was very interesting. Malcolm Gladwell doesn't say anything new here except for the fact that every individual needs to work hard and practice makes perfect. The only difference here is the amount of research the author has gathered is remarkable and many of his facts and researches prove a point. The epilogue chapter was completely unrequired. I gave a 4 rating beacuse of those certain unrequired chapters. Great research and a good book to read once.,1
2028,"Outstanding, love every chapter. Hooked from day one, was not familiar with the author and now I understand why he keeps hitting home runs, every book is a best seller, cannot put it down.",2
2029,"Intrigued. I found myself highlight a lot of text and if there was one thing that was accomplished - he forced me to consider a different perspective, I was not comfortable with the ending however. I found it hard to accept as a good ending to the story. Maybe because it should have been a separate book and this wasn't the right setting for where his personal story could have gone. The ending was heavy and took the book in a totally different direction and didn't bring all of his points together .",0
2030,empowering and insightful. Fascinating book full of stuff to quote and refer too.,2
2031,Interesting read. Very interesting book. Enjoyed most of it. Especially about the sports. Other bits no so interesting to me but still readable.,1
2032,empowering and insightful. Fascinating book full of stuff to quote and refer too.,2
2033,Great book from an excellent author. I love this book it shows the mechanics of success and really gets you thinking about your own successes and how to ensure your families success in the future,2
2034,"Grossly overrated. I read the entire thing just to make sure I knew exactly how unfulfilling it truly was. There were maybe a few pages worth keeping in mind. The moral of the author's entire point is......sometimes people achieve success because of things that happened to them in life. Literally, go take the bus and have a conversation with any stranger and you'll find that to be more rewarding of an experience. I can't believe it has such an astounding reputation. I'm sorry for being harsh but there a better ways to spend your time than this reading book.",0
2035,Success is sometimes being in the right place with the right skill set.. well written with a very interesting angle. Enjoyed it.,2
2036,Great book. This book changed the way I look at things. Gladwell breaks success down into a few components:,2
2037,Great book that gives clarity into why some people are .... Great book that gives clarity into why some people are successful in life.,2
2038,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",2
2039,"Excellent book on where success comes from!. This book is written in such a manner that makes it an unbelievably easy read. It lets the reader learn the concept of what makes successful people, well, successful. It goes step by step explaining the importance of circumstance and luck (yes, luck!) as key role players in the lives of people who achieve (or don't) the kind of success that we normally attribute to just hard work and ingenuity. It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part. This also helps the reader realize that to become successful there are barriers we have to overcome beyond our own personal shortcomings, that we have to work to overcome invisible barriers imposed on us by years and centuries of traditions and culture.",2
2040,Its good.. It was recommended to me by a friend and so far am enjoying it (as an e-book). It's been a good read with a lot of anecdotal explanations about the nature of success.,1
2041,Eye opener. Really interesting at a personal level and especially if you have kids or young relatives. You can create opportunities for them.,2
2042,"Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking. Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking, giving you insight into a multitude of different factors that contribute to success that society often over looks. The book itself was in perfect condition.",2
2043,"Interesting Topic. The book is a interesting book that is entertaining, however I feel that it misses some conversation about Outliers. It does give good insight to chance, but chance only helps create an outlier.",1
2044,"Excellent. This was an excellent book, so good infancy I read it twice in succession.",2
2045,"Male centric book, some interesting thoughts. Author fails to mention the elephant in the room: the happy coincidence of being born male and how that contributes to success. There are a few studies of school children that presumably include girls and boys. Other than that, not much here for XX chromosome persons.",0
2046,"Another interesting book by Malcolm Gladwell. This book is just as interesting and filled with a lot of compelling info and data as his many other books. One person wrote a critique of his book and stye of writing as if he was supposed to be writing a scientific paper which is a ridiculous form of criticism. Of course he is an author and not a scientist (and he even writes for a magazine), but he introduces data and comparisons that are very thoght provoking and interesting to me.",2
2047,"Most interesting book I have read in a long time. While there exist a plethora of books and studies on the lives of successful people, Gladwell's treatment of the subject goes in a whole new direction that provides new insight into what makes successful people tick and how we can use that knowledge to improve people's lives. Very well-written and readable.",2
2048,Amazing book. A good book worth reading,2
2049,All hype. Not a fan of the pseudo science throughout this book. I tried to read this then listen and it just didn’t resonate with me. There are many other great books in this genre that get the message across much better.,0
2050,"Fascinating. This is such an interesting view on success, failure, circumstance and opportunity. It gives credence to the idea that there are always larger forces at work when it comes to making a name for oneself in his or her chosen field. My only real complaint is I would like to have seen more subject examples - particularly in the fine arts - with fewer pages spent on each one (Once the points are made, things get a bit repetitive). Other than that, it was really an enjoyable read, the stats alone being worth a look. It definitely tilts my world view a bit!",1
2051,"Fascinating. I loved this book. At first there appear to be lots of statistics and facts but this quickly emerges as an overall theme which underpins the development of understanding generally, the ingredients which can lead to success.",2
2052,Worth reading.. My son lived the book...an j there's ting perspective on opportuty...worth reading,1
2053,"Feel good book for egalitarians. Worried why you or your kids didn't turn out to be outliers like Bill Gates, Sidney Crosby, Shakespeare or Mozart? Fret no more, it's not your fault. It turns out, according to Gladwell's research, that success is 1% talent, 2% hard work and 97% luck. In other words (Spoiler Alert) there are no outliers.",0
2054,"Great book. Funny and interesting. To be read with caution, specially when it refers to patterns related with dates of birth. Some may believe that the fact of being born in 1955 or so would make you a billionary or a more likely to be millionaire.",1
2055,"Good Read. There are already hundreds of reviews, so I will make this very short.",1
2056,Excellent Book!. This book is very well written. Gladwell helps one to understand that there is more to success than just hard work and ability; it has a lot to do with being in the right time and place. I teach a History of Psychology class and I have adopted this book as the first to be read by my students. It lays the groundwork for the importance of history and the Zeitgeist of an era. Highly recommended.,2
2057,Four Stars. It was a gift.,1
2058,Good book. Good narrative. Quite simplistic at times but was a page turner,1
2059,"Save your money. My review sums it up for you.. I’ll make it easy...you need 10k hours plus of practice at something to be great. You also need to be born at the beginning of the year, so that your age isn’t skipped by cut off dates. Finally, no matter your income, it’s all about who you know or what is available to you that others don’t have.",0
2060,"Not a self-help book. Story jumped from random study to random study, without cohesive thought. The conclusion wise you are a product of your environment and experiences, Plus the work you put into it. Nothing really tangible that you could grab a hold of to make you a better person.definitely not a self-help book.",0
2061,"Betsy. I enjoyed the perspective that Gladwell shares, although it can be quite depressing realizing that a lot of what creates success is somewhat left up to chance. During the entire time reading this book, I kept hoping he would share secrets of how to create opportunities for oneself. Then again, that would go against the entire point of the story.",1
2062,Thought Provoking. So good I had to read it twice!!!,2
2063,"Success of Outliers Is Not About Uniqueness Alone.. For those that wonder how Bill Gates, The Beatles and Scientist Oppenheimer achieved their places in history, ""Outliers"" scraps the idea that it was due to their own uniqueness and efforts alone. It provides data that indicate, birthdates, family socio-economic group, opportunity, communication skills and 10,000 hours of practice are more likely to be the reasons. The book gave me an interesting insight into the secrets of success in the 20th Century.",1
2064,Amazing book. He develops his points in a subtle but shrewd way. Uses great examples from different areas. generally great writing as well,1
2065,Very insightful from start to finish.. Never has a book ever become so alive . We can all achieve more if we put in a little bit of effort .,2
2066,This is among the best of them. All of Gladwell's books are well worth reading. This is among the best of them. Mr. Gladwell is a good writer and writes in an interesting style. I recommend this and all of his books.,1
2067,"""The Outliers"" provides insightful analyses of the roots of success, particularly highlighting those that are not intuitively ob. This book is both theoretically interesting and also practically useful. I recommend it particularly for young people, who can relate its lessons to decisions they must make during critical years of personal development.",2
2068,wow. awesome book...well written...excellently researched...wow.,2
2069,"Good read. The book was great. It was delivered on time and come in perfect condition. Very interesting to read the little stories in it, quite eye opening. Overall I would recommend this book to others that all looking for a little something different than a regular fiction book.",1
2070,"Too many words. Malcolm has a couple of new ideas and several rehashed old ones. The concept of statistical evaluation and examination of factor confluence is important and useful, he spends too many words repeating the same information without further illumination.",1
2071,Highly recommended. So much fun to read and informative. The examples he gives are what make the book a joy to read. I actually learned a lot of good things from the book although I did not agree with everything it said.,1
2072,"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously. It is well written and very thought provoking. Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society. Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion. My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success. The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook. Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely. This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions). Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W. Bush -- does anyone think that he would have been president if not for Daddy Bush and the family and life circumstances he was born into?!",2
2073,"Provides an Ah-hah Moment. This is a great explanation about things we've often wondered about related to success. No, it doesn't just ""happen"" or does it? This book provides poignant examples of the preparation it takes to meet opportunity and the other stuff that works for us (or against us) in the pursuit of the every elusive ""success"" as defined by this culture. Gladwell gives substantive back up to his propositions, forcing the reader to give his conclusions validity and credence. Great read!",2
2074,"This book was very interesting because it explains a perspective. This book was very interesting because it explains a perspective of success that I have never thought about. All my life, I have been told that success is only achievable by intelligence and working hard in school, but Gladwell provides his own perspective. I really enjoyed the book and the life lessons it presented.",1
2075,"Gladwell presents a very compelling argument that successful people are .... Gladwell presents a very compelling argument that successful people are not always the brightest or most hard working of their generation. They are also, and maybe most importantly, men and women who were born in the right time and place. A well researched and fascinating read.",1
2076,"Excellent product. Excellent product, delivered on time Thank you",2
2077,Five Stars. Excellent arrived within 24hrs,2
2078,"Fun. Come on... It's great. Book Candy and sometimes a hoot. Sometime a ""?"""" but always Gladwell. Love it. More please!",1
2079,Informative. Good insight continents Gladwell defines success as. I hoped he would define his method or opinion about how to become an outlier.,1
2080,I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I greatly appreciate how he incorporates data and research into his logic. It gives my brain some substance to chew on. Outliers is great at pushing the reader to rethink how they evaluate success and consider what factors really effect finding it. Gladwell's writing style is very accessible and not overly academic which I also like.,1
2081,"Shoddy and Uncaring. If the author chose an attention-grabbing idea - it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert - for a magazine article, but then decided to capitalize on the popularity of his two earlier books by simply padding it out and publishing it as a book, cherry-picking anything that looked like it might support the idea, without much concern for accuracy or respect for the reader, Outliers could have been the result.",0
2082,Buy it. Great book!! Packed with awesome knowledge,2
2083,Good book. Really good read.,2
2084,good. good,2
2085,"Outliers: Finally got around to reading it. Gladwell poses some interesting observations on successful people and what contributes to their success. Basically he says practiced skills, environment and timing are the common denominators. Being born in January, I was unlucky not to be Canadian.Read the book to understand why.",1
2086,"This Changed My Outlook. There are books that make you think and then there are books that make you think and somehow along the way manage to change your entire perception. ""Outliers"" is the last of the two. When I received my syllabus for this semester I felt a tad miffed because I noticed that one author was mentioned twice as required reading. ""How can this ever help me with the emerging trends in higher education?"" I asked myself. The answer to that question remains unanswered; however, I have realized that this book can help me with my life and my own personal success.",2
2087,Book ordered. The book came in perfect condition. As it was a present for a friend I was delighted and would recommend this seller.,2
2088,"Insightful but under values one key item. I completely enjoyed listening to this book. I found it informative, interesting and thorough. It provides important details around the circumstances of the ultra successful and how they got there. It’s premise, I will admit that I have agreed with but often overlook, that no one gets far without help and support from others. The part that was eye opening for me, was how much the right timing of birth plays in being afforded opportunities that are life and even world changing.",1
2089,One of the best books I have ever read. One of the best books I have ever read. Outstanding. Everyone should read it to understand how we are pre-programmed based on our families.,2
2090,"Has promise, but fell short. When I ordered this book I thought it definitely had the potential to be an interested read - and it was. I dont disagree with the idea that some of the theories in this book could actually work, but the way the author went about proving them really threw me. As a scientist it is blatantly obvious when people are manipulating statistics. The author seemed to be cherry-picking numbers to fit his model, which is unfortunate because many of these models probably do work, he just went about showing that in the wrong way.",0
2091,Fascinating and Compelling !. The studies and examples are quite fascinating and compelling.,2
2092,"A little drawn out !. Very interesting but somewhat repetitive narrative , I suspect the message could have been delivered in a couple of chapters!!",0
2093,Good Read. New way to look at things,1
2094,Good read. Good book recommended to me,2
2095,"Outliers is Outstanding!. In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary. He proposes that 10,000 hours of practice make us outstanding; that's why The Beatles -who played on stage in Hamburg for 270 days, 8 hours a day make their special sound, or why the Hockey players born in january-febraury had more chances of make it to NHL (because they are closer to start date). Very interesting, but it could be called ""The 10,000 hours rule to be an outlier.",2
2096,nice. Nice read. Kept me engaged and offer a different perspective on great people that achieve. I defiantly reccomend this book as a good read,1
2097,Great Read. This book brings a perspective to the why and how.,2
2098,Simply a statistical abuse. Outliers is simply a statistical abuse. Gladwell may have spent years putting together a piece of odd data to support his idea. Interesting but not convincing.,0
2099,"A decent read. This book was well written with good examples and ideas. I enjoyed the way the author discussed the various cultures and their histories, giving the reader an insight into the hidden truths of success.",1
2100,Five Stars. Excellent,2
2101,Great Read. It was a great read and really had me thinking about a lot of life situations and they can either advance or hinder life opportunities.,1
2102,Practical application missing.... It was a great start. The individual stories were great but in the middle it starts dragging all the way to the end.,0
2103,"Very interesting and thought provoking book. I liked that it went behind the curtain as it were of ""success"" stories and looked at the many fascinating things that contribute to that. The stories that illustrate were particularly useful and illuminating. Or more precisely the outlier stories. As they were not all about success. A case in point being the Korean airlines bad safely record in the 90's as an outlier.",1
2104,"Entertaining regardless of its flaw. Yeah it's really a biased cherry-picked work of pop-sci writing, but it still entertaining as hell. This book is good to listen to on your commute and is short enough to be addicting, but please don't derive any life lessons from this book.",0
2105,"Interesting Read. Very thought provoking and informative. . . It makes a lot of sense and certainly debunks any thought that it only takes ""genius"" to be successful . . . It indeed is a multi-factoral phenomenum. . .",2
2106,Great book. very interesting and thought provoking book. a must read for anyone who wonders what really makes people successful. now read it!!,1
2107,Insightful. this book was an assignment for my English class.I wasn't to excited at first but as I read it really makes you think,1

2110,Inspiring and Insightful. Simply one of the best books I've read in recent memory. Gladwell makes Outliers an easy yet enjoyable and provocative read. Must buy.,2
2111,Enjoyable. Great read. Really enlightening,2
2112,"Gladwell's book is very engaging and easy to read. Gladwell's book is very engaging and easy to read. His argument is compelling, though I feel like it might be somewhat simplistic at times. Nevertheless, I think he offers a helpful counter-argument to the ""American Dream,"" a picture of success that is more realistic. His argument recognizes how greatly people are influenced by their surroundings but doesn't succumb to fatalism or pessimism.",1

2114,Another hit.. Love MG. Love his style - his soft intellectual delivery. Love his ability to draw a conclusion in simplistic terms.,2
2115,Brilliant. Very readable and full of interesting insight. Makes you think about one's own successes (and failures) in a new light.,2

2120,Don’t bother. A waste of money and time period,0
2121,Essential reading. Everyone need to read this book.,2
2122,"Absolute Must Read. I've always rejected the notion of talent. An insult to hard work I thought of it. But Gladwell has illustrated that it's not only hard work, but systemic advantages and downright coincidence coupled with hard work that creates superstars. Gladwell was extremely diligent in his research, backing his points with all sorts of statistics and lively anecdotes. What an amazing read this was!",2
2123,Four Stars. Very Informative!,1
2124,Another point of view. A great book that opens your mind up to a different way of thinking.,2
2125,a different approach to success. This is a very good book it gives a different perspective on the successful people's lives. How they succeeded in life is it only due to their ability or they were purely lucky. The author seems to have picked the examples that reiterate his idea. What about others? there are so many people who have been successful?,1
2126,Worst 7.25 hours. Skip this title - not sure why someone recommended. Boring - I’m still wondering why this is written,0
2127,"Entertaining, motivating - an easy read. I have always liked Malcolm Gladwell's books, and this book is no exception. I have recommended this book to my teenage children, and both of them have enjoyed the book. he book derives from many resources, and draws on many interesting anedotal evidences. While the anecdotes definitely make the book very easy to read and often very entertaining, they are nonetheless sometimes over-extended to 'prove' a point. Although I was very interested in the innovative rice-paddy hypothesis that Malcolm Gladwell proposes to explain the high success rate of Chinese children in Mathematics, I had a hard time to believe in this theory as the root cause. I say this, despite the fact that I was a good math student and graduated from an engineering school, and am of Chinese descent. Nonetheless, the many anecdotes used often substantiate the main theme of the book very well. However, compared to Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"", this book is more entertaining than authoritative. espite these shortcomings, I still highly recommend the book, because of its motivational value and its highly readable style and content. The theme is clear. As long as we are average or slightly above average in IQ (110 or above), what differentiates between success and failure is lots of hard work and practices, and being there at the right time and right place. By definition, nearly half of all of us possess the intellect to excel. Whether we eventually are successful depend partially on luck, but also much on our motivation and how much we want to succeed. ther than this book, I would recommend interested readers to also read Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"". njoy and succeed!",1
2128,Brilliant!. This was fascinating and thought provoking. I have been recommending it all round. A good one for those who wonder how much control we have over our destiny.,2
2129,A really interesting and thought provoking perspective on how people are perceived and get ahead.... ... well worth a read. Gripped from the first chapter in fact as a father to two kids born in Nov and Dec it really got me thinking. Want to know why? You'll have to read it yourself.,2
2130,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2
2131,"Average book.. Below par for me, it was just statistics; I don't agree with a lot of stuff.",0
2132,Broadening the perspective of what it takes to be successful.. Gladwell's takes our crude and narrow idea of what it takes to be successful and expands our field of vision.,2
2133,"Great Story- Outliers is a must read. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers- ""The Story of Success"" presents simple yet complex scenarios throughout the entire story. I read Gladwell's book during my Senior English class and I was very impressed with the way Malcolm writes. The story line all the way through the book is presented in a very creative, innovative and interesting manner. Gladwell discusses topics of what it takes to be successful, and whether or not summer vacation is a good or bad thing. Two characters that are talked about, Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer are talked about for most of the book. What make these two so interesting is their background stories. Gladwell does a great job comparing these two even though their childhoods were 100% different. The way his thoughts and information is presented are clear and neatly presented. Never once did I lose interest in what I was reading and I wanted to continue reading all the way to the end. You can see the love and passion that Gladwell has for his writing and that what made it so appealing to me and my classmates. There were though a couple things that were confusing and hard to understand. His thoughts are clear as I stated before, but they do become a little puzzling. And as a result of this there is another thing that may be of inconvenience. Some of the sections do become very lengthy and can become a tad boring. Even though the scenarios/topics are of a huge variety, some may seem targeted to only a certain group of people. For me in one instance, Gladwell was talking about summer vacation and whether it is a good thing or bad. He describes the students as the ""rich kids"" or the ""poor kids"" and some readers may find that as a little offensive. The final thing that I found confusing was Gladwell would present an idea, discuss it for some time and then move on to another and leave you wondering what happen with that topic. But in all, Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers- The Story of Success"" is exactly what the title says, successful.",1
2134,"For Your Short List of Must-Reads. This book provided for me critical, foundational background knowledge",2
2135,BEST BOOK EVER. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It assaulted interesting things with evidence supporting every idea and it makes you question the way we view certain aspects of everyday life.,2
2136,"Outliers Good, but Not Sound Research. Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers"" is an interesting read; however, the premises of the author regarding sucessful people are not based on research in the field of giftedness.",1
2137,"Uninspiring. Was hoping for more. Maybe I ruined the surprise having already noticed the""outlier"" circumstances in real life. This didn't offer anything helpful to me. Admittedly I stopped 1/3 through so maybe there were nuggets at the end. This book is often referred to and sadly not worth the read.",0
2138,Great syorytelling. I really enjoyed this book. The style of storytelling used was captivating making what would normally be a very dry subject interesting. I learned some very interesting things about success and the role of our environment in that success. I also find myself looking at successful people differently.,2
2139,"The autgot misses what his own data shows him. In my own personal experience, people that work really hard - not his pay lip service to it - are the rarest thing in our western society. While nobody denies that timing and place are critical, hard work is the difference. Leonardo Davincci conceived of the idea of a helicopter, but could not build one because he was so ahead of his time. Yet he would never have gone there except for his indomnitable spirit and hard work.",0

2142,"Extremely boring!. I love reading, and I honestly tried my best but I simply couldn't finish this book! Gladwell goes on and on and spends full chapters saying something that could have been done in a paragraph... So many pointless things... I felt such a waste of my time trying to finish the book.

2145,"Bite sized stories of success. My first Gladwell made me regret I'd waited so long to discover to discover this prolific author. His analysis of successful people was entertaining, humorous, and thoughtful. He did his best to have as global a perspective possible and to help the reader follow his train of thought. Can't wait to read more of his work!",1
2146,Good Explaination for Success. I found this book a great explanation for the factors outside of one's control that have set them up for great success but completely lacks information or credence about the things those same people did that they did control that gave them chance to take those factors and make them work in their favor.  Things we all should do to give us a chance to take the sum total influences of our own life and to direct them to our own Outlier experience. Otherwise this information is a bit depressing. Good for them but what does it do for me.,1
2147,"Four Stars. I am really enjoying reading it at the moment, very interesting. Worth buying.",1
2148,Highly recommended. An amazingly interesting book. I have so far read both The Tipping Point and What The Dog Saw by Malcolm Gladwell and cannot wait to read his others.,2

It's clearly noted the research on several topics conducted by Gladwell to write the book",2
2151,"The unfairness of success -- an unexpectedly important book. In Outliers, journalist Malcolm Gladwell examines the accidents of birth date, language, heritage and culture which give particular individuals a head-start in life -- or, equally, result in catastrophic failures. Although journalistic rather than scientific in style, Gladwell makes a wide range of compelling points which become stronger the more you think about them. This is an exceptional book and -- unlike so many of the books of this type -- really does make a significant contribution to how we view our world.",2
2152,Five Stars. This is the best book I have ever read fantastic,2

2154,"A simplistic tale on the causes of success. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is a tale about the causes of success. The book reads like a novel peppered with interesting tid-bits. The problem with many of his arguments is that they are too simplistic, often sensationalistic and unfounded. To economists or data analysts, ""Outliers"" feels like a case of literary curve fitting gone awry. Let me briefly outline point by point, how, many of the ideas of the book are simplistic.",0
2155,Great book. Great book,2
2156,"Gladwell Again Connects the Most Remote Dots to Chart the Extraordinary Success of a Chosen Few. Both a keen eye for shrewd observation and a sure grasp on historical evidence serve author Malcolm Gladwell fruitfully in this fascinating look at people who appeared at first to be ""outliers"" compared to mainstream society only to find themselves at the pinnacle of their fields through a symbiotic combination of talent, vision and intelligence. What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart. Gladwell has already proven to be masterful at identifying social phenomena that no one else has discerned quite as lucidly, such as the source of fads and cultural changes in",1
2157,"Great Food For Thought. I listened to the audiobook version of Outliers because I'd heard Gladwell read an excerpt from the book during a radio interview and I really appreciated his interpretation of his own material.<br /><br />This book is great ""food for thought"" and simply asks us to consider more profoundly how external influences do indeed play a role--often a major role--when one reaches a level of extreme success. He does a great job of proposing alternate theories for why certain individuals achieve GREAT success as compared to the old tried and true beliefs such as: ""If anyone works hard enough, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and really make something out of themselves"" or ""If you're really smart and rich, you've got it made in this world"". The book prods one to think carefully about educational systems, parenting, and other social systems in our culture.<br /><br />I didn't expect that Gladwell would provide a science-based thesis or definition of ""success"", nor did I expect a ""how-to"" manual. I found the book to be very entertaining and thought-provoking, and in that regard, my expectations were met handily.",1
2158,Inspiring call to action. I always enjoy malcolm gladwell's way of thinking. In this book he looks at what are the ingredients of success and the circumstances that lead them there.,2
2159,"Speaking of outliers.... What is it about Malcolm Gladwell's little 8.5""x5.5"" books that I find so annoying? Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",0

2163,"Not bad, but not as engaging as Blink or Tipping Point. I'm a fan of Gladwell's work, but this book did not grab me with the same intellectual hook as his prior two efforts. The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me. The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",0

2173,Surprising insights as usual with Malcom Gladwell. Those who know the writing of Malcom Gladwell and have come to expect his high standard and thought-provoking insights will not be disappointed by Outliers. Those who will be reading Gladwell for the first time should get ready for an intelligent read that will stretch steroetypical thinking about how high achievers reach their potential.

2176,"WOW – This One Will Really Make You Think. Outliers is a beautifully written work that will make you look at the world in a different way. The examples used are interesting and the way Galdwell evaluates the data unique. All in all a wonderful, thought-provoking book. Can’t wait to read the rest of his works.",2
2177,"VERY GOOD!. Dear Malcom Gladwell, our novel is a very though provoking journey through what it means to be successful. In my 12th grade senior English class we have a question that is suppose to help guide us throughout the course, that question is how does time and place define who a person is? It is, of course, obvious to see here how your novel fits in with this theme. Overall three sections resonated with me the most, Maria's Chapter, The 10,000 hour chapter and the Section about Rosetta. he chapter with Maria resonated with me very deeply because I just as Maria come from a disadvantaged home and I believe I have been through a part of what she has been through. My community is not anywhere near as ""bad"" as Maria's but my neighborhood is right up there with drug use, violence and illiteracy. I know only one neighbor of mine who has attended a University. I see everyday what can happen if one begins to lose focus of how to become successful. I do not have to work nearly as hard as Maria to become successful because my community school is more then adequate but I can defiantly see where she is coming from. he chapter about Rosetta really opened my eyes to how truly important time and place is to a person. In this chapter it becomes obvious that time and place are affecting these peoples health, in a positive way. It is impossible for a person in the 21st century to truly believe that a person can stay healthy simply because they are surrounded by people who care about them yet this is what this section proves. This section really opened my eyes to the influences that affect me everyday that I had no idea affected me everyday. he 10,000 hour chapter really drove home the importance of hard work and and determination in success. I had always thought that success came mostly from God given gifts and only slightly from hard work. I thought people like Bill Gates or The Beatles were products of luck, they could just roll out of bed and be better then anybody in the world at what they do. After reading this chapter, of course, I realized my assumptions were incorrect. Theses men were better then everyone else because they had worked longer and harder then everyone else plus they did have a little talent. Overall the book as a whole taught me that life will give you a chance to succeed you just need to be prepared when the moment presents itself and the only way to be prepared it through hard work. hank You, ick dovidio",1
2178,"Outstanding Book. Of all the many books I have read over a lifetime, this is one of the most interesting. It explains why some very talented people succeed while other equally gifted people do not. I can see the reasons for different levels of success even among my own siblings. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I have also read ""The Tipping Point"" and am now reading ""Blink"" by this same author.",2
2179,"No secret of success, but good ideas!. This is a very nice book to listen to, with many eye-openers that I feel like looking deeper into. Gladwell brushes the surface on many concepts, but connects them in a seemingly logical way.",1

But there were chapters of the book I found very hard to concentrate because it wasn't very interesting. I felt like the book started out interesting, which I liked, but then towards the middle I found myself actually dozing off when the author talked about certain topics I was uninterested in.

2191,A recommendation for Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. This book was an assigned reading for my 10th grade daughter and we read it together. It was a very interesting look at factors which play a part in phenomenal success and experiences. There is a great amount of science which backs up what is presented here and this book lays it out in a way which is interesting and accessible.,1
2192,Must Read. Great Book 10/10,2
2193,"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2

I thought there was no way it could be bad, but lo and behold, I was disappointed and bewildered by the time I got to the end of the last CD. Dumbfounded, really. It is boring, tedious, explains nothing, and gives you an overabundance of details in fields that you probably have no interest in. The main thing is that the author never quite explains the meaning, reason or route to success. The author give you the feeling that there is no rhyme or reason for anything, that it is all chance. The end is very anti-climactic I might add. You learn nothing. What a let down.",0

2200,"Unique and refreshing.. Malcolm argues that success is not achieved by extraordinary individuals that set out to achieve it out of pure desire.

Start from the top left corner of the puzzle and notice the heart shapes, they all exist in three vertical lines. Then, to its right and to its down, notice the diamond shapes in those two pictures, they too are placed in all three vertical lines, and the rest merely has two. Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C. Finally, the hearts and diamonds only occur in two vertical lines not three, therefore, the option A fits the requirements and is the answer.",2

2205,"Outliers - A MUST Read. This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous ""Stories of Success,"" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created ""Outliers"" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule) and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",1

2219,"I'm a proud West-Indian - Awesome read!. Loved everything about this book, what is there to dislike? A light skinned west-Indian born in the 50s fared much better than my darker sibling, skin color and hair texture was one of the first things you learned. Sad but true.",2
2220,audible no good. bought a book and it never played. not looking good at all. at all at,0
2221,"Understanding beyond outliers. Outliers really goes beyond explaining those that excel above everyone else, like Bill Gates and the Beatles. It also explains why some fail, such as pilots and co-pilots following cultural practices rather than safe communication techniques. And, finally it explains how all of us arrive with birth gifts from our past that influence our journey. A great read.",1
2222,"Excellent, outstanding, well written Book. This is one book that I couldn't put down. Every sentence, every chapter. Very compelling book. Mr. Gladwell really puts his heart and soul into the book and the research done on is fascinating.",2
2223,"Such a great book. It is a great book, fun to read but at the same time so eye opening, i recomend this book to everyone but mostly to young people who realy need to understand what a success is and how some one becomes an outlier",2
2224,Great read!. My son had to read this book in 7th grade for a report. My husband was helping him and read some of it to be able to help him better. He was so interested in it that my son decided to purchase it for him for a Christmas gift.,2
2225,"Brilliant. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwells 'revisionist history' podcast I decided to give outliers a go, and it didn't disappoint, I can't recommend it highly enough",2
2226,"Love the concept. Loved the concept but way, way, way too many anecdotal examples given. Good read, but skimmed a lot of the repetition.",0
2227,"Outliers. Gives an enjoyable analysis of being ""different"" from the mainstream. It took me many years before I understood being different could be a complement",1
2228,"overhyped and not very helpful. Not gonna lie, I had really high expectations for this book because it was highly recommended from all the reviews that I had read and from several friends that also told me it was very good. I was interested mainly because I thought it would be a self help/improvement book that had advice to apply to daily life, but instead I felt like each chapter was more of just providing factual stories and then having a conclusion at the end that I feel like were common sense or I already had learned through my own experiences from the past. The first few chapters were somewhat intriguing with the real life examples of successful people but then halfway through the book I already lost interest and was pretty disappointed in the content. I got pretty bored and finished the book just to finish it, not really because I wanted to.",0
2229,"Wonderful read. Great read, very insightful & educating. I really enjoyed learning about reasons for success beyond the outlier's control.",2
2230,"Right on Target. Well now I don't feel so bad that I am not Bill Gates, Sidney Crosby, or a powerful New York attorney. So much depends on chance and being in the right place at the right time. There is still hope.",2
2231,Interesting read.. Great read that keeps you completely engaged.,2
2232,"Luck or circumstances. Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.",1
2233,"Informative, but overall kind of common sense.. I rated it 4 stars becauseit was well written and obviously thoroughly researched. The overall message, however is not that esoteric or secret.",1
2234,Another great book from Gladwell. A very insightful book and very pleased it's narrated by the man himself - Malcolm Gladwell,1
2235,Interesting fast read. The author strings together some very interesting facts and figures that seem to support his theory of what makes people successful.,0
2236,An Analytical view on success. Data driven view on how people succeed,2
2237,"Interesting but pointless information. I have enjoyed MG’s books before but I fail to take away any real and meaningful value from this text. Outliers discusses why some are famous, wealthy, expert etc. First you’re led to believe the infamous 10,000 hours is all you need but then you realize the real controls on your success are out of your control.",0
2238,"The Keys to Success aren't what you think they are. Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com",2

2240,The secret of success. This book is telling the secret about success,1
2241,Great book. This is a very interesting book who make you realise a lot of think about the way we are raising our kids.,2
2242,Five Stars. Best gift for any age person that’s looking to be successful in life and business,2
2243,"Inspiration for those who appear to be out of step.. Gladwell is always a great read. His ability to take diverse stories and weave them into a form that supports his thesis is wonderful. Good stories, good premise. Thanks Malcolm.",1
2244,"Facts, poignant personal history. The book has Gladwell's usual mix of facts and insights, which shed great light even if not always 100% justified by the facts. For example, he points out the impact of general birth period on 19th and 20th-century plutocrats, and on 20th century Jewish lawyers bucking the WASP establishment, and the impact of birth MONTH on Canadian hockey stars. He's strong on showing unexpected correlations, but sometimes gets utopian on ways to fix the resulting inequities. His last chapter is a poignant essay about his Jamaican mother's mixed ethnic background, and all the little coincidences that give us the backgrounds we have.",1
2245,It wakes me up.. This book gives me a chance to expand my viewpoint and translate the facts from various kinds of perspectives eventually enables me to get a bird eye over things.,1
2246,Great Book. I had to have this for my ROTC class in college and I honestly would have read it outside of the class.,2
2247,Personality I like how the author focused on more than one person .... Book Review for Outliers,1
2248,"A Self-Help Book You Can't Pass Up!. Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is. Reading this book will give you an entirely different outlook on not only the world around you but also our worlds history and how today has come to be. This book is a #1 national bestseller for a reason and you will not regret making the decision to read it!",2
2249,"Time, Place, Skill, & Opportunity. Great read! It shared stuff I've not thought about before. What I've taken away from the book is to build a strong skill / set of skills and look for opportunities.",2
2250,"A mentor lent me this book, I really enjoyed it.. Had to get a copy for myself.",1
2251,I quote it. I've quoted it more than once in everyday conversation. I'd say that's a win for the author. It also helped me convince my skeptical husband to hold our son back a year in school. He was born in August.,2
2252,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed. The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair. Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November. It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year. Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children. They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year. However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year. As the school years pass, the gap widens. A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform. Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",1
2253,Great book. This is a great book for anyone that interested in weird facts and outcomes of people becoming successful by applying statistics and just dumb luck of being born in the right place at the right time. Very interesting and you can read and come back to it at each chapter without having to re-read or try and remember anything and very simple and easy reading. No complicated psychology…..,2
2254,Paper back. Very interesting book !,2
2255,"Who Knew?!. This a great book! If you ever wanted a working theory on how to be successful, or how those you admired became successful, this is the book to read. Very thought provoking, convincing, creative and entertaining!",1
2256,"Interesting. I liked the fun facts and correlations presented. I'm not sure how you really wrap a book like that up, so the ending was weird. If it wasn't for his exit interview and the all encompassing title the irony at the end would of been lost. I would recommend to someone else.",1
2257,Three Stars. First half of book much better that the disappointing second half.,0
2258,"Average book. It's not average in terms of other books, but I've read much better from Gladwell. Would recommend nonetheless based on merit of ideas",0
2259,"Nice explanations on societal norms. The book is easy to read and provide interesting insights. Although most of the writings are purely observations and co-related anecdotes, it is engaging and worth the time.",1
2260,Nice book overall. Good read.. This is a good book. Most of the chapters were interesting. I found that the last few chapters were a bit boring but overall overall this is a good read.,1
2261,It was “eh”. I could sum up this book with “work hard and put a lot of time in and hope luck is on your side”. It’s not a great listen. I’ve heard it’s a better read but I honestly don’t think I would’ve made it through had I tried to read it. I knew it was gonna be rough when the opening of the book starts with a 20 minute diatribe on hockey players birthdays.,0
2262,"Curious as why past or current events have occured?. Proposes several observations and how these observations are to be evaluated. In short, have you wondered ""why"" as to a pass or current event? This book provides material that may assist in answering your question. AND, may be of value going forward.",2
2263,"Excellent perspective view on success achieving. Great analysis of evident cause of success that is clouded by notion of genius in our time. Lots of kids who think they are geniuses may benefit from this book, come down from their cloud based thoughts and start working hard on building their seed of genius into actual success. We'll summed up notion that hard meaningful work pays back for everyone who does it.",1
2264,Fascinating. I give this book 5 out of 5. It was riveting from start to finish and made me look at this idea of success from a totally different perspective. The stories are emotional and compelling. I want to read it again and again.,2
2265,"interesting, I liked it. this book presents examples of well known success stories with a deeper dive into the circumstances that aligned feeding the inevitable achievements, iconic behaviors that made the best of the best known throughout the modern world.",1
2266,"A must read, how to understand failure and success conditions.. I always recommend this book.",2
2267,"Love it, Love it, Love it. The beauty of a gift. Thanks for being a gift Malcom. The work that was necessary to compile this i would guess is a lot. Thanks for doing it and making it available.",2
2268,Wow thats why people are succesful.. Was guided to this book by one of my sons rugby coaches. Well worth the read. Even if you haven't got a son/daughter who is talented and are getting frustrated by their lack of application this book is worth reading. Ever wondered why people are succesful well here is the answer.,2
2269,"Smooth and insightful reading. Smoothly written (as Gladwell does), insightful and fun.",1
2270,Interesting. Interesting and easy read. Very informative and puts a lot of perspective on some success stories but it generalizes and zones in on specific success stories.,0
2271,"Not worth it. The main point of this book is that successful people aren't successful just because of their efforts but also because they got lucky in some ways, for instance Bill Gates was lucky enough to have been a young curious man with access to a computer in a time when it was very hard to get access to a computer.",0
2272,Excellent book.. I learned a great deal from reading this book. I teach business and economics at the university level. I will definitely use some of the material in this book in my freshman university lectures.,1
2273,"nurture over nature. basically, ""you didn't build that"" is the message. While I agree with much of what he says, we can't ignore the hard work these people put into being the best. What good would this good fortune and opportunity be if one didn't seize it?",0
2274,"Great book. I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It has so many questions to make you think about in this life. And guess what, the answers are in there, and I guarantee you that all the theories sound very reasonable. They might not be 100% correct, but his theories cannot be neglected.",2
2275,"Changes my view of the world. Very interesting. Changes my view of the world, ""successful"" people and my future. Highly recommended for those that are curious about the world around them.",1
2276,"Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right. I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",1
2277,"What's the big deal?. This is the second Malcolm Gladwell book I have listened to. I'm glad that I looked at some of the other reviews before I finished, rated and reviewed Outliers. I listened to Talking to Strangers first, and my initial impression was, What was that about? One gets a general notion of what Gladwell is trying to say in both books. However,if it were not for the title of the books, there would probably be a lot of head scratching in Gladwell's audience.",0
2278,"School making me read. This book is ok, but i hate it when were forced to read something. Id rather read something more intresting",1
2279,"Good content, too preachy. Great takeaways and at least Gladwell doesn't pretend that he is molding his investigation and reporting of facts to fit his predefined narrative.",1
2280,An easy read. Really enjoyed this book,2
2281,"Not entirely new Idea but pleasure to read.. Like other bestsellers Blink and Tipping point, Malcom Gladwell has written compelling stories. He has tried to find out what makes people successful. This book is not about how to be successful, but tells about how opportunities and legacy play role in life of successful people. This book is more about the circumstances where one has little control over and how these circumstances affect us, Except 10,000 hour rules, which explains how hard work and persistence is more important than intelligence and innate talent.",1
2282,Fascinating. Excellent read would recommend reading it through twice. Now annoyed that my parents didn't have me earlier in the decade and later in the year,1
2283,Read the first few chapters. The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell,0
2284,"Very Good. Amazing look into what it takes to be successful. Malcolm Gladwell takes you on a fascinating journey into the makings of some of the greatest minds, and bodies in history.",1
2285,"messed up a bit. the book itself is fine, however it looks a bit used. definitely was not in new condition, had markings/discoloration/tears. all minor issues for a book I suppose, but this was supposed to be a gift.",0
2286,Five Stars. excellent with 5stars,2
2287,"Arrived fast, amazing book. Very good book have bought it multiple times and recommended to multiple friends",2
2288,Amazing Book. This is an amazing book full of wisdom and insight. Plenty of thought provoking knowledge.,2
2289,"Pop Culture Outsights. Likes to engage is data mining approach to make his arguments, and just wanted to espouse his view on how interactions with the environment and cultures should work. Talent is talent and his view is so what - more effort will get near equivalent result. Bunk, my becoming the next MJ isn't happening. Devoted a significant portion of his work to promoting year-around school, and avoided the obvious problem with underachievers - the lack of parental ability and responsibility for upbringing and any thoughts on how to address this issue.",0
2290,Interesting Subject Matter. Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of explaining his thesis that the outliers we see and idolize worked hard for their success but would not have achieved any notoriety in their field had it not been for some incredible timing and cultural background that come into play.,1
2291,"Leftism supported by cherry-picked data and bias. Gladwell's central theme is the notion of the correlation between diligence, hard work and success is mistaken. He uses various examples of elite success and attributes the outcome to competative or situational advantages. He however dismisses the fact that in every example both advantage and personal perserverance, hard work and above average work ethic are clearly present. Gladwell would have done a better job to conclude that his outliers are borne of both advantage and excellence combined rather than allow personal bias to blind himself to half of his own book.",0
2292,Very interesting. Some great stories of success and the hidden factors behind what makes people extraordinary,2
2293,"Worth a read. Malcolm Gladwell has a storytelling style that makes for compelling reading, albeit based around 'one big idea', in this instance 'grit'.",1
2294,Four Stars. A must read especially for young adults.,1
2295,Exceeding my expectations.. Topic is fascinating. I've known about the book from my brother going back around 16 yrs ago.,2
2296,Four Stars. Good!,1
2297,"Great read that reviews a lot of Outliers and how they became such.. This was a fantastic read. It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing. Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing. Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.",1
2298,a great read.. Gladwell really put success into perspective. He looks at the whole picture rather than the cliff notes version. He teaches the value of hardwork and the result of ceasing an opportunity. I really enjoyed this listen.,1
2299,Great work stays focused on the data not conventional wisdom. Great work original thinking that inspired susequent books such as matthew syeds black box thinking...,2
2300,"What Makes Success? A Little Blt of a Lot of Things. (A teacher's review). In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell seeks to disabuse us of the notion that genius and greatness are predominantly a function of innate ability and IQ. He rightly notes that while IQ is certainly a contributor, it reaches a ""point of diminishing returns"" after a while: once people score about 130, IQ becomes less important and ""intangibles"" (my term) become more important.",1
2301,"Another hit by Malcom G. Another great read from Gladwell. If you like the podcast you’ll like the book, guaranteed.",2
2302,"Worth the Investment. Outliers made it to the #1 spot as a national bestseller, and it's well deserved. It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported. The book's central ideas are 1) that brain power, character, and motivation are overrated; 2) other factors—often not easily recognized or not given enough significance—such as where and when a person was born, his or her family history, and the particular twists of fate and coincidences in a life story, are integral to the success (or failure) of an individual.",1
2303,"An Intriguing Read..... This book covers intersting social factors that may determine successful individuals. The author makes you think about culture, educational achievement, and hard work in a new way. As it is an entertaining read, the applied economic theories are a bit stretched. Overall, I would recommend Outliers but, follow it up with a book written by a true economist.",1
2304,"Great Book!. As a millennial, the principles laid out in this book shaped how I see the professional world and how mentors in my life gave guidance. Growing up, the term “ten thousand hours” became a cliche when talking about reaching the apogee of a certain field. After listening to this book, I understand the nuance and true meaning behind that statement: simply working hard for 10,000 hours doesn’t get you to the pinnacle of your profession; rather, unique opportunities propel you to unprecedented heights when combined with 10,000 hours of determined effort. Still work hard. I listened to the whole book in less than 24 hours because of quarantine. I highly recommend this book. While it’s his most famous work, it’s not his best, but it’s still very interesting.",1
2305,"Best read.... You get to know what makes people successful. And how a little proportion of timing (of you may call luck) plays a critical role in their lives.. all but without belittling their skills, efforts and hard work.. best read..",2
2306,I should have read this years ago. Well written and the bulk of the points are worth considering. I should have read this book when I was was starting out on a career,2
2307,Good. Good product,2
2308,For all self-made Successes. Hard work and perseverance bear fruit but don’t fool yourself into thinking that its enough and that it entitles you to scorn those at a lower level. We have a lot to learn......,2
2309,"Wonderful interesting quick read. Outliers is filled with interesting facts and figures. This book will keep you reading long after you thought you would stop for the day. You don't often hear the word ""fun"" associated with a book but this was fun to read.",2
2310,"Good read, but does not challenge the foundations. Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.",0
2311,"Gladwell delivers yet another thought provoking read. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell argues that there is no secret to success. There are key ingredients, he says, such as being in the right place at the right time, receiving extra tutoring/training, and additional opportunities. Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc? In summary, there are no short cuts to success and very few successful people who have not put in their 10,000 hours of practice. Now, stop reading this review and get practicing!",2
2312,"Intriguing. One of the best books I've listened to in a while. If you've got a curious mind, you'll be intrigued by the book and its ideas.",1
2313,One of my new favorite books!!. Wow! This book has given me an entirely different perspective to examine my own life and how to consider the opportunities that have helped me in life. The stories of success that Gladwell presents are applicable to all.,2
2314,"Five Stars. excellent writing to expand your views, thoughts....ideas....",2
2315,Product Off. The product showed up with the first page ripped and the text being crooked in the book. Very unimpressed,0
2316,"000 hours and become perfect.. Mr gladwell does it again. Such an incredible read. I need to find my niche where I get my 10,000 hours and become perfect.",2
2317,"Nothing that Profound. I read Blink and Tipping Point and Outliers is a lot more watered down. A lot of what Gladwell says is common sense. And yes he does site some interesting studies and makes some interesting points, the book wasn't consistent. Not all the topics really fit the theme of the book so half the time I was wondering why or how the chapter was even relevant.",0
2318,"that allowed me to enjoy it so much. I didn't exactly have any expectation, aside from the fact it's popular, when I picked it up and, probably, that allowed me to enjoy it so much. However, I have seen various arguments made in the book elsewhere before I read the book. Nonetheless, Malcolm did a far better job than the other sources through his qualified delivery and interesting real world examples.",2
2319,Five Stars. Great book which am using as part of my studies. Quick delivery!,2
2320,Amazing!. This book really opens your eyes to everything that truly goes into someone becoming extremely successful. It is very intriguing and entertaining.,2
2321,"Intriguing. Gladwell writes convincingly and raises some intriguing ideas for discussion. We had a great time going through the rosters of most NHL teams to test his birthdate theory. While he veers slightly off topic in the last portion of the book, overall the examples he chooses to dissect are engaging and worth considering. A fun read!",1
2322,"Interesting book. Very interesting perspective on success factors found among successful people. You will be thinking about what he says, especially if you have young children that you would like to be a step ahead ofk the rest...",2
2323,Came fast and in great condition.. Nothing bad to say. The book came fast and in such a great condition for the price.,2
2324,Five Stars. Quality book,2
2325,"Bringing light to what ought to be obvious but isn't. Interesting, thought provoking and easy to read but also feels a little facile.",1
2326,Five Stars. One of my faves!,2
2327,Really interesting book about how luck & hard work plays a key part in success. I found that I couldn't put this book down.,2
2328,A Think Piece. love love LOVE Malcolm Gladwell,1
2329,Change How You View Success. This book questions the common belief that success is entirely individual. Anyone who has wondered what makes a person successful or has felt intimidated by the seemingly self-made nature of outliers would enjoy this book.,1
2330,Amazing Book. one of the best books i had,2
2331,"Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am .... Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am certainly thinking a lot more now, and appreciate his perspectives. ""Freakonomics"" for real life......",2
2332,Buy it read it. Class read,2
2333,"Good but wrong about science. Gladwell writes an interesting book here and he is certainly brings forth many interesting stories and examples of environmental influences on kid's outcomes. I think he overplays his hand a bit and ignores much of what biological science say about theses things. For example Asian kids being better at math, well they are still better at math even when they are raised in or adopted into another culture or country. Maybe rice farming did make them better at math, but this characteristic goes beyond mere culture because you can remove culture and it still remains. The same goes for much of the other topics in the book. There's a bit of liberal fantasy about the whole thing, like Gladwell wishes the world were a certain way and then just starts pretending it is as he wishes, regardless of contrary evidence.",0
2334,"I feel sorry for Gladwell. This is the first ever negative review I am writing on the internet. I dont like to criticize but man, I can't help it.",0
2335,Five Stars. Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors! His writing is spectacular.,2
2336,"Confirmed my theory, insightful examples along with a personal story. This book was really interesting. There were so many different stories throughout the whole book. References to Rice Paddies, the smartest man in the world (IQ wise), Bill Gates, and the author's own story (to name a few). I though the author did a nice job of reference studies/research done in conjunction with these stories - not to mention the information is provided if you want to go read the research yourself.",2
2337,"Perfect. Perfect……But I just started reading, why do you force me to write a comment? My friend recommend this book for me, and it seems it's an interesting book with very different views.",2
2338,Well written and thought provoking.. Interesting read. Some of the points made are common sense but this books makes a good analysis of what successful people have in common. Definitely worth the time.,1
2339,"Not great... I prefer his podcasts!. Basic concept repeated over and over again in a few brief chapters - basically your background, ethnicity and when you were born have an effect on your chances of being successfull - mind blown. I love his podcasts but this book is kind of feeble, sorry.",0
2340,"Good, easy read. I enjoyed it and found it very interesting because it's just nothing I've ever heard before, or told in that way. The stories were a bit long winded but the material is amazing.",1
2341,"Interesting stories. Its light on statistics but full of interesting stories and data on people, like Bill Gates, who are considered ""Outliers.""",1
2342,"This book is fantastic. I am a big fan of business literature and have read books by authors such as Jim Collins, Dale Carnegie and more.",2
2343,Five Stars. Just as described!,2
2344,Five Stars. Great read,2
2345,Five Stars. It' a good book,2
2346,👍. 👍,2
2347,More fascinating facts from m More fascinating facts frm Malcolm. As interesting as Freakonomics but with more recognizable characters,1
2348,Changing your perspective. Really enjoyed the format and approach. Some great stories to challenge how we think and approach success.,1
2349,"Great read. I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it for one of my criminal justice classes for assignments, however it didn't feel like a drag to read. I enjoyed reading it although at times it did get wordy. But I would honestly recommend this book.",1
2350,"Excellent. The book is easy to understand, explains key points with examples and gets to the point quickly. Very interesting and I look forward to reading more of his work.",2
2351,Gives other explanations why some are successful while others are not.. Purchased this book a couple of months ago as a new supervisor. Outliers met my expectations by explaining why some folks are successful while others are not.,1
2352,"Worthwhile Read!. Malcolm Gladwell is such a phenomenal thinker and writer! I bought this book, along with Start with Why, for my 16 year old nephew who is pondering his place in the world. These two books, along with Malcolm Gladwell's other work has personally helped me gain a better understanding of myself and others, and has helped me change how I live my life. Buy the book!",2
2353,"Insightful and interesting. What I enjoyed about this book is it's  straightforward and brings facts to the table, whilst explaining how the stories mentioned contributed to success.",1
2354,"Easy to read support for the truth that no one succeeds alone.. The author is easy to read. He divides the book into groups of factually similar individual stories that, in turn, cluster around a common theme. Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone. In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there. The book is an understated argument that raw talent is distributed evenly and that society would benefit if the opportunity for development was equally distributed.",2
2355,A new perspective. This book offers a new perspective to success. Definitely a one time read not only to understand success but the real life incidents and research is impressive,1
2356,Another solid book by Gladwell. Gladwell is an amazing writer. I wish he'd publish something every six months.,2
2357,buy at your own risk. it was a good read. I wouldn't really recommend it to a friend. you will definitely learn a new way to look at success though and how it's obtained. it's not just all about being the best at something it's also about having an opportunity to become the best at something,1
2358,Four Stars. Great condition!,1
2359,overstuffed to deliver one message. outliers aren't really outliers. they arre lucky . that's the gist of the book.,1
2360,"Very engaging. I had read Bounce (Outliers came first) and much of the same studies are repeated in this book so I skipped a lot. But if you haven't, it's a good read and really makes you think about the nature of success and talent. It would be an interesting one for a book club as it offers much to debate such as about nature/nurture, social mobility and how advantageous our beginnings are.",1
2361,"This is listed on the business books list but captured me like a thriller. Once I started this one, I could not put it down. I had already read ""10,000 Hours"", which this builds on. This does a fabulous job of showing how some of our most famous cultural icons, like Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, and the Beatles, succeeded to the level of great fame and fortune not just through individual effort. Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan). There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important. Fascinating!",2
2362,"Great book that takes excuses away.. I found Outliers to be a highly enjoyable read. Its a book you read and find yourself telling others about. It debunks the convient myth that people we look at as successful or just born with it. That thinking lets some people feel comfortable with not being as successful as they could be. The bottomline is the book shows you why Bill Gates and a few other successful people are in effect successful. It was because of their life experiences, luck, and taking advantage of the opportunities given them. Also, you will find the year and time of year you are born can make a big difference; I am not talking about horoscope stuff eitehr, haha.",2
2363,"Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes. This book is full of interesting stuff: From why one rural community in the US had amazing health to how plane crashes happen. It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance. (Try also reading Mindset by Carol Dweck.)",2
2364,"I liked the concept of the 10. I liked the concept of the 10,000 hours rule however I didn't really like how the author linked China's success to rice farming, it seems like retrofitting.",0
2365,"Pretty good. I bought this as a present for a friend who has an interest in sociology, but is not studying it.",1
2366,"Not a big fan.. This book makes the case that success comes from your background more than anything. Luck plays a bigger role than anything? So if you don't consider yourself a success, just give up and blame society and your ancestors. He doesn't down play the hard work but...",0
2367,"Interesting. Yep. I enjoyed the book and thought it was a good listen. I was expecting some new information, not more of the same ""successful people are successful because of their circumstances in life."" I was hoping to learn something about what sets outliers apart from other people who were born into similar circumstances and never become successful. It didn't serve the purpose that I was hoping it would.",1
2368,"Outliers has some interesting concepts and is certainly thought provoking, but after a few chapters you 'get the idea' and can lose interest.. Outliers has some interesting ideas and concepts, but some of the charts and research get a bit redundant. Once you sort of 'get' where the author is going, it is difficult to continue to read. I enjoyed some of the ideas and this book did stimulate some good discussion among my friends who also read the book. I would have preferred to wait for a paperback and not bought this in hard cover. Some of the chapters seemed almost 'added on' to lengthen the book once the idea was presented.",0
2369,"Awesome!. I didn't follow the chapter about the Jewish lawyers too well, and as such it was a little dry for me, but not too bad. Other than that I absolutely loved it!",1
2370,Great!. good quality! perfectly works!,2

One of the best non fiction books I've read this year, as all Gladwell interesting discoveries and insights can be put into practice and change how we see what the vast majority takes for granted or fails to pay much attention to, missing the point.",2
2373,Nice. Interesting book,1
2374,"Outliers. Great book I've gotta say. If you're looking to nerd out on how successful people get to where they are this is for you. From Bill Gates to pilots to seemingly everything the author has boiled success down to a science and uses seemingly odd details such as birthplace, month of birth, and ancestral background to explain a persons potential for success and how under the right circumstances these favored persons become the greats that we dream of becoming. Very informative.",2

2382,Very good. Changes your perspective on greatness and makes you realise just how fortunate you are to be where you are now,1
2383,Good and a quick read.. A friend recommended this title. Im glad he did. The way the stats are presented is unique and appreciated.,1
2384,"A book that makes you rethink how your past and culture may affect you and how to act upon it. I liked about the book that it makes clear that great success stories involve a lot of factors and people, that one may overcome (or be blocked) their cultural and family barriers. A book for a self-improvement process that not everyone is ever ready to start.",1

2387,Very interesting book. Very interesting book. A good read!,1
2388,"Perspective changes. This book starts out kind of slow with basic definitions and examples of outliers. Being a statistics guy, I found this redundant. However, the author strategically does this to build the plot and the theme behind the entire book. The way we analyze outliers and success stories in general, is completely flawed. Gladwell provides numerous examples as to why our mindset is flawed and backs it up with irrefutable research from different fields. If you're a hard worker but feel like you just can't seem to find a break, then this book is for you. Not only will it motivate you but it will refuel your persistence in the goal of ultimately achieving success.",2

But the conclusions he comes to make huge assumptions and ignore the facts that don't fit his views. It was a very frustrating listen, like arguing with someone making terrible points but not being able to respond.",0
2393,"Highly Recommended (letter to author). ""Outliers"" has directly related to my essential question for my senior English course. In my class our essential question is ""To what extent do time and place define a person"". The purpose of our essential question is for us to take a close look on the things around us and realize the importance of time and place. In your book this question is answered in almost every chapter. In the epilogue you tell us about the story of your mother and how she became successful. The events in her life directly related to our question because without the men and women who influenced the scholarships for Jamaican children in that time period you mother might have not been able to attend college. The epilogue for me was one of the best chapters because of the way the story was told and how well the chapter was structured to explain every facture that influenced and defined how your mother came to be successful. I also believe that chapter 6 on Harlan, Kentucky was a very intriguing chapter. The information in the chapter made me look at cultures within the United States differently, in a more understanding way. Also it made me realize that many of my southern relatives had the culture of honor. Also I found the 10,000 hours chapter a fascinating chapter. I liked how you showed many different successful people in totally different occupations, and how those people were living examples of the 10,000 hour rule. One of my favorite parts in that chapter was when you went into detail about the Beatles success story. I enjoyed this because the music industry now days it doesn't required a lot of practice to get acknowledged, but to do what the Beatles did takes an overwhelming amount of talent and I personally wish that many of the other artist out there would learn from the Beatles story and see that hard work and practice pays of rather than using technology to improve your music. Overall Mr. Gladwell I just would like to say that this book is amazing book and that it is one of my favorites. Each page of the book kept me attentive and made me want to continue reading to absorb more and more information about the people around us. Thank you very much for writing this book Mr. Gladwell.",1

2398,A really interesting read. An insightful book that makes you think. It's not a guide for life but it is interesting as a parent to give you more motivation to look for and use all opportunities that come along in life for your child. It's an easy read - not too heavy but definitely thought-provoking.,2
2399,Fantastic read!. The book helps the reader to understand why some seem to do better than others. I found it very informative and educational.,2
2400,"Flawed science. Bad science heaped upon a completely unsubstantiated premise! Malcolm ASSUMED that the reason the people in a village lived so long was because of their social structure. I repeat ASSUMED! He then goes on to turn this into FACT basing the remainder of the book on this assumption. Sounds like either side of global warming. Or, perhaps, both sides simultaneously!",0

2403,My first Gladwell!. The research done for Outliers was very thorough and allows one to think differently about success.,2

We were supposed supposed to study the way that Malcolm Gladwell writes since he is very successful in his style.I think he is an entertaining writer and this was a good read but I don't buy everything he's selling in it. I've read his other books as well and feel the same way about them. I'd probably like them a bit more if there were just a tiny bit ""more academic"".",1
2407,"Bas van de Haterd. Absolutely brilliant. Gladwell, in his own way, describes that succes doesn't come to anyone just like that. He takes very far fetched examples and makes it clear cut that it all seems to be connected. And it is. The implications on what he writes however go further then what he defines. If you open your mind to it, it seems there is so much we never thought about out there.",2
2408,"Exceptionally mind-blowing and eye-opening. If you are seeking answers to many of life's great concerns and how they have affected you, how they have made you who you are, then this book is for you.

2410,"Good but not great. Good read, builds his case very well on how we are a product of legacy and community rather than only our choices but does not tackle how to use that for one's benefit. While it's enjoyable to read, it does not change you in any way!",0
2411,"Solid Gladwell. What separates star athletes, scientists and entrepreneurs from the rest of us? What sort of stuff are self made millionaires made of? Malcolm Gladwell tackles the stereotype of the independently successful in his book Outliers. From rags to riches, or riches to rags, each of us are profoundly influenced by our environment. Gladwell argues that there is no such thing as the self made man and that your future is more inherited than earned. His focus is on environmental factors such as date of birth, geography and family heritage. Want to know the best month to be born to become a famous NHL hockey player? What about the right year to become a technology mogul? Gladwell highlights a series of markers that will exert the greatest amount of influence over ones future successes or failures.",1

2416,Interesting Nonfiction. The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life. It reads almost like a fiction book. The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened. He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,1

2420,"Are There True Outliers?. Who would have ever thought that the Beatles, star athletes, and Bill Gates would have something in common? Most would think all they have in common is what meets the eye: their wealth. No, it's the fact that they are all outliers. In the book Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, Gladwell challenges their ""success"" by asking why was it so easy for these individuals? Gladwell uses data and facts that the ""average Joe"" can understand. Gladwell shows that the road to success isn't just determination and talent; it's also opportunities and social class. Gladwell shows that some successful people aren't just outliers; they are given advantages by circumstance, social class, and culture that you and I may not have. ladwell has a smooth writing style that is easily read. If you wanted a fluid, quick, and interesting book, I would recommend Outliers. It was fun to read and made me question if I was given these rare circumstances, who the person I could be if I was given all of the opportunities the ""outliers"" received. Outliers in a motivational and uplifting book about ordinary people who, given extraordinary circumstances, made the best out of it. Any book that has a good message like that gets a ""thumbs up"" from me. Gladwell uses a lot of charts, tables and other eye catching graphic items in his book to keep the reader not only entertained, but also to demonstrate that he is not just making up his data about the outliers. I really enjoyed how different outliers were discussed in same chapter to show their similarities. Gladwell also does a good job researching his topics including quotes from outliers and subject experts on the given subjects and people. He keeps an upbeat tone throughout the book and always proves his point thoroughly. ut with by proving his point so thoroughly, sometimes I was bored with all of the facts. While the book wouldn't be the same without all the facts, sometimes the point was overstated and redundant. Some may like the thoughtful thoroughness of the writing but I believed him and was in awe of the facts in short order. I would have liked to see how an average person could actually become lucky, a true outlier; but this of course would contradict the book. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to see someone who truly ""earned their stripes."" utliers is a book for anyone who has ever wondered why some excel while others just fit into the norm. It is a captivating book for anyone who wants to read about an engaging topic that gets into the heads of the world's elite members. The book is a book of success, and good fortune, for those who receive it. Outliers reminds us all to be all that we can be because we have been given certain circumstances or, as Gladwell states from the Matthew Effect, ""opportunities that lead to further success"" If you like an upbeat informative read the keeps you yearning for more, I would hands down recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.",1

2425,"Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.. Outliers is a book about successors. Malcolm Gladwell analyzes success follows a predictable course. Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",2

2428,"Pretty interesting, but lacks actionable advice.. A fun read with i intriguing insights about successful people. I was hoping for advice on becoming, or nurturing traits of outliers in employees, children, or ourselves.

This book was required reading for my high schooler this past Summer Break (but I got to it first). Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here. The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting. Convincing, great food for thought. The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time. I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages. (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.) For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research. This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education. The insights this book will provide them should serve them for a lifetime. The insights I gained, some of which were hypotheses previously, will serve to provide more understanding of what possibly may be going on under and around me during my lifetime.",2

2436,"Great subject. Powerful examples.. Very good subject, I am fully aligned with the core assertion that all of us are primarily result of circumstances and opportunities we get in life, but the author's treatment of this assertion neglects to highlight a core idea, that making the most of an opportunity is the responsibility of an individual. Talented or not, one must have the ability to persevere in order to succeed. Making relevant personal choices in a timely manner and being willing to pay the price for reaching a goal is as central to the idea of success as opportunity is. Foresight and conviction, open-mindedness and intrinsic drive, optimism and patience are all such traits that make a successful individual. Nature of an individual who just doesn't give a damn will always overpower the nurturing received from a caring set of parents or community that believes in them and wishes to invest in them. We can't just claim that an older sibling ends up more successful because they received the undivided attention of parents. That by definition would make older siblings more successful in a statistically significant way. However, that's not what we see. Even innate talent is useful for a person who doesn't show the aforementioned traits and an attitude for self-correction and life long learning.",1

2441,Very informative. One should reafirma this book because hidden within are one principle to personal and one principal to multi generational success and advancement.,1
2442,"""Success"" seen in a new light. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, various stories of individuals who achieved success in several different ways are highlighted. In the ""10,000 hours"" chapter, Gladwell expresses the mantra ""practice equals perfect."" If you work, you will achieve success. I, too, believe in this concept. However, one of Gladwell's implications within the chapter is that if one does not start pursuing a talent or goal at a young age, one will not be successful. He also says if an inadequate amount of hours are put into one's pursuit, achieving success will, too, be.unsuccessful. I personally believe if one works hard, and truly wants to attain success, they will. If they start at 30 or do not put 10,000+ hours into their endeavor, it isn't the end of the world. There is still hope and great probability that they will be successful. Another chapter that sparked my interest was ""The Matthew Effect."" In this chapter, Gladwell uses statistics to express one's age greatly affects their success. He does so by analyzing hockey players. The children, who are the older ones in the cut-off, seem to show a greater amount of skill than those who are younger. Yes, this may be a coincidence, but I personally think this is only due to the fact that they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. Here, the older children are given special opportunities. This then accumulates to bring greater success. ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests"" was another chapter that significantly interested me. Gladwell, in this section, explains because of Asians' language and cultural background, they are better at math and work extremely hard overall. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more commonsensical than Western languages. Therefore, Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than those of the American descent. Another argument behind his theory has to do with the significant amount of labor and strength farming rice entailed for Asians. Gladwell says that the Asian culture is overall more hardworking because of the immense amount of work had to be put in to producing rice paddies, and have consequently been shaped by their ancestors to work hard. I do see validity in Gladwell's points, but I can also easily pose arguments that go against what he says. As a student who has been in honors classes all her life, I have seen the broad spectrum of students who enroll in these higher-level classes. Yes, there are Asians present in the majority of these classes, but there are many Whites and Blacks as well. I firmly believe that all students, regardless of ethnicity, have to put in the same amount of work; The Asian culture and background does not give Asian students a predisposition to the importance of endurance and perseverance. When all is said and done though, Outliers was a very interesting read. Some chapters interested me more than others, but the book as a whole forced me to see the concept of ""success,"" as well as its make-up, in a new light. Growing up in the US, we are always told that ""as long as we work hard, we will be successful."" However, Gladwell presents his case for hard work as being not the only determinant of success.",0

In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",1
2449,"Great read. I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it for one of my criminal justice classes for assignments, however it didn't feel like a drag to read. I enjoyed reading it although at times it did get wordy. But I would honestly recommend this book.",1
2450,Five Stars. Excellent,2
2451,"Good Book and well written. The book is good, it makes you think on a different way on how the life has gone on a certain way to some people. Helps you to understand and accept what you are living, and try to identify the causes that could help you.",1
2452,"Stories of success and perhaps failure as well. I could'nt put down. It is full of insights that I had nerver considered. It emphasized that no one is a self made genius but rather the product of attachments to others that nurture along the way. Also great insights regarding prejudice and how it is learned inter-generationally as he writes about families like the Hatfields vs McCoys. We are all products of our environment with all of its nuancies/expectations that we are left to examine in our life times. A life not examined can feel lonely, dead, and leave your soul barren.",2
2453,"Five Stars. Gladwell has become my favorite author. This is a wonderful book, I recommend to everyone.",2
2454,"This shaped Shawn White the olympians career. I bought this book because Sean white has been an idol of mine since child hood and in Tim Ferris’ tribe of mentors, Shawn white proclaimed that this book had a huge impact on his career, he was a major influence in my life, I had the 2005 burton Shawn white snowboard, so I had to pick it up and gain the same insights he did, it’s a great read and If you’re going to read anything pick this up over the rest, it’s so diverse and you’ll touch on so many topics out of your regular zone of thinking it’s a very thought provoking book.",2
2455,Left Wanting More Graceful Storytelling. I respect the author's intention of breaking with the common notion of individualism and shedding light on how the individual story is really a small part of a larger one that has helped select people succeed by social standards.,0
2456,"Good read though, I wasn't bored..... Liked this a lot, but then I'm a chronic underachiever so I probably would.",1
2457,"Provocative and yet, inspiring stories. This book challenges the idea one have to be gifted to succeed and shows different perspectives of known success stories. There are much more than talent involved on those stories. The environment, the timing, the willingness to thrive with right attitude and hardworking seems to be much more important than the talent. Worth reading, well done Gladwell!",2
2458,"Racist, biased, and fatalistic approach to people. I heard about this book from the 10k hour rule and that was the only part I gleaned anything from.  As the book went on I felt more and more distanced from the authors clearly opinionated text.  As for the audio there was a slight ringing when my volume was high.  The actual performance was good itself.  I wouldn't recommend this book in the future.",0
2459,"Not Entirely Accurate, But Good Principles. Reading Outliers as someone with a couple decades of professional experience, and many years more of a committed drive toward excellence, I was encouraged. 10,000 hours sounds great. I have that easily and am enjoying success in my career. This book appeals to my ego, really.",0
2460,"fantastic book. This book makes me look at life in a different light, I love how the life experiences were put together.",1
2461,Five Stars. A good read that i really enjoyed.,2
2462,Ultimately Goes Nowhere. This deeply disappointing book ultimately goes nowhere.,0
2463,A Must read for anyone and everyone who is on a journey of self development. Loved every word,2
2464,Well researched and thoughtful. Malcolm Gladwell presents a well organized explanation of how great men and women have achieved their successes. It is a fascinating read with wonderful examples and clear explanations of his conclusions.,1
2465,"I enjoyed this book. Follow-up books can be tough. Like movie sequels, you can end up with a ""Grease 2"" or ""Caddyshack II"" at one end of the spectrum, to the ""Godfather"" series on the other. Happily, Outliers is closer to the good end of the spectrum, and in many ways, I enjoyed it more than ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"".",1
2466,"cultural traits. very thoughtful and interesting ,gives you more tools to process the whys as to the thought process of individuals and groups.",1
2467,"Secrets of Success. Although the author may have made some sweeping generalities in his pursuit of discovering the secrets of successful people, he writes in a most entertaining and persuasive style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",2
2468,Very intoxicating. Very insightful book which clears our misconceptions about various developmental phases in our lives since childhood that help us achieve success! I will recommend it to everyone. Just cannot keep it down!,2
2469,Four Stars. Good read,1
2470,"This book is easy to read and still very informative. This book is easy to read and still very informative. The ideas in here are not entirely new to me because as a teacher of gifted kids, I'd read Terman and already come to a disagreement with his research, but I certainly never thought about most of the ideas presented. I'm thinking I'd never again allow my children to be advances in school again. I think it disadvantages them in may ways. I'd rather keep them with their age mates and give them the advantage of being larger and more capable than the others.",2
2471,A unique explanation for why some do and some don't.. Gladwell finally explains what I had suspicioned without the tools to understand just why it is that there have been clumps of people that have been to successful within an era. A most fascinating read.,2
2472,"you just can't go wrong with Malcolm Gladwell.... I usually dont read more than one book from the same author (for this type of books) because i find that very often after a big hit, they tend to just repeat and try to squeeze whatever was great about that big hit the had but it is definitely not the case with MG. Yea, the style might be pretty similar which would be expected but the topics and his research just doesnt stop surprising me... Blink, david and goliath, outliers, all great books... I might go for the tipping point some time in the future..",1
2473,How Success Happened... Great Book. An interesting look at success and how it happened.,2
2474,Eye opener. Will make you reconsider all you think you know about what leads to success. This is not a self help book it is a self awareness book. Excellent eye opening and entertaining reading.,1
2475,"Thought provoking. One of the thoughts that came to me... educators everywhere should read this book and rethink their teaching methods if we want ""no child left behind"".",1
2476,"It is all about practice. While I don't agree with everything in this book, it explains the importance of practice with numerous examples. I recommend this book especially to people who have kids because it helps better shape our thought process with practical ideas.",1
2477,"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye.""",0
2478,Really Interesting Read. Delves into the factors for success and how multiple issues (beyond just hard work and smarts) play a role in highly successful people. It's a good quick read; thought provoking and a book I'd highly recommend.,1
2479,"Stellar Listen. This is a stellar listen. Story moves rapidly enough to keep one's attention, but paced enough not to lose the listener. Authour's reputation did not disappoint. I especially loved the way stuff hidden in plain sight about the story of success and mostly taken for granted can contribute so much to the subject...Makes listener reflect, relate and hopefully adjust to accommodate success in their own lives.",1
2480,wonderful book. This book talks about how extra-ordinary people became extra-ordinary .. its not about talent alone .. its about the other opportunities that these people got and took efforts to make themselves extra-odinary. Wonderful book.,1
2481,"Meh. Couldn't finish this one. The secret to success is to practice and put your work in? Duh. I like some of Gladwell's stuff, but this one didn't do it for me.",0
2482,Gladwell Strikes Gold ...Again. I am astounded every time I read one of Gladwell's books. His insights are unusual and thought-provoking.,2
2483,Five Stars. Great item,2
2484,Outliers. Love Malcolm Gladwell! This book arrived quickly and as described.,2
2485,Insightful. This book is excellent. It explained the unexplainable. It help me to better understand the world I live in. I was truely amazed at the explanation of how certain corners of society worked. It helped me to better understand myself and how I got to where I am.,1
2486,"If you want to know the real 'why' behind success .... If you want to know the real 'why' behind success, this is at least an essential piece of the answer.",2
2487,"Gladwell has done it again!. If someone had told me I would be fascinated by a book that starts out comparing birth dates of hockey players to their ability to play, I would have scoffed. Gladwell has done it again! He is an excellent, fact-based author who guides us through facts and figures we normally would have yawned over.....but he (as always) finds gems of truth in all he teaches us.",2
2488,"Very interesting. Well written, new information I haven't seen elsewhere. Very, very interesting. Malcolm Gladwell puts well known success stories into perspective. It's a good read. I recommend it.",1
2489,Good Read. In the beginning I was absolutely in love with the book but I kind of started to loose interest towards the end. I still think it's worth the read but I'm not raving about it as much as I was during the first few chapters. He uses some really interesting examples that really make you think. I also enjoyed the very casual tone/style of his writing he really speaks directly to the reader and gets his ideas accorss clearly. It was a quick read.,1
2490,Opens your eyes to what is obvious and overlooked. Success is not based in the individual alone in fact the individual is only a result of what shaped him/her and highly driven also by luck and timing.,1
2491,"My cat fell in love with this toy. My Siamese, who loves to play, was into this toy from minute one. It is very interactive and engages mentally and physically. I read the reviews before purchasing, but did not anticipate such an overwhelming reaction. She cannot walk by it without stopping to play. This stimulation is very important to me, as she is the sole kitty in the house and does not have a ""buddy"" to play with. I highly recommend this toy with regard to every aspect- cat appeal, construction and durability, cost and the fact it does not take up a lot of space. This is only the second product review I have ever written, so take that as an additional positive statement for this toy.",2
2492,"Well written, excellent read. Highly recommended.. Thought provoking ideas, challenging our very way of thinking about Success are explained simply and clearly. Well written. I wish to get latest version to understand some of recent successes in the internet field. Hope to find similar books to analyze success within Indian culture and context!",2
2493,Read It!. One of the most fascinating books ever published-amazing amount and scope of information in an entertaining and interesting format. It is among the top 5 books I have ever read,2
2494,"Causes one to stop and think. Really an interesting read! I can't quite ""buy"" some of his theories but it is so thought-provoking that I passed it along for all my adult kids to read, too.",1
2495,Very thought provoking.. This book caused me to re-evaluate my perceptions of success and how it is achieved. It is a great listen for parents of young children since parents can have a major influence on many of the contributing factors of success that are mentioned in this book. Enjoyable on many levels.,1
2496,"not particularly helpful. The book is a collection of stories, which is fine, but it's hard for me to believe the examples provided are actually representative of the population at large. There is little to no practical advice about how to make your own ideas come to life.",0
2497,"LADY LUCK in YOUR LIFE!. Absolutely fascinating ... goes to prove that LUCK, from birth date, year, environment (family and economy and climate) and technology (all or some of the above) play a huge role in how successful a person becomes!",2
2498,"Highly recommend!. This book is one of my favorites! Gladwell really hit the nail on the head with this one, as it exposes the mythical notion that one can (fully) succeed alone. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that will challenge your beliefs, enforce critical thinking, and expand your idea of what success means.",2
2499,"Excellent read. Excellent, easy to read and very insightful",2
2500,"About successful people, not real outliers. Was disappointed there was no discussion of iconoclasts.",0
2501,"Food for thought. There were many examples that were good but not enough emphasis on the whole point. I was kind of left thinking, ok, did I miss something? What was the conclusion? Some of the examples seemed far fetched and I wanted to glean from the writers knowledge something useful for me and mine. Not so sure that happened!",0
2502,"Another niche product by Gladwell, the master. Gladwell is like that old gent on SIXTY MINUTES who finds much meaning in details or events the rest of us might overlook. Want to know how to succeed? Practice, practice, practice!",1
2503,Great book. Interesting book. Well written. Good ideas.,2
2504,Five Stars. As advertised,2
2505,"Outliers- an insightful perspective in those outside the box. Glad well provides not only insight, but intensive research into understanding outstanding achievement. This text provides lessons for all of us to benefit in our own development.",2

You also need to be born at the beginning of the year, so that your age isn’t skipped by cut off dates. Finally, no matter your income, it’s all about who you know or what is available to you that others don’t have.",0
2509,"Good book. Very interesting book based on facts, well writing, makes me want to read more from him (gladwell). Fully recommend book",1
2510,"A bit boring. I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book. To be honest it’s a bit boring and author goes around same subject again and again. We stoped reading midway through. I don’t know may be it is a matter of taste, but we didn’t like it.",0
2511,Disappointing Effort. I was incredibly excited to get my hands on Outliers after reading both Blink and Tipping point in years past. I often call Gladwell my favorite author.,0
2512,Thank you. Thank you,2
2513,"not sure i was persuaded by some of the stories but nevertheless an interesting and easy read.. Interesting book, not sure i was persuaded by some of the stories but nevertheless an interesting and easy read.",1
2514,"Very interesting. This book gave me something to think about. i didn't know the history of these people, combined with the hours it takes to be successful. Good read.",1
2515,"Not as revelatory as you'd think. It takes lots of actual practice to master something. It also takes opportunities that are not in our control. So basically, Gladwell is trying to prove Calvinism (hard work + predestination). Pinpointing the web of circumstances that leads to success is something that we obsess over as a culture and Gladwell provides a very interesting analysis of how this works. But I do not feel like I heard any revelations here that I did not learn from my father when he encouraged me to get internships as an undergraduate.",1
2516,Eye opener. Will make you reconsider all you think you know about what leads to success. This is not a self help book it is a self awareness book. Excellent eye opening and entertaining reading.,1

2520,"Encouraging but not useful... Avoid if you are looking for suggestions from the book. The first chapter is good, but the latter chapters are becoming worse. I gave up on the fourth chapter, so cannot say much about the things after that. But for the first several chapters, not many practical suggestions are given other than working hard. The main theme is genius is not born genius, they are ordinary people. But how can you replicate their success? Woops, the book just doesn’t care. Pretty disappointed... Might be an encouraging book, but far from being useful.",0
2521,Gifted. Sent as a gift,2
2522,"Fascinating. This book had so much incredible information, and it gave me a new perspective in looking at achievements. The author had so many different subjects to explore.",2
2523,"Interesting. I felt the book was really well written and very interesting. However, I felt that it was based on anecdotal evidence without a tremendous amount of evidentiary substance.",0
2524,"Ground-breaking. Surprisingly well-written, with unexpected examples of success that no one has thought of before. It will definitely change the way you think about success and it dives deep into an exploration and discovery of its determining factors. Overall, go for it without second thought.",2
2525,"Interesting, but discouraging. The ideas and facts presented by Gladwell in Outliers are interesting and intensely thought provoking. However, there is a tendency to feel mildly disheartened by the theme of the necessity of opportunities and the large rejection of the idea of ""The American dream."" This happens largely in the first part of the book: ""Opportunity"". The first chapter discusses the accumulation of opportunities as a result of each other starting with something as simple as birthdate. The second half discusses the effect of a legacy set before us that is unchangeable and again could decide our future despite our having no control over it. Gladwell's method of mixing story telling with analysis and facts is impressive and keeps the book interesting, but the occasion undertone of condescension can be distracting. Having read his other book The Tipping Point and enjoying it greatly I was a little disappointed by Outliers, but nonetheless found Gladwell's ideas interesting despite feeling slightly depressed by it.",0
2526,Nice book. Different perception. Nice book. Different perception. Some of the examples are amazing. Was worth my time.,1
2527,Five Stars. I really enjoy reading another Gladwell's book.,2
2528,Straightforward transaction. Good item. Arrived on time.,1
2529,"No good time to read this book. I am so turned off by Gladwell other book and this book, I could not read Blink.",0
2530,"Good, easy read. I enjoyed it and found it very interesting because it's just nothing I've ever heard before, or told in that way. The stories were a bit long winded but the material is amazing.",1
2531,"Success and luck. Now we hear the rest of the story. A well written discussion of why some people with all of the right background, intelligence, and social status make big impacts while others don't. Spoiler: there is an element of being in the right place at the right time.",2
2532,"Amazing book. It's my second time reading this book and I'm still amazed at the stories told by Gladwell. What struck me is that after all, it's not those who are successful are outliers but those who not.",2
2533,"One of the most fascinating reads ever. Unless your offended by being called a *#&5*#$%.. fascinating book. As a southerner, though, I, too, would want to fight any jerk who called me what provoked southerners in a test that Gladwell writes about. Wish he would get the guts or whatever, to do the same instead of telling us southerner to adjust our behavior. Never be a gimp and tell someone how to act!",2

2536,"Anecdotal evidence. This book has an interesting concept and is well written if one likes to read newspaper articles. Given its author, its not suprising it is crafted in a journalistic style.

2541,"Good book! I even bought a copy for my .... Good book! I even bought a copy for my son to read. He's in college. The part Mr. Gladwell doesn't really discuss is the spiritual component of the stories he brings up in the book though. At the beginning he mentions this Italian town that moved to America and their great success. He mentions their faith as a key component to their success in this introduction story, but never brings it up again. Without this developed piece the book feels like it is missing something. But, even so, it is a great book. Very thought provoking!",2
2542,"Insightful, knowledgable and fun.. Brilliant book which really opened my eyes to how different factors other than so called ""pure genious"" can contribute to success. It was written in such a way that I didn't get bored and looked forward to reading it everyday.",2
2543,Four Stars. Great book to read,1
2544,outliers review. The book had a lot of interesting theories and info. I liked it and would read another,1
2545,"Amazing Book. This is a terrific book written by an Outlier himself, who is born of outliers.",2
2546,Five Stars. Good read.,2
2547,Make you think. Gladwell does a great job of making you think about successful people in a different light. He basically says that there are other events that occurred along the way that helped them become successful...no one does it alone.,2
2548,Great read!. Great book on success. It was all over the place while offering so many examples.,1
2549,Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read!. Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read! Love his concepts and research.,2
2550,Some Interesting Facts. A very well written and well researched book looking into why certain groups of the population are more successful than others.,1
2551,"It was not what I expected.. It was mostly focused on social and enviromental elements that impact on individual success. It is good for making teader more humble, modest and grateful, but doesn't provide insights on how control and influence the factors that are control-able by human being.",0
2552,"I didn't realize that!. Mr Gladwell's intelligence is evident on every page: and he shares it so well! There are so many interesting facts. I just loved the way he tied them together to explain things that we just take for granted. I generally read fiction, but I occasionally make exceptions. I am so glad I did, as I thoroughly enjoyed every word in this book.",2
2553,I enjoyed it!. Some very interesting stories in it but not as useful as I heard from people who recommended it.,1
2554,Inspiring call to action. I always enjoy malcolm gladwell's way of thinking. In this book he looks at what are the ingredients of success and the circumstances that lead them there.,2
2555,"Not Really About Outliers.. This books title leads you to believe that it's going to talk about statistical outliers, but it only nominally does that. Gladwell ignores actual outliers in the teeth of the statistical cases he presents.",0
2556,Very. It’s a very good book,2
2557,Learning Curve. I have learned a tremendous amount from this book. I teach students who are at risk in a small school district. This book's insights have given me much to think about as far as what motivates these students. I want to read more about this.,2
2558,"A fascinating book. While there's been a lot of discussion about the 10,000 hours theory and a lot of people have a problem with it, I found this book fascinating. It's a very easy read with a lot of clear examples. As a theory of expertise, with a lot of data to back it up, this book is excellent and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in why certain people become great in their fields.",2
2559,Good read but colored with author's viewpoint. This book is a good read and shines an interesting perspective on how people become successful. However it's also obvious that the author is using data to make points that align with his viewpoint without casting light on the whole story.,1
2560,"Another merry romp through the social sciences with profound conclusions.. Outliers is classic Gladwell. Well researched, impeccably storied and logically concluded. He takes us on journey after journey relating facts and experiences and tying them together in fresh ways to achieve new understanding of the complexities of life. Some are deceptively simple - you need 10000 hours of practice at anything to be truly proficient. Some more complex - cultural differences have huge bearing on how good you are at something. I loved it. It made me think and change my perceptions of schooling, genius and hard work. Thoroughly recommended.",2
2561,"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",2
2562,"Very Interesting!. Gladwell sets out to explain how the top people in any field were able to get there. The explanations can be very surprising. I was very engaged throughout the whole book. He talked a lot about education, and having been a public school teacher for the last 27 years, I found it absorbing, hopeful, and found myself wishing that I had known some of these things 27 years ago.",1
2563,"Useful. I liked this book. The stories and examples inside were very surprising, interesting and in many ways applicable when analyzing your own path to success.",1
2564,Very interesting read. Well thought and some provocative ideas put forward! A detailed historical account of success that makes one pause and reassess success!,2
2565,Four Stars. good book to read if you want to know about success,1
2566,"Very interesting, gives you more insights on the way our world evolved.. By providing an assessment on most of its characters and the main factors for it's subjects' success, the book gives you a more down to earth reasons for such brilliant careers and achievements such as the ones described in the book. Very good reading.",1
2567,"Insightful read!. It is a jam packed book dealing with dispeling the misconceptions of success we have in mind. Readers alike will be enthralled with a ""new"" definition of what it means to be a successful achiever. Moreover, the author uses data and evdence to corroborate the theories behind what makes a person reach the pinnacle of the ladder. It is a definite fresh take on many misleading theories we have. A brilliant and excellent read! appy reading viee",1
2568,used it for school. I used this book for school and while facts such as these don't make for fun listening but the information I gained was interest and a lesson learned and a different way of looking at why certain things happen.,1
2569,"A wonderful read which explores why some people succeed and others .... Well researched and explained book. A wonderful read which explores why some people succeed and others don't despite great effort. Also, timely given USA's recent discussions of white privilege and institutional racism. I found myself reading a chapter, or a part chapter, a night, so I could spend some time thinking about it the next day.",2
2570,Five Stars. Great read!!,2
2571,"SUCCESS? WHAT DOES THIS GUY KNOW ABOUT SUCCESS?!. AWFUL, BORING, (the author looks) CREEPY, DULL and I could go on and on and on! I literally had to FORCE myself to read this dreadful excuse for a book. Why this poorly developed sad excuse for a book ever got published, I'll never know, (it must be by the same idiots who thought Twilight was a good idea.) I love to read and usually can't put a book down, however, this was just begging for me to throw it across the room to it's rightful place-the toilet. The thought that students are being required to read this is pathetic and shows what a poor idea of literature certain teachers have in mind. Let the students read the classics, new books, science fiction, autobiographies, graphic novels, basically ANYTHING but this bore! In a few hundred years, a new breed of human (or maybe aliens) will be digging up remains of our civilization and questioning it's demise, and they'll uncover the Outliers, see teachers attempt to force their students to read and learn from it, and quickly realize why we went downhill. My family runs out of toilet paper fairly quickly, the only upside of owning this book is that we can use it for TP, in case the store is closed.",0
2572,Five Stars. Best book I've read in a really long time.,2
2573,"Some interesting ideas but nothing that hasn't been said before. I bought the book because it's GlDwell's bestselling work. I was a bit disappointed. His theories are actually fairly mundane and very often, he is repeating what has already been said before. The book lacks the insight that I was looking for. A mild disappointment.",0
2574,"Worthy Read: Gladwell's Intent. No, it [excellence] doesn't start with talent, it starts with love.",1
2575,"good. To me, it kind of dragged/",0
2576,"Great Book. What I took from this book is that success is largely based on practice and luck. It does a good job at showing how one seemingly minor decision can be the start to a career of success, without you ever knowing it then. It was a good book that seems often criticized by people claiming he twists his data to prove his theories, but a lot of what he says seems like common sense. For example the 10,000 hour rule. If you take it literally, you might think that 10,000 hours of practice magically results in success. That's an absurd criticism I've seen too much of. Take him seriously, and you'll understand that Gladwell isn't saying that at all.",1
2577,Fantastic Book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Well written; it is very hard to put down once you start reading!,2
2578,Enjoyable if a little meandering. The author works hard to distinguish fact from belief and in a very interesting way weaves a story that explains how much nature vs nurture act on the success of humans.,1
2579,Great book. This is one of the only books i have read with so much intrigue that I have actually come to finish. Well recommended!,2
2580,"Great reading, but not too much new here. I enjoy Gladwell's books - easy to read, entertaining and generally insightful. Outliers fits the bill, although he starts off with a basic assumption - ""We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit."" - that I'm not sure is all that valid. I think most people would agree that circumstance and luck also play a part in creating success, and that's essentially the point he's making in this book. As such, I wasn't blown away by any new insights here - more a validation of what I always believed. Nevertheless, I would still recommend the book.",1
2581,"Interesting, and Fun to Read (If Not Completely Earth-Shattering). I want this quote from Chapter 8 tattooed on my students’ foreheads: “Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds.” Nailed it. No better statement explains the difference between success and failure in my English and writing classes.",1

2586,"Great book, fast read.. Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is a great book about the outliers of success. Gladwell discusses several things throughout the book that are direct factors to success, such as hard work, opportunities, and - believe it or not - your ethnicity. Talent by itself will not get you to where you want to be in life. Hard work by itself will not get you where you want to be in life. Opportunities by themselves will not get you where you want to be in life. But if you combine talent, a good work ethic, opportunities, and being born or growing up at the right time, can lead you to a very successful life. Gladwell discusses cases like Bill Gates, who only became the founder of Microsoft because of several lucky breaks in his life, one being that he lived just minutes away from Washington University, who happened to be giving out free computer hours during the early 70's.",2

2590,"Highly Recommended - a definite read!. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  recently read your book Outliers for an assignment for my senior English class and found it very applicable to my class's essential question. The essential question varies depending on what grade the students are in and basically serves as the central theme for the entire course. This year, my class's essential question is, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" I have to admit that I did not really believe that our essential question had very much depth to it this year; I assumed that the answer was plain and simple. However, upon reading your book Outliers, I came to realize exactly how much time and place can affect a person. rom my understanding, the point that you set out to make in this book was that success is not inherent and that any one person's success can be traced back to a variety of factors. In order to prove this point, you take the reader through a variety of stories such as those of Mort Janklow, Chris Langan, and even Asian math students. In all of these stories, the importance of time and place stood out to me. For Mort Janklow, time was imperative to his success because it allowed him to find a job. In the cases of Chris Langan and Asian math students, it seemed that location was more important to their success than time was. While family environment influenced Chris, and cultural environment influenced Asian math students, it is obvious that their locations were determining factors in their successfulness. CONT.

2654,"Chris G.'s Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, hroughout the last semester, my high school English class has been reading and discussing ""Outliers"". For every lesson in this class, we try and tie it to our essential question, which is ""to what extent does time and place define a person?"" In ""Outliers"", this idea of time and place is brought up constantly throughout the book, with you constantly brining up the idea that outliers are the way they are due to the opportunities given to them instead of the commonly believed idea that they are outliers due to natural talent. In several instances in the book, people were given advantages in life based off of the time and/or place in which they were born. This was prevalent in the hockey players getting a large advantage if they are born in the beginning of the year, or even that Bill Gates was born during the right time and in the right place to be a pioneer in the computer industry. I really found both of these chapters interesting, as well as chapter 3 which focused on an IQ threshold. The first chapter, The Matthew Effect, was a very interesting concept to me. It was a great chapter to start off the book with because it gave a preface for everything to follow by explaining that hockey players born in the beginning of the year have a large advantage over those born later on. This concept makes a lot of sense, but it is just something that I have never really thought about. The second chapter, the 10,000 Hour Rule, was to me the most interesting chapter in the book. It went against all conventional knowledge that people were skilled at something based off of talent, and instead brought up the idea that they are skilled because of how much experience they have. The idea that you will master a field once you have performed 10,000 in it is also an interesting concept, although I do not know how true it is. Even though there are a few examples of it taking people 10,000 hours to master a subject, I still do not feel that value holds true in all circumstances. For example, I am sure that a lot of professional golfers have spent 10,000 hours on the game, and yet no one has come close to mastering it. Every golfer makes mistakes, and I feel that it will never be mastered. So while I think that the rule is a good general rule, it still does not hold true in every situation. Chapter 3's concept of an IQ threshold was also extremely interesting. Before reading this chapter, I had always thought that a higher intelligence would generally directly correlate to a higher level of success. However, after reading the chapter, I entirely agree with your viewpoint. Once the threshold is reached, social skills and networking are necessary to succeed. I have noticed that some people are able to make up for a lack of intelligence with their social skill. Even though someone has not reached the threshold, I believe it is still very possible for them to be more successful than someone who has. A lot of the concepts presented in your book hold true in my experiences with golf. The best players are generally those whose parents also play golf. This gives them an advantage they were born with that generally allows them to develop faster and practice more. This means that someone who is born with less skill but has this advantage can surpass someone with more skill but who lacks this advantage.",1

Also, chapter 5's discussion about the impact of demographic trough was fascinating for me, a late baby boomer. Overall, I appreciate MG's thesis: that ""success is not a random act [but] arises out of a predictible and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities."" (p. 155) The variety of examples that MG uses to illustrate his theories in all three of his books broadens his appeal and ""buy-in"" for his ideas.

At first glance, I figured it would simply be another book to read on my long ""To-Do List""; however, I quickly realized I was totally wrong. Outliers hooked me in from the very beginning and challenged the very way I look at success. I thought it was crucial for not only me to read it as a future educator, but all people should read this book as it will truly change the way you look at the world and your perception of others and their so-called success. Overall, great read and I highly recommend.",2
2667,"Great read. The author does a great job of explaining why although it appears some individuals are outliers, they really are not. It’s a wonderful read.",2
2668,"His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative. Gladwell's writing is capable both of being utterly convincing (the phrase ""selling ice to an Eskimo"" comes to mind) and of taking a simple truth readers already know (that success comes from our own very specific, cultural circumstances - in addition to hard work) and making it seem as though it is shockingly novel and groundbreaking (his thesis focuses on trends of success that are counter to, or sometimes not even considered in, our expectations).",1
2669,Very interesting reading. This is a well written book giving a new perspective on success. It appears that it is more than raw talent that determines the likelihood of a successful life.,1
2670,Five Stars. My husband loved this book.,2
2671,"Gladwell is over-rated. After reading all three of Gladwell's books (Tipping Point, Blink, and Outlier), I have pretty much figured out his formula. Glackwell is half black as well as a Canadian. Basically, he writes about things that would normally be politically incorrect for a white person to write about. For example, according to Gladwell, Asians are good at math because they come from a culture of growing rice. He does this from behind the ""shield"" of being half black, so of course he can't possibly be implying anything racist or ethnocentric. In addition, Gladwell has a very obvious ideology that he is espousing - essentially that of a political liberal who believes that the individual is less important than the culture he comes from or the lucky advantages the individual enjoys. In other words, the important thing is the collective.",0
2672,"Ok Book For Those In The Know, Great Book For Those Unaware. Gladwell's insights are helpful in some ways in describing a very small percentage of the popular outlier stories. But I think it places a little bit too much emphasis on luck and opportunity rather than on gift, intellect, and pure skill. For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things. However, I think if you put someone else in Bill Gates shoes, events would not be guaranteed to turn out the same just because that `someone else' was in place of Bill Gates luck and opportunity.",1
2673,Good. Was an interesting read. New insights to ponder on success. I found some of the stories and points a bit too repetitive at times.,0
2674,"Meh.. a little patronizing at times. get to the point, Gladwell!",1
2675,"Another page turner. Another great book by Malcolm Gladwell. If you like his other books this one will not disappoint. Gladwell explains why some people achieve great success while some other, equally gifted and hardworking people do not. Gladwell posits that success is based on a unique set of circumstances that are outside of the successful person's control and then does a pretty good job of proving his point. While he never dismisses the factors of effort, talent and hard work, he does put these in perspective and the context of unique opportunity. In a very personal and interesting conclusion, Gladwell fits the theory to his own family and his own success.",2
2676,"Another great Gladwell book.. Strongly recommended. Easy read but inspiring. As usual, Gladwell opens your eyes to illustrate what you've always looked at but never really saw",2
2677,"What storytelling!. Gladwell’s prowess at building beautiful stories and deriving meaning out of them is unparalleled. The diversity of examples he uses to draw his central theme is incredibly vast, and offers the readers a lot of insights into several cultures and times in history. A very easy read, that lends a lot of perspective still.",2
2678,"Extremely inspiring! This book offers an alternative perspective on the requirement for success. 'Outliers' is really a masterpiece. It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",1

2681,"Late to the Game. Though I’m late to this book, I did find it interesting. There are many things that shape our lives, and so it makes sense from that standpoint that who we are isn’t so much of who we are but how others influence us to be who we are.",1
2682,"Much more than 10,000 hours. I came to this book for it popularising the 10,000 hour theory - some say over-simplifying. I was surprised and then delighted to find that is just one reference in a book drawing together many insightful ideas to unpick the myths of what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field. But as Malcolm Gladwell reveals, there are other factors, many beyond our control, which should keep us humble if successful and tolerant of those who missed out. I look forward to reading his other books.",2
2683,"How time and opportunity intersect. The premise of Mr Gladwell's book is that great achievement is partially determined by when are where you were born. This in itself will come as no surprise but the author succeeds in making a science of it. For example, if you wanted to be part of the computer revolution, 1955 USA was the best time and place to be born. All the major founders of Apple and Microsoft were born between 1953-1957 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both born perfectly in 1955. That is not the only example but I have read other books of this author and this is another fascinating read. Highly recommend.",2

While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me?

The author suggests success is less about individualism and more about being in the right place at the right time. There are a lot of interesting antecdotes which support this thesis. But as someone who has indeed become successful because of hard work, I somehow came away from this book feeling diminished.",0
2702,"Luck. People are great because hard work, but in every great success story there is luck. This book examines what external events helped bring three luck.",1
2703,One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people. One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people,2
2704,Amazing insight into how factors outside our control affect success. This is a must read for anyone who wants to truly understand how difficult it is to attribute success to merely hard work or intelligence. There are other factors at play and they can amplify or dampen anyone's success.,2
2705,"Great Listen though no practical advice.. Malcolm's books are always thought provoking and out there. I found this one so inspirational, that the second time I listened to it, I made my 14 yr old daughter listen to it. She found it facinating and I heard her talking about parts of it to her friends.",1
2706,One Star. I'm finding this book tedious.,0
2707,"Journalism and pseudoscience. Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",0
2708,"AWFUL. WORST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!!!!!! i have been reading this book for over a month now, ad school starts wednesday!! I am so sick of this book!! It doesnt even make sense!!! Worst book i have every read in my life!!!!",0
2709,I should have read this years ago. Well written and the bulk of the points are worth considering. I should have read this book when I was was starting out on a career,2
2710,A must read. Gladwell insights,2
2711,reading this review on a computer makes you a chosen one. It will allow you to appreciate your life's condition as a result of blessed luck and opportunities realized.,2
2712,intresting but at times a stretch. Very engaging author with an interesting premise. Some of the connections are far fetched but none the less well presented.,1
2713,Interesting book. Read this book and while it can be dry at times with facts and figures the premise is at least interesting. I do not agree that all success is a result of environment but it would be foolish to ignore that there is impact.,1
2714,"Inspiring. Good book, another perspective. Easy to read. I agree with most of his ideas, however some of them are not convincing at all.",2
2715,Thought provoking. This book provides a lot of food for thought. Outliers is written so even my parents can understand and appreciate the principles surrounding hard work and opportunity it discusses.,1
2716,Very interesting. Very interesting,1
2717,Interesting and thought provoking. Pulling together multiple strands of experience and narrative into a single whole is done well. I certainly hadn't quite realised the extent to which our dates of birth affect life chances of individuals.,1
2718,Four Stars. Gladwell does it again. Very interesting read,1
2719,"Eh..... A short handbook meant to be a cheerleader-type moral-booster for people who don't ""stand out"" enough. 10,000 hour rule? What an original rewording of the American Dream. I appreciate the fact that he acknowledges the reality of the ""fruits"" of hard work, though. A fun read, but Outliers' argument is based on fallacies and anecdotal evidence. This is basically pseudopsychology mixed in with a bit of imagination.",0
2720,Five Stars. perfect,2
2721,"Best non-fiction. This is the most entertaining nonfiction book I think I have ever read. It deals with what outside forces cause a person to become successful. Things like year of birth, nationality, supportive community, etc. I highly recommend this book to just about anyone.",2
2722,Highly recommend.. Excellent book.,2
2723,"Summary: Success does not happen in a vacuum. If you are under the impression that all successful people have gotten to where they are by their own merits alone, then this book may hold some insights for you. If not, you will find nothing but obvious truths and cherry-picked anecdotes presented as unscientific evidence that all success comes directly from external opportunity with complete downplay of personal efforts. The tracked on interview at the end underscores this unfounded view. The one high note was an interesting examination of the correlation between month of birth and success in professional hockey.",0
2724,"amazing read!!. Gives a totally realistic perspective on people that are considered geniuses. Also proves the fact that nothing holds each one of us from achieving our true potential, provided the environment is right, and more importantly the respective individual has the drive, patience and persistence to achieve his / her goal(s) in life or career!!",2
2725,"Great book: Best read after a while.... I've also read a few other books like The tipping point, Blink and Talking to strangers written by Malcolm Gladwell these all are gems. Outliers is also a great volume of an extraordinary series of books.",2
2726,Excellent book. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting as I couldn't put it down. Interesting and thought-provoking.,2
2727,"Couldn't put it down!. Very interesting, meticulous research. Ended with some personal family history, which I loved. My only criticism is that it seemed to end abruptly. i don't know if it was because I was enjoying it so much or it was a crash landing (pun intended). I highly recommend it and have been quoting from it since I read it.",2
2728,Great read. Very sound principles.,2
2729,"Its not as simple as that.. In Outliers, Gladwell tries to pinpoint the logic behind people's success. According to Gladwell, no longer does success stream from high IQ or self-intelligence, but more from a legacy and luck. As Gladwell puts it ""it's being in the right place at the right time"". In a nutshell - opportunity + hard work = success ccording to Outliers, achieving success is solving a formula, but can achieving success be as clear-cut as this? Of course not. ersonally, I couldn't really get into this book. Though it did have some very interesting points I had not thought of, the book runs off on way to many tangents that only lead to illogical conclusions with a deep lack of practical intelligence. s a writer, Gladwell has a comfortable and flowing writing style. Though outliers is an engaging read at times, I would stay away unless I want to get bombarded with illogical conclusions and boring unrelated facts.",0
2730,Four Stars. Mr Gladwell way of describing facts is always illuminating,1
2731,Great read for anyone interested on how success is achieved - it's will blow your mind.. What a wonderfully written book about how opportunity is the key factor to success. It really makes you think about your own life and the events that occurred during the earlier years that might have shaped you into what you are today. I don't often read books but this one was recommended to me by a few people and found that I had a hard time putting this book down. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested on how success is achieved - it will blow you away.,2
2732,"False attribution to the success of Outliers. Very good, although what lacks substantially here is how each outlier benefited more from luck than the ""10 000"" hour rule. By luck, I mean it more in the Japanese sense of the intersection of insight and opportunity. There are thousands of skilled athletes and programmers than can put in 20, 000 hours and will never become GOATs. So manage your expectations accordingly.",0
2733,great read. Really interesting read that can be applied to other great people in the world. As a father in waiting definitely left me with some interesting thoughts ob how to educate my kid,2
2734,Eye Opening and Thought Provoking. One of those books everyone should read. A different way of looking at things we all assume we know all about already.,2
2735,Second time around. This is the second time I have read this book and it won't be the last. Each time I glean fascinating facts and read accounts of unlikely scenarios which form beautiful pictures in my mind's eye. The explanation as to why people or groups succeed despite appearances of a lack of opportunity is fascinating and gives me hope that maybe I am on the right path.,2
2736,"M. Gladwell. Another good one by M. Gladwell. Well read, clearly stated, good voice and diction. I’m a fan of his books and continue to be one.",1
2737,"Interesting dialogue. Interesting information, but no usable information to grow. Seems like there would be some action items to help drive improvements.",0
2738,"Great reading and informative. Really enjoyed reading this informative yet down to earth book about achievers. Did not have to agree with every conclusion to both learn and appreciate the author's thoughts. Maybe that was because I have always felt that environment and timing were key attributes of success. Remember one individual who was reverred by many as a guru of entrepreneurism, who, after his first success, had a string of failures in later endeavors. One of the reasons is that his first firm was timed perfectly for the market, while the others weren't.",2
2739,"Overrated book. The ""statistical"" arguments he uses are ridiculous and he gives no acknowledgement to the role of innate talent. But there are some good anecdotes and it sheds some light on why some people are successful while others aren't.",0
2740,Five Stars. Well told stories about outliers.,2
2741,Worth it!!. Great read. Makes you think,2
2742,Very Informative. Very informative,1
2743,That's how you compare apples to oranges.. I wish some points were longer but loved Maxwell's ability to compare apples to oranges.,1
2744,Great Read. I loved this book! I highly recommend it to all of my friends and family members. Malcolm Gladwell really did a great job of showing what a success story is and how anyone can be successful; it's all about who is going to take advantage of what is given. Definitely re reading and passing along the messages that I have taken away from it.,2
2745,"Easy read; not many actionable takeaways. I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",0
2746,"Very thought provoking. Absolutely loved Outliers! Very well written and with so many fascinating points. I want to read it again to make sure I picked them all up! (Be aware that this is not a quick and easy read; it requires your full attention and time, but it's so incredibly rewarding and fulfilling!)",2
2747,"A book that in a nutshell comes down to being .... A book that in a nutshell comes down to being born at the right time and/or place. For the rest, if you want to succeed, then you have to put in 10k hours of effort to become an expert in a particular subject.",0
2748,"Great book. Great book, easy to read, REALLY interesting. Bought this because I saw Gladwell's TED ""David and Goliath"" talk and decided to start out with this book before reading that one. It is very interesting and very easy to read, although there is an issue with the side notes and the e-version, so that detracted from the experience, but that's Amazon's fault, not the authors.",2
2749,"Outliers. The research supporting the authors thesis was quite interesting. Altogether, I thought the book had some interesting insights and it was an easy read.",1
2750,"Good book but information not overly surprising. I liked this book because it gave a different view on success that underplayed the role of genetics. It won't tell you the secret to success but a running theme was hard work and practice practice practice is what makes you an expert and thus, successful according to today's standards. There were also some interesting points about parenting and about the American school system which I'll have to keep in mind if I have kids sometime down the road...",1
2751,Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. What a fascinating book!,1
2752,"Inciteful, Interesting, and Compelling Read. Malcom Gladwell returned with another stellar read. Not only was this book filled with facts, it was interesting and well written. I was engaged and curious until the last pages.",2
2753,"Insightful, logical, but missing some information. This book was very interesting and kept me engaged with insightful stories until the end. There is a pretty significant error in the middle of the book where the author concludes that since Nobel Prize winners are represented by all IQ levels equally above 120, that enabling a larger number of moderately intelligent people into top colleges (all other variables constant) would cause a higher number of intelligent people to produce Nobel worthy accomplishments. This conclusion does not take into consideration the fact that there are a much higher quantities of people with average to marginally above average intelligence than there are brilliant.",1
2754,This Guy definitely thinks outside the box - Good book. I enjoyed reading and entertaining the concepts in this book of which most made perfect sense. It's a good read.,1
2755,Fascinating. Malcolm did very well to warm up the story with the setting of the background. I was fully impressed with the study on the Korean Airlines revelations,1
2756,"Here's hoping I was born in a good year. Malcolm Gladwell has given us another page turner. After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",1
2757,The true story of success. It is a well written book inclusive of proven researched issues. It is also an easy read with glaring examples of points to clarify all issues made.,2
2758,"We can all be outliers and this book explains how!. What is an Outlier? How do people become outstanding in their field? Are the born with a skill? Do you have to learn a skill? Do you have to be born at the right time? Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”? The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time. Were they the brightest or the best? As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",2
2759,Three Stars. Sets out well but gets stale about 70% in,0
2760,"Success is a combination of hard work, persistence, .... Success is a combination of hard work, persistence, family support and, according to the author, LUCK!!!! I can relate many successful aspects of my life to LUCK",1
2761,A thousand words read make you the expert. An interesting proposition well illustrated through examples but it follows the Gladwell formula. You'll enjoy it if it's a first but there are few surprises for sociology aficionados .,0
2762,"A real page-turner. I was recommended this author, and I wanted to know more about how and why some people, over others, are successful and what deems 'success in life', so the combination of author and subject resulted in me not being able to book the book down. This well known author lives up to his worthy reputation with skilful writing backed up with exhaustive research and explanations.",2
2763,"This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theor. This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theories about what makes a person successful in what they do. It is suggested that much of success is a product of simple (and not so simple) luck. Circumstances and coincidences play a huge role in what makes someone succeed, especially in cases of extraordinary levels of achievement. Another major factor analyzed is practice. It has been found that anyone committing to 10,000 hours (which takes about 10 years out of a lifetime) of practice or dedicated work/study is most likely to excel in that field. While these facts and notions are daunting, it is also promising to think that with enough dedication and time a person might be able to accomplish almost anything. ichael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel &amp;ldquo;To Be Chosen&amp;rdquo;",0
2764,Valuable Knowledge. I used this audiobook when I was reading with the actual book in my hands. I love to read and listen at the same time. I hope the audiobooks would be more affordable.,1
2765,Five Stars. Very interesting reading:-),2
2766,Five Stars. Simply you need to read this book.,2
2767,"convincing story of success. The author definitely has gotten his ten thousand hours of practice in the nurturing environment. The book is written clearly and convincingly. If this is not enough, there are many good videos on youtube, where he further elaborates his point. Do possess necessary prerequisites (iq sufficient for university or height for basketball), work hard in supportive environment, have your feet firmly on the ground, and the success is likely to come. Of course, there may be systemic (chronological, cultural, etc.) obstacles. Blame these if success didn't happen or be grateful if you were lucky",1
2768,"Where are the women?????????????. Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book. On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!! There are plenty of examples today so leaving out half the population is unacceptable. Leaving out half of the population also makes it easy to justify your argument!",1
2769,"Gladwell Impresses Yet Again. What does your birthday have to do with the likelihood of you striking it rich as a technology CEO? Why do some very smart people succeed and other equally smart people fail? Is there more to success than simply talent and hard work? I don't want to say anything else lest I spoil Gladwell's carefully-researched answers, so I'll just say that you should read the book. It's a good one.",2
2770,Kinda shitty. Not much useful information at all. Not even all that interesting. So many ideas could’ve been easily summarized.,0
2771,Great Read. Great story teller. My favorite author who is always looking at unique subject from a different angle. In some chapters too much details which make it a bit boring.,1
2772,Very Interesting Read. I think this one of the most interesting book I have ever read. It has very good examples for the advice that is given. The success stories are very interesting as well. I recommend for anyone who wants to be an expert or virtuoso or even just a parent who wants there child to be a success.,2
2773,"Interesting Info, not the greatest narrator. The information in the book is fascinating -- it's incredible how much our circumstances determine our successes and how relatively little our so-called ""innate talents"" or ""drive"" do. That being said, I feel that Gladwell could have given more rounded history and perhaps more encouragement to those of us who haven't been doing X activity since age 5. Gladwell also isn't very good at inflecting his voice when he quotes others in the reading, making it difficult on occasion to tell when he's quoting. Towards the end he also gets a bit singsong-y. Overall very worth the listen.",1
2774,Interesting perspective on success.. This was an interesting explanation of the factors which played a pivotal role in producing the world's most successful people.,1
2775,Best Book I've Read in Awhile. Malcolm Gladwell is fast becoming one of my favorite writers. His style of explaining complex concepts through storytelling is both effective and entertaining. I started reading Blink right after I finished outliers it was so good.,2
2776,Right place right time. This book puts a new and old slant on being in the right place at the right time and taking advantage of it. easy read.,1
2777,"Didn't quite live up to expectations. I am a great fan of Malcolm Gladwell and had high expectations of this book having read both Blink and The Tipping Point. However, this book isn't quite in the same league.",0
2778,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.",2
2779,"great book. A gift I gave to 1 of our sons. After reading it, he recommends to his younger brother and friends.",2
2780,A good read. A good read,1
2781,"Outstanding!. Malcom Gladwell does another fine job of storytelling while informing the reader of things they likely hadn't considered. It drives a stake through the heart of the American fantasy of ""I made it all on my own"" - ""I'm a self-made person"".",1
2782,enlightened. this gives new meaning to being in the right place at the right time and timing being everything.,1
2783,Great. my son had to have this book for school. Came in perfectly new,2
2784,One of my favorite reads. Love this book,2
2785,Perfect for you if you want to see the world .... Perfect for you if you want to see the world a different way and dig a little deeper in interesting subjects.,2
2786,"Interesting. ...if you like statistics and stories, which Malcom Gladwell is famous for. But I would have appreciated a bit more ""how to"" than just the stories. Some good stuff though. I see a lot of my daughter and how she handles my grandson in the pages. Good for her! She must have picked up a lot from this long time ago because he is an Outlier. :)",1
2787,"highly recommend. Outliers affirmed some of my personal theories regarding success and what makes or breaks people on their way. On the other hand, the research and personal stories were both fascinating and eye opening. I would definitely recommend this book for those who work in the field of education, but it is a good read for almost anyone who wants to learn.",2
2788,"This book will change your ideas about what causes people to be successful!. This book was surprising & eye opening! It gives very plausible reasons why some people are so successful or talented. It’s not because they have natural talent, either! It also explains how a pilot’s culture can cause a plane to go down. This is the most interesting book I have read in a very long time. It gives great hope to anyone who wants to be very good or great at something! It’s easy to read & very enlightening!!!",2
2789,Five Stars. Great,2
2790,Outliers: The Story of Success. I liked Tipping Point better. Outliers is an interesting concept but some of the stories of outliers seemed contrived. Gladwell includes his own family story in the concluding chapter.,0
2791,"Reading group. A must read, and share. What an eye opening book. I could see all my children in it, and I have changed some of my parenting because of it",2
2792,Better than Blink. Excellent book - great insight and very well written. Gladwell is an excellent author and this is one of my favourite pieces.,2
2793,Good sized book to fit in your luggage or handbag. Not finished this yet (40 per cent through ) but book arrived in gold quality as per Amazon standard. Interesting book about the impact of socio economic factors and luck paved the way for some of the world's most recognisably successful entrepreneurs/athletes.,2
2794,"Near Miss. Oh silly me. Here I thought that creating opportunity, providing rich and diverse experiences, private education, service opportunities, devoted love and attention was going to be sufficient to put my son on a trajectory to a successful life. I have had the joy of experiencing a gaze into the eyes of my new born and seeing there, the faces of my family long dead but now alive in the hope of a bright future. This book declares the obvious in a narrow frame of personal experience supported by some social and historical snippets. I was almost convinced.",0
2795,Four Stars. When you aré a teacher it gives you insight. As a parent it all make sense,1
2796,Five Stars. Very interesting reading:-),2
2797,"Not entirely new Idea but pleasure to read.. Like other bestsellers Blink and Tipping point, Malcom Gladwell has written compelling stories. He has tried to find out what makes people successful. This book is not about how to be successful, but tells about how opportunities and legacy play role in life of successful people. This book is more about the circumstances where one has little control over and how these circumstances affect us, Except 10,000 hour rules, which explains how hard work and persistence is more important than intelligence and innate talent.",1
2798,"Good Read. This book was an interesting read with a lot of though provoking premises. I was a little less mind blown than I'd hoped to be, but it was still very interesting.",0
2799,Made well just a stupid book. Had to read for school.,0
2800,"Excellent transaction. Came very quickly and in the excellent condition specified in the listing. Very satisfied customer. Now I just need time to actually read the book! (Really enjoyed ""Blink"" from the same author, so looking forward to reading this one.)",2
2801,"OUTLIERS OUTLINE. I'm a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. I think his research and writing skills are sublime; however, in Outliers, a book about about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary, he gets carried away.",0
2802,Five Stars. Great book. Now I see way it's so popular,2
2803,very informative. I learned a great deal about what must occur to be exceedingly successful. The author uses unique and varied examples to promote his hypothesis.This is a very clever book I am giving it as gifts to my reader friends.,2
2804,"Mesmerizing!. I had purchased this book some time ago and, having put it aside for some long forgotten reason, picked it up again thanks to a friends passing comment about it. Thank God for that, because I now agree with my friend's observation that Gladwell is ""the best story teller of them all"".",2
2805,Three Stars. Read for school about success puts different perspective on success!,0
2806,"An excellent misinterpretation of reality. Gladwell is an excellent researcher, phenomenal writer, and a fantastic reader perfectly suited for Audible. I’m grateful for every chapter of this book. His premise, privilege of race and opportunity are the destroyers of a belief in rugged individualism is debunked by his own research into those who’s drive to succeed lead them to prepare, to take any advantage they could find, and never to quit in a country that rewards those who do such. Gladwell’s remarkable research also proves that parents are the greatest influence in a child’s success or lack thereof. Parents instill work ethic, feed or starve emotional intelligence, and elevate or lower their children’s view of their own potential in the world. His assertion that uncontrollable forces such as time of birth and family of birth only reinforce the truth that parents should consider their role sacred.",1
2807,"Will make you question who you are. This book will make you question who you are - where you come from, what's your legacy, and what helped you accomplish whathever you've achieved so far in your life. It will also make you ask, do I have 10,000 hours of experience in something so far? Recommended read.",2
2808,"I highly recommend the book to everyone. Malcolm answered a question that I always wondered about on how other people seemed lucky and appeared to have everything working for them. He had an ingenious way to tell his family story throughout this book, which made me more appreciative of reading the OUTLIERS and getting to know who is Malcolm.",1
2809,Excellent read.. Great book! This book had some very great points and it was an enjoyable read.,2
2810,"Beatles analysis a little bit off. First of all, I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a stimulating read and I finished in a few hours. It was hard to put down, and I came away with some interesting new observations that, like one reviewer here said, will make for useful cocktail party conversation. The book has my recommendation.",1
2811,Five Stars. Summer reading,2
2812,Great read. Great book,2
2813,"You make your own luck. Fascinating read. I like how Gladwell addresses the elephant in the room that luck is indeed a factor in success. Certainly not the ONLY factor, but it's a factor (along with talent and practice). I highly recommend this book to everyone, especially parents and young people.",2
2814,"A Fascinating and Thought Provoking Book. I read this book, because it is on my daughter's summer reading list. Some of those books have been very inspiring. This is is one of them. It's written well enough to read in a few days, but if there's time to stop and think about what the stories mean for our culture.",2
2815,An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be .... Really interesting pop psychology/sociology. An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be regurgitating down the pub later.,2
2816,"I could not finish this book. Oh wait, I couldn't even get start. I could not finish this book. Oh wait, I couldn't even get started.",0
2817,"A seminal work!. Outliers looks at how successful people achieve success. Shaped by faith, culture, ""chance,"" and work, no one achieves success on their own! An insightful work looking into the facts and the soul of success, in whatever way you may define it. The last few chapters moved me to tears and the stirring epilogue, stamped the theme of this book powerfully on my heart; I hope it moves you as it moved me! Truly, a seminal work!!",2
2818,"Can the critics be right and still deserve 5 stars?. Sure, Gladwell picks his studies and anecdotes to prove his points. It's not fair to say his information is unsupported, he does cite plenty of research to support his theories. Anyone can be a cynic and claim that he is biased or that he is fake and catchy. The real point is, it's inspiring. Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity. Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable. I think it's a good estimate of the truth. I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world. We are humans, we live in our heads and our hearts, and Gladwell explores what it means to be human, with the limitations and possibilities.",2
2819,"Friendly style and simply brilliant, buying copies for friends!. What I really love about this book is the way Malcolm Gladwell 'speaks' to the reader. I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?! An excellent read - some really persuasive stuff - great topics and theories to spark debates amongst friends and colleagues!",2
2820,"Wow. That's a book that makes you change the way you look at the world, and how you can make your way through it successfully! Bravo",2

2824,"This is one of those books that give popular nonfiction a bad name. Which is unfortunate, because what could be better than books that both educate and entertain? But Outliers embodies everything that people who sneer at the genre are talking about: its conclusions are both obvious and simplistic, its writing persuasive but glib. It’s easy to see why Gladwell is a popular author: he’s a good storyteller, his writing accessible and entertaining. But this book is so riddled with oversimplified con",0

2830,"Certainly Makes You Think About Success. You will never look at someone who says they are self made the same way again. I have always been a great believer in fate...but thinking in Outlier terms, there is definitely more at play that simple fate. Factors that are simply out of your control are more determinate than your own decisions and efforts...take nothing away from those as well.",1
2831,Four Stars. An entertaining mix of statistics and anecdotes.,1
2832,"But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be. The central message percolating within Outliers is the context of one's life must never be ignored nor given short shrift. But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled? We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person. How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives? Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success? Do we really have a handle on that? Was Stalin a success because he got the metro system in place in Moscow? Was Micky Mantle a success because he built a Hall of Fame career? Was Charles Dickens a success because he wrote critically acclaimed and immensely popular novels? Are we certain we know what a successful life is?",2
2833,"Good read. This is an interesting book. It seems to be well researched and the referenced studies are incorporated into the text very naturally. It's not a difficult book to read, and if you had a long journey coming up I'd recommend this book as a travel companion.",1

2837,"Gladwell is just smart enough.... Gladwells bias towards cultural influence completely skews his ability to see how truly unique many of his ""examples"" are. Like the other Gladwell books I feel as if he is to smart to have missed the obvious fact that these ""examples"" have still accomplished what others who have had similar ""privilege"" have not. Gladwell cherry picks each persons story in an attempt to prove his point while failing to tell each persons whole story. Once again I feel railroaded.",1

2873,my review. I haven't finished yet but this piece of shit wouldn't let me read with out review boom boom boom boom,0
2874,"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards. Given all the rave reviews and how influential this book has purportedly been, I wasn’t expecting to feel so meh about it.",0
2875,"Attributes everything to chance. The book very much glosses over all aspects of success other than pure luck, largely ignoring that things like work matter.",0
2876,"Outliers is very enlightening. I've always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and articles,and this book is no exception. He always has a ""not so fast"" response to our preconceptions.",2

2884,outliers 101. Interesting fun read. As usual Gladwell seems to drift from the subject at hand. He rambles aimlessly about something that just popped into his head and tries to make you beleive he knows what he is talking about.,1
2885,"Definitely worth the read!. This book was required for my English 101 class. It was a fantastic read! Malcolm Gladwell challenges his readers to look for the patterns in success. Every chapter drew me in and sometimes I was wondering where he was going. Then he brings all his data to a conclusion and leaves you saying, ""wow.""",2

2892,"Pick it up and read it!. I am a real fan of Malcolm Gladwell. This book is another home run, in my opinion. His revelations about human behavior are always interesting, make sense and are surprising, nonetheless. He thinks outside of the box. Every parent and teacher should read ""Outliers"" for insight into what goes into success and how little things can help or hinder all of us. I find his books so interesting that I usually read them twice. If you have never read Gladwell, pick this one up and then work your way through his other books.",2
2893,"good book. very intriguing. some excellent points made about how outliers are really the product of environment, circumstance, and opportunities.",1
2894,"Not What I Expected. Although a few of the stories were interesting, I was lead to believe there were more interesting life stories told.",0
2895,"Incredibly Interesting!. I finally got around to reading Outliers, I'm a fan of Gladwell's other books, and this one may have been his best work yet. I've long held the belief that most of our actions are half chance and our ""success"" highly depends on others, just as much as it does ourselves. Gladwell's writing and research supports this opinion and shows the relationship between hard work and luck. It is certainly a book that will make you think twice about how we view the world, and will provide you a better understanding of how society functions going forward.",2
2896,"Dear Malcome Gladwell. Dear Malcome Gladwell,  am currently a senior at Hatboro Horsham High School, and for English class we were assigned to read your book, it was actually our first assignment. See this course is structured around one essential question: In what ways do place and time impact a person? So the theme of your book fit in quite well. Our class discusses a bit more then just what impacts success, but the examples in the book were intriguing. ersonally my favorite chapter was chapter nine, Maritas Bargain. This story really inspired me. I think it's safe to say that everyone in the world has the desire to be successful at something; it could be big or small. But not everyone is willing to work hard in order to achieve success. The level of commitment and hard work this little girl puts in on a day to day basis is magnificent. It made me reevaluate how much effort I put into my daily activities, and made me want to work harder. hapter two was another one of my favorites. Before I even read the book I'd heard about the 10,000 hour rule and the idea made a lot of sense to me. I believe that practice really does make perfect. I don't think anyone can get truly good at something without putting in hours of hard work. Sometimes when I look back I wish that I had spent a little more time practicing things, like soccer or drawling. Who knows how good I might be right now if I had spent 10,000 hours practicing. But then again maybe I'm accumulating hours for something that is not quite as ordinary, and I don't even realize. astly there was chapter three, the trouble with geniuses. This wasn't one of my favorite chapters, but I do think many of the points you made were fascinating. When I think of the stereotypical vision in my head for someone who is successful I automatically think of someone who is incredibly smart. But being smart isn't everything, and I agree with the fact that there are different kinds of smart. I believe creativity is also important to becoming successful. And for that reason I am thankful that I have a creative side. Even though I'm only in high school I have seen this in action. A lot of the things we do in school require a basic knowledge, but what really makes one students work stand out from another's is their creativity. And frankly sometimes the smartest person in the group isn't the one who ends up doing well.  hope one day I will be an outlier; that my success will make me standout from the crowd. And when I look back and remember reading your book I can apply some of the points you made to my own success. So thank you for writing such a fascinating book and if you read this thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to my opinions, and I hope to read some of your other books in my future because I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",0
2897,"so it's always great to find a good price. This book was also part of my son's summer reading, so it's always great to find a good price.",2
2898,Gladwell scores again. I'm always up for Malcolm Gladwell's work. He takes complex global concepts and distills them down into useful ideas to enhance our day-to-day lives.,2
2899,I love Gladwell.. My favorite of all the Gladwell books that I have read.,2
2900,Four Stars. Not bad,1
2901,Very well written. Trying to find an applicable lesson.. This is a great book to read. The stories are very well detailed and easy to follow. The main message is that some are more successful because of their situation. I'm trying to find what this means to me though.,1
2902,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck. It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary. For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced. Based on your astrological sign! That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older. And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference. That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children. Is that fair? No. It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up. Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year. That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2
2903,One of the hundreds of similar books. Another book is written using the same formula.,0
2904,"Good Value. Ship Faster and the book looks like a new. Just cover edge little bit bent, inside was good. Good value",2
2905,"Couldn't put it down. An easy, but thought provoking read. I will never look at US education and arbitrary entry to scholastic and athletic endeavors the same way.",2
2906,Don't think I'd necessarily recommend it to anyone. It's an okay book with some interesting facts. Don't think I'd necessarily recommend it to anyone.,0
2907,"Good start, blah finish. I thought the start of the book was pretty neat...hockey players getting an advantage because of their birthdays, entrepreneurs who benefited tremendously from external circumstance, etc was a good story. And he applies it to a larger social message that since increased opportunities are what help cause these positive outliers we should focus on providing as many opportunities as possible. He kind of lost me in the second half of the book though. I'm not from the South but some of that was borderline offensive. And while the stats may show Asian students are better at math, I'm not convinced that patience with rice paddies is really the reason.",0
2908,Good Read. Good Read.,2
2909,"Five Stars. I like the way Malcolm writes, so of course I love it!! Shipping was prompt!",2
2910,Average. Interesting but nothing special really. I would not recommend buying it. Starts off good and just goes downhill and gets a little depressing when it delves into airline crashes for a while.,0
2911,"Why are some people successful and others are not?. This highly readable books examines the roots of success, and debunks a lot of common misperceptions. The examples are fascinating, particularly the research done on the ""best"" athletes in Canadian hockey.<br /><br />The basic point from this book is that the best are not always the most successful. Generally, people get to be successful at something as a result of circumstances which in several example has to do with the timing of a person's birth.<br /><br />""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.""",1
2912,"Some interesting ideas but nothing that hasn't been said before. I bought the book because it's GlDwell's bestselling work. I was a bit disappointed. His theories are actually fairly mundane and very often, he is repeating what has already been said before. The book lacks the insight that I was looking for. A mild disappointment.",0

2918,Outliers: The Story of Success. I liked Tipping Point better. Outliers is an interesting concept but some of the stories of outliers seemed contrived. Gladwell includes his own family story in the concluding chapter.,0
2919,"the disappearing book. I was enjoying the book until it disappeared from my kindle. I was only half way into it. Tried to reinstall with no luck. Contacted Amazon and they reinstalled it, but with in three days it was gone again. I can't really give it a fair review.",0
2920,Not my cup of tea. I thought it was boring. Author jumped around to much before completing one subject. Was difficult to follow. I would not recommend for general reading.,0
2921,"An important book. This is not just a good book. This is an important book. One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.",2
2922,Very interesting concept. First couple of chapters are critical to understand the concept and the idea behind. Then is comes too descriptive in my view. Last three chapters were those I enjoyed the most. The book definitely arise some questions and debate. Very worth “reading”,1
2923,Five Stars. Quick delivery and a great book to read.,2
2924,"Great Book!. The book is awesome! It's something that helps me get through a tough day. If I come home from work and having a bad day, I flip to the chapter about crime scene cleaner and my day just turned brighter.",1
2925,"The Myth of Productivity. Gladwell points out some very important factors to increase productivity as a laborer and to be more competitive in an economy that favors employers: Education, Hard Work, Funding, Connections and a little luck. These are especially important in a declining economy, but their importance is attenuated in a growing economy. As demand for laborers exceeds the labor supply, opportunity is created for everyone, not just the most productive and competitive. This is the fundamental point that Gladwell does not understand. He never asks the important questions: What is causing the demand for labor to decrease? What is causing a reduction in the supply of jobs? What is causing economic decline? Why don't we change what is causing demand for labor to decrease instead of increasing the labor supply? And this is my ""genuine misgiving"" with Gladwell's ""glorious misconception."" Still, the reality is that the economy is in decline and laborers will have to become more competitive in order to gain the diminishing number of jobs available in the market. I think Gladwell does a good job providing psycho-analytical reasons for accepting and persisting in the grind of life as it becomes more grueling and for accepting failure as the result of bad luck. More capital consumption in order to grow and make more competitive the labor supply is not a long term solution. Increasing the labor pool does not equate to increasing the job pool. It is not opportunity in real terms.",0
2926,"A Star Is Born--Literally!. Genius may not be enough. In Outliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell credits success to coincidence and timing. How close in age were the Founding Fathers? What technological wizards were contemporaries in age? Which award-winning athletes are born in the first few months of a calendar year? And why does this matter? These are among the questions that Gladwell raises (and answers) to account for success. As with all Gladwell's Best Sellers, his premises are thoughtful and thought-provoking.",2
2927,Five Stars. Looking forward to this read!,2
2928,"Interesting pop science book - not scientfic, but is interesting. I thought this was a fascinating look into stories of success. What's key to notice is that although Malcolm Gladwell claims, or at least suggests, that he's looking at things scientifically, what he's really doing is telling stories. For instance, he doesn't really pin down what he means by success in the book, which makes the whole thing a bit tricky.",1
2929,"THE OUTLIERS. The book on cd is very interesting non fiction. I wish I had read it when I was raising children. I am not convinced that the conclusions the author makes are all that objective and scientific, but still they sound plausible.I am only half way through the book at this time.",1
2930,This is such a great book. I had to read it for a .... This is such a great book. I had to read it for a class but I enjoyed it tremendously. Gladwell has a very out of the box unique perspective on things. When you read is correlations to cause your just like wow. He leaves you floored. I've heard of his other works and I'm told they have a very similar approach.,2
2931,More than Horatio Algerish. This is a really good book.,2
2932,Fascinating. Great book,2
2933,"This book will change the way you think. Chapter by chapter, I was fascinated by the observations and patterns in this book. I couldn't get through it fast enough. If you want to challenge the way you think, this is more than a worthy read. It takes our notions of success and turns them upside down on its' head.",2
2934,Stunning. To say that it cleared away with myths is the least I can say.Gladwell's outliers did much more for me.His mention of the 10000 rule and examples strengthened my resolve to excel in my chosen field,2
2935,Five Stars. Be inspired and read this book.,2
2936,Great insight. Definitely worthwhile. The book explores the underlying reasons that some people are able to become great successes. Everything from Bill Gates to the impact of summer vacation on poor students. This is my favorite book of '12.,2
2937,"The good and the bad. Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.",0
2938,Successful peopl are not self made men. Following The Tipping Point and Blink - another thought provoking book by Malcolm Gladwell told by human stories - but carefully researched.,2
2939,"Beautifully Written. Makes one think about life differently and in effect, challenges the long held narrative that doing well i.e. winning in life is just a product of an individual's hard work . Outliers reminds us that culture, lineage, timing, and luck all factor into whether success is an outcome.",2
2940,No one makes it alone.. Outliers is the first Malcolm Gladwell book I have read and I can honestly say if the others are half as good then I am looking forward to all of them.,2
2941,"Brilliant. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwells 'revisionist history' podcast I decided to give outliers a go, and it didn't disappoint, I can't recommend it highly enough",2
2942,Inspirational. I really enjoyed this book and will purchase all Malcolm Gladwell's literary work.,2
2943,GREAT BOOK.. Malcolm Gladwell has a unique way of looking at situations. GREAT BOOK.,2
2944,"Entertaining and provides some food for thought, but don't take it too seriously. Some of the reviews here are as if not more interesting than the book itself! Mr Gladwell's Outliers is an interesting read to be sure. It is my first Kindle purchase and I read it in one night, so it is neither long nor difficult to digest in a short amount of time.",1
2945,Not a fan. Didn’t like this book at all. Just a bunch of stories about people……. Thought it would inspire me but I couldn’t even finish this book,0
2946,Demystifies greatness. It shows why people in history achieved what they achieved,2
2947,Good short read!. Interesting take on success and opportunities. I particularity liked the take on cultures and different work ethics. Good holiday read for sure!,1
2948,"How to make your kid exceptional, lots of right place right time.. This a good read for new and old parents. I read it more like and opinion peace, and it didnt take long to finish, but it does show you areas of life that you can give you child advantages that you may not see without reading this book.",2
2949,"Inspiring Illustrations. Obviously Gladwell is a great writer. He is fully gifted at turning dry data over the good storytelling. With inspiring illustrations of interesting research I found kinship with some interesting people, even if I fall short of their greatness. At least there is reason not to always comply with the status quo.",2
2950,"Discovering the amazing background to peoples' successes.. This book helped me gain perspective on inter-cultural I have had over the past 1/2 century. I wish I had known this outlook, perspective when lived overseas. I recommend it to all individuals/couples who are living and working in the developing World.",2
2951,Malcolm Gladwell. A very deep book with much meaning that could be of use in the past,2
2952,"Disappointed. I ordered 'Outliers', but instead I got 'A Dummies Guide to Vegan Living'.",0
2953,Outstanding. Reads like a novel but packs a great deal of sociological theory and facts. Worth revisiting every few years. A,1
2954,"A revelation. In short, I loved it. I considered it a revelation on the ways and means to success. I have seen the truth of his words in my own life. I do my best to instill his principles into the minds of my children. I share his findings with everyone I meet who desires to climb the ladder. Please, read it and live it (as much as you have opportunity to do so). If you are the 99 (as I was) and desire to be part of the 1, this book is indispensable.",2
2955,Outliers. It was recommended to me by a friend. It gives a interesting perspective into why some people are successful but is a real broad interpertation of successful people. Nice read though.,0
2956,A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,1
2957,"Cherry-picking. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
2958,"If you've read The Tipping Point, buy this!. Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer, explaining the unpredictable and unexpected! His clear writing style makes this a quick read, and gives you lots to think about. A great follow up to the first book. I'm hooked.",2
2959,just read it. Just read this book and you will understand why it is great. Very informative and unbiased in every way. Brilliant.,1
2960,"Kept me interested from start to finish.. Interesting book, but in spite of the research it is hard to believe.",1
2961,Gives other explanations why some are successful while others are not.. Purchased this book a couple of months ago as a new supervisor. Outliers met my expectations by explaining why some folks are successful while others are not.,1
2962,"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",2
2963,Thank you. Awesome!,2
2964,Excellent book which encouraged me to read a series of books by this author.. The story of what makes some people great. The inspiration comes to me from the point of view there are ingredients that go into greatness that are not necessarily exclusive to great people.,2
2965,"This book is fantastic. I am a big fan of business literature and have read books by authors such as Jim Collins, Dale Carnegie and more.",2
2966,"A combination of both. The author leans heavily on circumstance as the only creator of outliers and while I certainly understand his point of view, the efforts of the individuals to identify and act upon opportunity when it was presented seemed equally important and in some cases more so. You could sum up the whole argument as a chicken and the egg scenario and in the end, both were required to create and outlier or chicken.",0
2967,Four Stars. A great book well worth a read.,1
2968,An insightful and intelligent book. There is a reason behind any trend and phenomenon. Gladwell did his home work and rationalize them for us. A very enlightening book to read.,1

2970,"""Outliers"". Without question the most interesting book I have .... ""Outliers"". Without question the most interesting book I have ever read (and I am in my seventies). Gladwell gave me inf. that I didn't know existed. Who would have thought that Korean airlines crashes was due to the culture that the flight crew grew up in. Or why did the Hatfields &McCoys, and other similar geographic clans, react the way they did. I am now reading ""What The Dog Saw"".",2
2971,"A book. that every student should read. I first read this book some years ago and was most impressed. These ideas are not new but laid out in the manner of this book brings a new urgency to the teaching of our children.. Even MENSA has published an article that """"grit"" is as important as brain power. I have given a copy to my grandson as he leaves for university shortly in the hope that it will inspire him to work as did, say,Bill Gates. This is an excellent book and well worth the read for anyone with aspirations of improvement for self or others. Maybe it should be HS senior mandatory reading.",2
2972,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",0
2973,"Interesting Perspective. I don't agree with everything he says, but a very interesting perspective with interesting research. Well-written and so an easy read.",1
2974,"Great intro to Gladwell. Gladwell is brilliant, thoughtful and informative. Just a great perspective. Ready to dig into the next book right away must read",2
2975,Four Stars. Read this in college and loved it so got a copy for my son. Great read.,1
2976,"Interesting look at environmental factors in success. Interesting book, especially when read in connection with Mlodinov's ""Drunkard's Walk."" I'm not sure about the author's conclusions regarding education, but found his thesis regarding environmental factors as an influence on success as quite convincing.",1
2977,"Good inspiration for hard work and honest communication. Enjoyed the book, a fun quick read, about 1-2 days worth. My criticism is that Gladwell makes some sensationalized stretches of logic (Asians are good at math because their ancestors worked in rice paddies), when his smaller claims can be just as powerful (students are good at math because they work hard).",1
2978,"A must. Love Malcom Gladwell books , very easy to read",2
2979,but it's good to encourage thinking. interesting,2
2980,Five Stars. Amazing book revealing truths we often miss. Very insightful,2
2981,"Starts off fascinating, finishes off kinda weak.. The first half of the book was very intriguing. Following the path of some of the most successful people in the world to see how it happened is very interesting. i could have just read 100 more of these stories. While reading it I started to think about every time I achieved success, and all of the variables I had no control over that helped lead to that success.",0
2982,Good book. Good book. Very happy with this.,2
2983,Good read. Great read,2
2984,Awesome!. I really enjoyed the examples of real life outliers and the explanations of their success. Plain straight forward language that is easy reading and enjoyable.,2
2985,You just can't put it down. It is impossible for me to understand why this fascinating information did not come to light years ago. The writing was on the wall and much of the data was out there. I guess it took Gladwell's inquisitive mind and his arresting writing style to make it real for the rest of us.,2
2986,not cohesive. the story is somewhat scattered ... I would stop reading for a day and come back to it thinking i was reading another book.,0
2987,"Enlightened.. I was enlightened by the stories on the book. Great read, will look for other works by the author.",1
2988,"Greatly Recommended-Read it for my college class!. The book Outliers, written by Malcolm Gladwell, flew off the bookstore shelves and made its way into the hands of many Americans. This is an eye-opening book that captivated and fascinated the minds of many readers. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, used his years of research and ingenious tone of conversation to shed some light onto concepts about success that people believe every day.  His main focus of the book is to describe how certain circumstances, timing, ethnicity/culture and work ethic make a person a successful outlier. He challenges every day thoughts of many people in believing how a person can achieve success. Gladwell basically says, here is the research and it keeps pointing back to the same conclusion. There are many more factors that contribute to success then meet the eyes. Gladwell uses many examples and scenarios to support his main arguments about why achieving success is such a complex process. As a reader, you are almost guaranteed to find a section of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book that will catch your attention. Few of the variety topics he talks about in Outliers are hockey, schooling, airplanes and computer programmers. These topics just barely scratch the surface of this revealing book. In the book, Gladwell has a writing style of telling a story and then evaluating and dissecting the story with a much closer look. It is really fascinating about how all Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s concepts intertwine and make clear the once blurry image of success. After reading this book, my overall opinion is that I encourage you to give it a try. I would recommend this book to a reader who would like to learn the truth behind success or anyone who has a fascination with sucess. You might never know, the book Outliers could be used as a tool to help you reach your successful goal.",1
2989,"so worth the read!. An amazing book that really makes you think. Buy it and read it now, trust me you wont regret your move!",2
2990,"Good book. This book provides great examples and a unique perspective on how pioneers are created. The book goes through different scenarios and shows how either hard work, luck, or a faulty system can influence the outcome.",1
2991,"Misplaced Expectations -- Negative, Rambling, Random, Unscientific. I came in from reading Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, expecting scientific, statistically backed, thoughtfully reasoned bite-sized chunks of knowledge.

2992,"School Required Reading. My daughter likes the book better than she thought she would, but it is a slower read than she is used to and there are a lot of ideas and concepts to ""digest"". Her father and I plan to read it as we like Malcom Gladwell and have one of his other books as well.",1
2993,Very satisfying!. This was my first book to read from Malcolm Gladwell. I finished it months ago and I am still thinking about the information as well as talking about the book to really anyone who will listen. Wonderful.,2
2994,good factual book..... .....based on research and facts about why people are successful. The facts endorse that it is circumstances taht make you succesfull...,1

2998,Nice. Interesting book,1
2999,One Star. This book was sold as new. You can't make this stuff up. See the pictures.,0
3000,"Something to think about. It is a factual book so you need to be in that frame of mind when you pick it up. It has a lot of interesting ideas, however there were times when I considered the information obvious when Gladwell was trying to deliver it as a revelation. He has a good style of mixing the statistical data he is trying to get across with light anecdotes and case studies.",0
3001,"Great parenting resource & life book. Great book. I recommend it to my classroom parents, and have placed it on my classroom library lending shelf (for parents).",2
3002,malcolm will always get you thinking. Very nteresting to think that the month you were born can have effects more than you would at first presume.,1
3003,"When opportunity meets hard work. Glad well does a good job of dispelling the myth of a lone success. He more accurately depicts the opportunities that were unique in time and the individuals who recognized and took advantage of what was made available. That is to say, they worked like crazy. A good read that I found very encouraging.",1
3004,"Amazing insight into the sum total of factors that make successful people successful. This book puts it for all to see that success is not only a result of individual effort, but the sum total of many factors that make it impossible for a person to be a self made success. It helps understand how we can clone many more Bill Gates, Steve Jobs from first principles (what really made them successes). It's almost like the reverse engineering of success. Finding out the process from the product. It's one of my best reads ever!",2
3005,"Typical leftist propaganda. I was very interested to hear about the circumstances that lead to great achievement but what I didn't expect was to hear ( at the end of the book during the interview with the author) that this is more about leftist liberal ideology than scientific research. I think this may have been where Barack Obama came up with the statement ""you didn't build that"". I agree that conditions need to be right for people to achieve greatness but I completely disagree with the premise that these individuals weren't special. It's like a seed being planted on good ground or bad ground. If you're a mediocre seed in good ground you won't turn into much but the occasional special seed can become a mighty Redwood. To say that Redwood only became great because it was is the right soil completely ignores the spectacular strength and ability that's part of it's exceptionalism. To ignore that is extremely short-sighted.",0
3006,"The Outliers. I do not normally read books that are not history novel, i like to feel that by enjoying the reading i am learning some history as well. This book is not that different because somehow explains certain things about history and facts. Really good book! It helps to break some paradigms, i would recommend it to everyone who likes to dream.",2
3007,Informative. good read tells a lot about how no one is a self made man with out help,1
3008,Some particular aspects of stathistics. The outliers are aspects of the life of every day those in a particular moment become important for some motive.,1
3009,"Broad Applications. This is a well-researched book. Gladwell does a great job of plugging the issue of chance into the formula of success. However, I would have liked to see more examples that do not fit each of his arguments, as surely they exist. It would have created a more compelling and fortified point to show why these possible ""outliers"" did not attain the status that Gladwell's Outliers achieved.",1
3010,Extraordinary. Every chapter should be read. Each one reveals interesting stories built from dissecting facts and discovering true causes.,2

Extremely informative -- as a Canadian, I now plan on having my kids in the first few months of the year (you'll understand once you've read the book). Empowers you to feel that you too can be great. Gladwell himself narrates the book and his voice is clear and soothing. A definite recommendation to friends.",1
3014,Interesting concepts. Great for students or parents. Common ideas that people generally ignore. Enjoyable read. I read this book in one sit.,1
3015,Good read. Mildly used and great read,2
3016,the outliers. the first half of the book is great. then the science falls apart. and the wrighters personal opions begin to take over. ie. the intire last chapter is about his mom. lame... the book Talent is Overrated is much better from begining to end.,0

3018,👍. Thank you,2
3019,"Five Stars. This was a very enjoyable and informative book. Not only does this detail some methods of thinking that are outside of the box and beneficial to the reader, but it also going a long way to help inspire you to overcome difficulties in your own life. While this is coming from a motivational book and speech lover, I believe that everyone could benefit by reading this book. It is my hope to teach classes one day, and this is one book that I would definitely like to bring into the classroom. I feel that students and adults alike will gain from reading. Well worth the money.",2

3022,quality. Good stuff,0
3023,"Great, quick read.. What a way to put success into perspective! This book points out what success looks like and what serendipity looks like. Little life lessons presented in an easy, readable format. Great for anyone with a toddler going off to pre-school to a teenager going off to college. This is not a self-help book. Instead, it is a book of anecdotes that, when put together, illustrate what some successful people have in common.",2
3024,"Why you are the way you are. A facinating story about how various factors beyond any individuals control influence their success. While some of the theories made a great deal of sense, especially those related to athletic success, others, in my mind were somewhat far fetched.

3030,"Great and Inflective Book, Engaging and Interesting Scenarios. Great book by Malcom Gladwell. A point-by-point summary:",2
3031,Opportunities and luck is more important than high Iq and intelligence. A true eye opener that makes us look at success differently. It makes us challenge success stories we hear and to dig deeper for the real cause of the success. Malcolm argues that it many times are a series of lucky events or opportunities rather than high Iq and intelligence that lies behind someone's success or superiority.,2
3032,Vyicvycyk. Gghj,0
3033,Bad book. He makes shallow arguments that are repetitive and unproductive. I do not recommend reading unless you are entertained by his writing.,0
3034,worth the listen if you like social science. fascinating series of stories that essentially state your circumstance + opportunities to practice are what make for outstanding examples of human performance. Gladwell does a great job presenting here.,1

3036,"Great book, terrible condition.. This book is awesome, definitely recommend. I already own a copy but bought this one used. It was advertised as used but in good condition. This book is creased, dirty, and just overall in bad shape. Not as advertised, and quite a disappointment.",0

3041,"Perspective Changing. This book changed my way of perceiving the achievent of sucess and how talent is less important than we think for reaching it. Gladwell picked great and interesting examples to prove his argument. It's a delightful book and I'll surely recommend it to my friends, especially for the ones who are about to be parents. ""The 10000 hours rule"" made me think how important pratice and nurturing is important when you are raising your kid.",2

You can tell a lot of research has gone into this book - it's full of stories that you want to retell! The book arrived on time and there were no issues with the seller, would buy from them again.",2
3044,"Good quality book. Not so fun to read.. It wasn't that great of a book to read, but it was required for me to read. However the book came on time, and it was in good condition. It smelled a little weird, but almost every paperback book does.",2
3045,"A true Masterpiece. So hardwork alone doesn't make one a success, there are other things, like luck, that plays into...I could of told you that, but not so masterfully!...The author builds his cases for his claims in this book like a master lawyer does in his courtroom. This book is art, a true masterpiece where every reader will be blessed differently for taking the short amount of time it takes to get through it. A must read for all that have ever ventured after their goals and have fallen short, for sure...Maybe, just maybe, it wasn't completely your fault.",2
3046,"Interesting. I enjoyed much of this book, but I sometimes felt that Gladwell cherrypicked his examples to fit his thesis and contorted others for the same purpose.",1
3047,"can be written in an easier way!. I think the concept behind this book is great,however stories were written in a complicated way! Would be better if stories were shorter.",0
3048,Great Book. The condition said new and it absolutely is. Great book and I highly recommend reading it if you are thinking about it. Quick shipment and cheaper than the stores.,2
3049,"Framing success differently. Gladwell succeeds in framing success a new way with this book, going ""behind the scenes"" and looking at factors that we wouldn't normally look at as predictors of success.",1
3050,"Not really a personal memoir, but... On a scale of 0-10, 0 being a personal memoir, 10 being a universally accepted theory.",1

3052,"Far from the best book I've ever read, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Long story short:",1
3053,"A creative, thought provoking and important look at success. I've become a fan of Gladwell's from his other books and this one takes the cake. It is a very creative look at what makes success in some very different fields. When you take the time to read through this, and it does take some patience, you'll get your bubble broke on what we generally thinks makes one successful.",1
3054,Original and out-of-the-box view of something that most poeple simply take for granted. Educational!!. Books like Outliers shake and open our minds. Malcom Gladwell not only opens deep questions about the way we have totally accepted the common path to success in our society today (in any society in the western world) but he also supports his groundbraking views with facinating data and analysis.,1
3055,Outliers. I liked the first chapter and then it all became a bit repetitive. I enjoyed the author's writing style and compliment him on his research.,0
3056,"A great literary experience.. Outliers is a book centered around the statistical aspects of the lives of successful people. The author gives evidence of how certain factors contribute largely towards success in life. He gives examples of how the month of birth of ice hockey players affect their chances of becoming professional atheletes, how the year of birth affected Bill Gates' childhood and learning environment which ultimately played a key role in his success. The author mentions the 10,000 hour rule, which claims tha...",1
3057,"meh.. An easy read by Gladwell, recognizing that no human is self made, particularly no ""genius."" Culture, luck, heritage and class all play a role in successes and failures.",0
3058,"Fascinating theories. This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make ""greats"" great. The stories are fascinating, and worth a read. Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end. That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off. I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.",1
3059,"Wow, interesting.. Malcolm Gladwell 's book is a fascinating collection of root causes. There are a multitude of answers to questions that I had never thought to ask. Malcolm Gladwell explores the roots of success to a depth that I never would have considered without provocation. I really enjoyed this book. I look forward to enjoying many new aha moments as I read the other books written by Mr. Gladwell. I had selected this book in hopes of discovering some recipe that I might employ to foster the interests of my children. I had hoped to discover the formula for helping to cultivate/ foster their ultimate success. This book did a great deal to inform my thinking. I do hope for a perfect storm of unique opportunities for each of them, but my strongest hope still remains their ultimate health and happiness. Thank you, Mr. Gladwell for the heaping mouthful of food for thought.",1
3060,It didn’t seem like I was going to be as interested as I .... Have you ever wondered what takes to become the “World’s Greatest” at something? What it takes to go from rags to riches? How much talent or determination you need?,2
3061,Quirky. Revealing. Insightful.. OUTLIERS is the third book which slices the world view in a slightly different way.,1
3062,what makes you outlier. First few chapters are good and clearly define outliers.,0
3063,Five Stars. Useful book. A lot of things to learn from this book.,2
3064,"Fascinating. I loved this book. At first there appear to be lots of statistics and facts but this quickly emerges as an overall theme which underpins the development of understanding generally, the ingredients which can lead to success.",2
3065,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",1
3066,Different perspective. This is a very interesting book that presents a different perspective on success. It looks at how a person's birthdate has an impact on their success. He presents sports examples as well as business examples. Also explorers cultural impact on success.,1

3068,"Pop Culture Outsights. Likes to engage is data mining approach to make his arguments, and just wanted to espouse his view on how interactions with the environment and cultures should work. Talent is talent and his view is so what - more effort will get near equivalent result. Bunk, my becoming the next MJ isn't happening. Devoted a significant portion of his work to promoting year-around school, and avoided the obvious problem with underachievers - the lack of parental ability and responsibility for upbringing and any thoughts on how to address this issue.",0

3072,Excellent Conclusions. We all like to think that people who make it as the ideal in their respective field are somehow special. They are... just in ways we didn't think. This book does a great job in illustrating patterns in society and the villages that raise our children and ultimately our outliers.,1
3073,"When were you born?. Well written, thought provoking book. A very good read.",1
3074,"Extremely inspiring! This book offers an alternative perspective on the requirement for success. 'Outliers' is really a masterpiece. It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",1
3075,"What's an outlier, anyway?. I am glad I ordered this bestseller. After reading BLINK, I was hoping that this work of Gladwell's wouldn't be as dry and difficult to read. It definitely wasn't. I learned the meaning of an outlier - never heard the term before - and agreed with some of his theories of family influence and opportunities knocking. However, I disagreed with others, such as the oldest children in a class having the most lead time in growth, hence athletic abilty, agility, intellectual development. As the mother of two sons who played professional baseball, I cannot attest to the latter theory, since it would apply to one son with an early birthday, but not to his brother, who advanced in the professional leagues well beyond his older brother and had a much later birthday.",1
3076,"New Perspective on Success. Outliers provides a highly unusual perspective to the causes of success. He studies patterns and statistics to support his argument that success is more than just talent and intelligence, but cultural upbringing, opportunity, and even simply being born in the right month of the right year. This book is relevant to people of all ages, and explains the very curious trends in certain success stories. Reading this book allows readers to understand the root of all success in order to come a step closer to attaining it.",1
3077,"Great Read - Helps Us Realize We Have Much To Learn. This is a great exercise in taking a handful of topics to illustrate how reality varies greatly from common paradigms. It helped me realize that many of the decisions made by individuals and institutions are based on incomplete or faulty perceptions of what is really happening. It is also humbling to recognize that much of success is better explained by chance or circumstance than by the illusion of the ""self made man"". All of this is written in a style easy to read. I've recommended this book to many friends. You might also enjoy ""You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself"" by David McRaney (Oct 27, 2011)",2
3078,"pretty straight forward. Nothing mind blowing here, but some interesting historical facts about those who have succeeded. Quick read if you are curious about Gladwell.",0
3079,"This is the truth about success. This book will turn your perceptions about what success means on their head. You will learn the truth behind the circumstances and actions of those who do better than everyone else. Most importantly, how all of this applies to your own life.",2
3080,"Human connectivity, interrelationships are key to meaningful lives. One of my past pupils recommended that I read this study in June 2018. I picked it up from Amazon and began to read it on a journey to San Antonio, and completed it on the return trip to Berkeley.",2
3081,Good purchase. Good quality. Good price.,2
3082,Ingredients for success. A powerful sociological writer who uses extensive research to come up with some challenging theories on human behaviour.,1
3083,Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to .... Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?,2
3084,Jaw dropping. Those in a position of success will immediately be put into a position of humility. Superficially we all know our success is all owed to others at some level. This book draws the connection brightly.,2
3085,Good theory but poor writing. The book presents different but very convincing views towards things about success we thought we get used to and we thought we well understood. It makes me rethink what exactly makes a person succeed. That's a very good lesson to myself and also child raising.,1
3086,"Importance of Outliers!. Fantastic read, insightful, informative and made me want to read more from Gladwell! Highly recommended",2
3087,food for thought. Great read! Thought provoking.,2
3088,I enjoyed this book. Malcolm Gladwell narrates his book very well. They’re are many interesting points he makes that may change your perspective.,1
3089,"you may be able to better control and change them to foster success. Definitely changes your perspective on success by demystifying outliers and explaining the conditions and opportunities that lead them to where they are now. If you can identify these conditions in your life, you may be able to better control and change them to foster success.",2
3090,"Wife's book club reading. I have no idea about its worth. Even if it were for me, I probably wouldn't have read it in a couple of days. Why do they post these evaluations, on books, especially, so soon after delivery?",2
3091,"First-rank work by Gladwell again. This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress. Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book. Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.) There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground. Easily one of the most important books of the last 10 years, imho.",2
3092,Five Stars. Perfect,2
3093,"10,000 hour BS!. The basic premise of the book is that ""it takes 10,000 hours to become proficient"" at a skill. That's just patently false!. There are people that can memorize a book after having read it only ""once"" (Think ""Rain main""). There are people that can learn a new language (Lithuanian) in a couple of weeks (not 10,000 hours - Think Daniel Tammet). What annoys me is that some people now quote that FALSE STATEMENT as though it were gospel. It's NOT! Oh well, there are also other major errors in Gladwells books, but he IS entertaining. And it wouldn't hurt if he lost that ""absent minded professor"" look! He could tuck his shirt in (or leave it out). Not half-in half-out...before a giving a talk at TED. His dress looked totally planned . . . in a bad and manipulative way!",0
3094,"Not really Malcolm standard. This book reads more like trying to form some pattern within a collection of anectodes. The various stories make this book an interesting read, but somehow the explicit link to outliers is not found in some of them",0
3095,It started strongly then rambled a bit. The insights in the first part of the book about reasons for outliers were amazing but it probably would have been a better book if it had been shorter. Some of the later chapters weren’t as interesting.,1
3096,Four Stars. given as a gift and was well appreciated,1
3097,"Good read. This is a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to understand how the intellectual edges of society function, and to get a good dose of reality to dissipate the thought that everything in life is based solely on innate ability. Gladwell does well to pay tribute to the fundamental needs of ability, but also demonstrates how luck and timing play a significant role to unlock the abilities of those on the fringe that make the difference between world wide success and being just another Joe.",1
3098,A very interesting perspective and a lot of good detail and insights. A very interesting perspective and a lot of good detail and insights. Definitely worth the read. However I felt like there were a lot of oversimplifications and I would take everything you read here with a grain of salt.,1
3099,Fascinating read. Fascinating read - thoroughly recommend Malcolm Gladwell's books,2
3100,"outliers. Great book! It let you thinking about the reasons to accomplish success. Hard work and perseverance, that's all you need.",1
3101,"A poorly made argument. Outliers is somewhat of a bait and switch. Rather than being a simple book about the inner workings of the super-successful, it's mostly a tome about society.",0
3102,"Outliers was a great book that made me think about success in a wh .... Outliers was a great book that made me think about success in a whole new way. I really thought that the cliche story of success had some truth in it, but apparently I was wrong. According to reviews like Rebecca on Goodreads, who said, “My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis,” this theory of Gladwell’s is very true. My only criticism is the lack of female representation by Gladwell. Allie from Goodreads agrees with me, saying, “Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem.” But overall. I thought the book was quite enjoyable and would recommend.",1
3103,"great book. Great reading, It will widen your horizon and see things in different perspective.",2
3104,I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising account and very well researched. I like that he looked at things from a completely unique perspective. It certainly gave me some new ideas to think about. Putting a little more effort in studying and learning more about my profession is one of the things that I certainly took from this book. Sometimes all you need is a good book to remind us that we need to step up our game!,1
3105,"Don't waste your time or money. The story begins by eluding to possible ways where you (reader) might also become an ""Outlier"" but every example and story reverts to the same basic premise - ""You won't find greatness without advantages beyond your own merits"", ""those who were fortunate enough to be born in the months January, February, and March are the only ones who could achieve the Outlier status"", ""all advantages in life just HAPPEN to fall into place for the selected elite.""",0
3106,Brilliant!. An interesting account of some of the world greatest and those outliners that may be less known. The book was gripping from start to finish.,2
3107,Well worth the time.. This book far exceeded my expectations - even after having read Blink. Definitely makes you think about the world around in you in a different way. If you have kids you might find yourself frustrated by how we are implementing education and sport selection.,2
3108,"Interesting. This was a pretty interesting book. I don't agree with all of the reasoning, but it's an interesting theory.",0
3109,"Food for thought. Outliers is my book of the year so far. I know I'm late to the party, but it really made me think. I'd heard most of it's ideas before (partly because it's been so successful), but never expressed this clearly, and accessibly, and all together.",2
3110,"Awesome Book. This is a must read book and should be added to anyone's Library. This order was for the CD virsion, it was great to be able to listen to it while I was driving to work (fairly long drive time). I like talk radio but this was benifical time spent. I ended up buy the book to read as well and to put on my shelf for future reference.",2
3111,"Some interesting insights, but more proof needed. Gladwell has some very interesting insights into success and I must admit that it opened my eyes to the background of successful people. However, many of the relationships touted between success and social factors are correlative, I would have liked to see him expound further to elucidate the causal relationship.",0
3112,"Thought provoking and very interesting. Reading this book has lead to a lot of reflection about myself, how I view others, and how I want to raise my children. As a Christian, it has helped to affirm the fact that we have little to no control over what happens to us, and that every success we have in life should be attributed to God.",1
3113,"Very good read. Certainly an enlightening book. Gladwell's writing certainly suits his purpose, and after you finish the book you'll have a new perspective on ""great"" people.",1
3114,"On brand for Gladwe. Classic Gladwell. Mostly makes really compelling points. A couple of his arguments are a bit of a stretch. Does a great job of showing how historical, socioeconomic, and cultural context shape our abilities and opportunities. Worth the read.",1
3115,this is not at all in good condition; i am a good customer of worldbooks .... this is not at all in good condition ; i am a good customer of worldbooks and i have already purchased other books previously like Einestein :his life and Universe ; Courage: the Joy of Living Dangerously (Insights for a New Way of Living) .,0
3116,"Best Gladwell book. Best Gladwell book, this book made me bought 3 others from the same authors, disappointing compare to this one ! It changed the way I think (a bit)",2
3117,Good for conversation. I really liked this book and will use it for future conversations when there is a lull. It was not a book I could not put down but it was very interesting and gave new information.,1
3118,"LESS IS MORE. This book, as other books by this author is long. Not long as in many pages, but long as in goes on & on & on & on on topics that do not need to be dragged out. ""COME ON MAN, I GET THE POINT""",0

3121,I would recommend this book to any young person with a desire .... I would recommend this book to any young person with a desire to understand how the world at large spins. It kinds leaves the impression that success is a matter of luck. But it also motivates a person to exploit all possible advantages.,2
3122,I didn't like the book. I'm an outlier. I didn't like the book. The subjects of the book were privileged and had access to resources I never did as a child of a lower-middle-class family in the 80s. The book didn't make me feel better about having a higher-than-normal IQ. It just made me upset with how the privileged stay privileged and the lack of help/resources for geniuses of financially challenged families.,0
3123,"quick read. great insights. will change your life. i still make references to its 10,000 hours theory frequently. probably gladwell's best book and i have read tipping point, blink, and the one w the short stories. it's a quick read. well written and fun to read.",2
3124,"Right Place Right Time?. Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers reads as a provocative new interpretation of the foundations of success. As the reader pages through his numerous examples of seemingly heroic success stories who in fact owe their fortune and fame to circumstance, that reader is tempted to toss aside all previous assumptions about the roots of individual merit.",1
3125,"Worth Reading. I like Malcolm Gladwell, and this is probably his most applicable book -- it inspires and demonstrates his theories, rather than just explaining that they exist. I use it as a text in my AP Language class, and it is, by far, the kids' favorite read because it applies to their lives.",1
3126,Five Stars. Makes you think outside the box,2
3127,"A must read!. This book is so good! I love Malcolm Gladwell anyway but it's really interesting to read these stories. If you like the podcast Under The Influence (on the CBC), you'll love this book.",2
3128,"Must read!. Amazing book. LOVE. Top 5 favorite. Very fast read, lots of info, very informative!",2
3129,Outliers book. Loved the book. I sent extra one to 16-year-old grandson and he loved it too. Now we spent time on phone discussing book. Love it!,2
3130,Not For me!. just because it happened once it doesn't mean it must happen again . I don't believe that because your good at seeing and finding patterns you can predict the future.,0
3131,Challenged the Status quo. Are we where we are today because of personal achievement or circumstance? This author highlights the impact of circumstances or chance on success. While most books focus on personal achievement as a reason for success it is refreshing to see success from a different perspective. The author doesn't disregard personal skill but rather highlights that the outliers of our most successful became outliers due to equal parts luck and drive.,1
3132,"Outliers by Gladwell. This book sparked a very interesting discussion with a book group about the concept of an outlier. While Gladwell's information was interesting, it seemed to most of us to represent fairly common sense. However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it. Gladwell's book seemed narrow with respect to being almost exclusively American in nature and ignored so many that were in other places in the world and other times in history.",2
3133,"Great book, strongly recommeded. I strongly recommend this book, I spent only one weekend to read it all. There are plenty of facts and histories that make we think that no success happens by chance. The legitimate success is built with lots of effort, training, dedication, love and opportunities taken, of course. This is the kind of book you must read more than one time.",2
3134,"Selecting for Success, One Policy and Culture at a Time. I already was aware that many of the methods by which society selects for ""success"" are biased towards many under-represented groups. I just didn't realize how many groups were under-represented: culture, language and most surprisingly: birthday.",1

3140,The Differentitating Factor. This book gives us a new angle to look at life. It talks that the people who made big in life for them hard-work was one part and the second reason they succeeded is that they got the opportunity. Without the opportunity they would have never made it big.,1
3141,"Depressing, not inspiring. While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas. For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.",0
3142,"very interesting. A look behind the curtain of what helps to make some of the most successful people successful. This is not a book that tells you how to become successful, but instead looks at the reasons people became successful. some very interesting theories",1
3143,understanding Culture. This book does a great job describing culture and how things came to be that way. I loved the depth of research into history to explain why certain people are more successful than others.,1
3144,"Disappointment. I had higher expectations due to all the hype surrounding this book. The narrative is incoherent, he jumps from one topic to another in a seemingly random assortment of stories only to end with some sort of a anti-racism statement as conclusion.",0
3145,"A bit boring. I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book. To be honest it’s a bit boring and author goes around same subject again and again. We stoped reading midway through. I don’t know may be it is a matter of taste, but we didn’t like it.",0
3146,Did not meet my expectations. I've expected more from the book based on what people say about it.,0
3147,"Inspiration for those who appear to be out of step.. Gladwell is always a great read. His ability to take diverse stories and weave them into a form that supports his thesis is wonderful. Good stories, good premise. Thanks Malcolm.",1
3148,"Great concepts. Truly enjoyed this book, nice stories/examples from variety of cultures. Interesting theory on how successful people are actually have been made, and it will make you rethink how many factors are actually involved in “making it”. Timing/ethnicity/cultural environment etc. are detrimental to success, as much as hard work and perseverance.",1

3150,An excellent book. Highly recommend.. An excellent book. Highly recommend.,2
3151,Brilliant and Challenging. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell since The Tipping Point and this book is no exception. His study of education is the finest part of the book but every chapter is fascinating. His discussion of race and skin tone using his own genealogy is one of the bravest things I've ever read.,2
3152,"Love the stories and anecdotes.... Gladwell sounds very convincing, and his book is full of well told anecdotes, success stories, and what seems to be crucial statistics. However, it sometimes seems a bit of «cherry picking» when Gladwelltend to mostly tell us what fits his view. It’s not to be read as facts, but as something to be added to a much bigger debate. Gladwell mostly argues that opportunities and hard work are the main engredients to success. But he doesn’t really talk much about «grabbing» the opportunities that is in front of you, or creating opportunities out of what seems to not be one to others. He explores it a bit when talking about the different cultural glasses people view the world with, so not completely taking it away from him.",1
3153,"Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to. One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret. It means looking at ourselves, at work habits, our cultural legacy and asking ourselves some hard questions. Gladwell's thesis is inescapable and puts the responsibility on each of us to create a better world and a better self.",2

It made me see things that I've looked at a million times so differently! I really love his books and honestly, his writing is worth the trendy praise. It's a quick read and absolutely worth it.",2
3160,"Excellent read. I know the author is drawing some interesting characteristics together, but seems like when you were born has as much to do with ""success"" and opportunity as hard work and a good mind. Fascinating stories and comparisons.",2

3163,I skimmed this book instead of reading it. I didn’t entirely love it.,0
3164,"Seems anecdotal in nature, but don't be fooled, there is a theme there. Reading Malcolm Gladwell is like watching the PBS series ""Connections"". In both cases, the author (and the narrator) brings up several interesting but initially unconnected historical stories, and then ties them altogether at the end to show the advancement of a science or an ideology. Very interesting.",2
3165,interesting but overwhelming in mundane facts. It presented topics that benefit high society to understand why lower class people are at a disadvantage. The book was okay but not great. I could have gone without reading this long drawn out argument.,0

3169,"Some great thought provoking ideas but too much weight given to circumstance. Really good read, and the examples of outliers were well supported, but seems to give too much credence to the notion that success is mostly a matter of luck and circumstance. Recognizing the stream of opportunities that presented themselves to these very successful people, they still had to actually take advantage of them with hard work and all the rest. I wonder how many stories could be compiled of unsuccessful people that let extraordinary opportunities slip by.",1

3171,"I hesitate to give this even one star but I .... I hesitate to give this even one star but I am doing so because i think his point about how the factors of the time, the environment and the culture enable or harm one's ability to succeed. However the absence of women in his examples is just so glaring, that accompanied by his refusal to acknowledge the impact of racism, sexism and the discrimination every wave of immigrants to this country faced makes his work invalid.",0

3175,Great Book. Malcolm Gladwell provides us with unique and engaging insight into how people have reached notable success.,2
3176,"1st time Gladwell reader. Gladwell has a perfect grasp of statistical relevance. He is not quite as smart as Taleb, but then neither am I; LOL. You will find this book to be an easy and enjoyable read, and I especially recommend it for new parents. I have since purchased another book by this author.",2
3177,"Interesting Facts. The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful. In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",1
3178,One of the best!. Excellent tread! I had not thought of these reasons for success. Gladwells's writing style is enjoyable. Goes to show that timing and practice lead to proficiency in ones endeavors!,2
3179,"Another book by Gladwell. Naturally a similar writing style from ""Made to Stick"". It had it's catch all points. Nothing earth shattering, but easy reading",0
3180,a very enlightening book!. I would love my grown kids to read this book. It may assist them in making decisions about their children.,1

3185,"A fun easy read. Gladwell is an excellent writer who is able to combine facts and weave it into a story. I had read several of his books. However, this one was my personal favorite. The only real critical review of this book written by reviewers was that there are no women, I was not bothered by this as a female. It is not an overly intellectual read, more something to read quickly for fun.",1

3187,Ok book. This was much different than I expected. I can see some relevance but not all in on some of his assumptions.,0
3188,Forward Thinking!!. Never dull moment in these books. Malcolm Gladwell has a great way of tying together a bunch of stories to make his point that sometimes being way out there is the way to go!,2
3189,"Amazing. I started reading this and there were some great individual stories but didn't see where it was coming together. Mr. Gladwell is an amazing writer that I believe we do not have enough of. I believe this young man could write a book on watching paint dry and you would say that it was the best book written. Am now reading ""David and Goliath"".",2
3190,"I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",0
3191,"Excellent Book. Although I don't 100% agree with final conclusion, but this is an excellent book that explains many details about success that I have never thought about them.",1
3192,"Great points, but slow at times.. In typical Gladwell fashion, this book has the power to transform the way you think. His evidence is truly compelling and for the most part it's engaging. The one problem I had with this book was how many stories there were. He would start every chapter with a story--often a slow one, building up different characters and setting the stage, and then he would start another story, and another one. You would realize the points of the stories, but he wouldn't really spell it out for you until the chapter's end.",1
3193,"Good reading, well written, feels like a novel. It is a well written book, it feels like providing a frugal explanation why it is normal to be ordinary, that you should be blessed by a series of conjunctions and factors to be an outlier, which is fine in some sense, however the good flow of the text brings more joy to this book. So I Recommend it for both reasons!",2
3194,"Interesting theory. But example are dated. The but include interesting theory of success maining the opportunities individual has been given. But most examples are from early 20 century which are almost a hundred years old, which make me wonder if those trand is still there today. And the book didnt really give any conclusion to how to react to opportunity.",1

3199,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2
3200,"Brilliant read!. Outliers is in general for all who like to figure out why they are where they are. Its an interested take on everybody around us. Malcolm Gladwell has done well to attribute all successes to not a singular parameter but rather to a series of events and incidents that happen to come together to form a larger chain leading up to the ""success"".",1
3201,A must read for anyone under 25 or kids under 25.. I listened to this book and bought the print for my wife. This was one of the best if not the best non-fiction book I ever read.,2
3202,Very interesting and essential book. I was really lucky to hear about this book and I felt more lucky when I finished it 2 minutes ago.,2
3203,"Great Book. I only bought this book because my brother raved about it. What an interesting, informative and thought-provoking book it is. I love excellence and this books show the basic blueprint for achieving it.",1
3204,"Interesting, and Fun to Read (If Not Completely Earth-Shattering). I want this quote from Chapter 8 tattooed on my students’ foreheads: “Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds.” Nailed it. No better statement explains the difference between success and failure in my English and writing classes.",1
3205,"Biggest Pile of BS since The Secret. I 100% disagree with all the concusions made in this book, my personal life is a good example of how I made it in life to stay above the average and it is 100% opposite of what this BS of a book suggests.",0
3206,"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",2
3207,Great way to relate success to factual social conditions.. I liked the practical analysis of successful people stories.,1
3208,"quite longwinded and not telling stories that a person can use for their own success. This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'. It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies. I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",0
3209,Five Stars. Great book.,2
3210,"interesting. I enjoyed reading this book but I guess I didn't read the review or summary of the book very well. It really wan't what I expected. It was a good read, but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case. I didn't find the book inspirational, but at the same time, it kept my attention to the very end.",1
3211,"Great concepts. Totally different view of success as we know, very interesting read. Well written and easy to follow, the examples used really help tell a story.",2
3212,"Five Stars. I like the way Malcolm writes, so of course I love it!! Shipping was prompt!",2

I would take some of the conclusions with a grain of salt as statistics can be manipulated to prove just about anything. Required reading for my college daughters Sociology course. I read it when she was finished and pointed out some of the errors in making conclusions.,1
3216,"Another terrific book from Gladwell. ""Outliers"", like other Gladwell books, is very enjoyable. It offers some interesting perspectives about what makes some people more successful than others, with particular emphasis on those who far exceed expectations. Many of the book's criticisms focus on what the book is not. I think that is a mistake. This is simply a fine book, a very thoughtful and easy read. The book goes into how one's ethnic roots and specific opportunities set the stage for dramatic success, then working hard takes over. For example:",2
3217,"Great all around read. I really enjoy Mr. Gladwell's books. This books is no exception. Recommend it for anyone looking for a thought provoking, easy to read book.",1
3218,ANOTHER GLADWELL WINNER. Everyday assumptions challenged by logic and lengthy irrefutable statistics. Helps clear cobwebs from the brain and invites exploration in previously unknown fields of information.,0
3219,"Lack of a full tie-in. The stories through this book were great and very informative; however, the author only did a roughly 5 minute tie-in at the end of the book showing how all of the stories stated previously in the book come together. Instead of going into mass amounts of detail per story (although they were intriguing) I feel like there should’ve been more time devoted to describing what the book is about, rather than what the stories were about.",0
3220,... of the talented people in world simply got a good break and made the most of it. Interesting read and made me aware that so many of the talented people in world simply got a good break and made the most of it.,1
3221,"Believe it or Not. “No matter how talented you are, how hard you work and how much you practice, you can be successful only if you also have the right backing and luck.” This is a statement I have had heard from elders a thousand times over and this book statistically validates the point.",2
3222,Eye opener. It used real life very relatable examples to understand the main purpose of the book.,2
3223,"I enjoyed this book. Follow-up books can be tough. Like movie sequels, you can end up with a ""Grease 2"" or ""Caddyshack II"" at one end of the spectrum, to the ""Godfather"" series on the other. Happily, Outliers is closer to the good end of the spectrum, and in many ways, I enjoyed it more than ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"".",1
3224,"Interesting, well written and thought provoking.. It's one of those books where you keep telling people snippets of information (badly reproduced)",2
3225,Must read!. Great insight in how successful people have made it to where they are! This books steps away from the self made man and introduces factors that shapes a successful person. It will definitely open different point of views!,2
3226,An easy read. Really enjoyed this book,2
3227,Five Stars. Very interesting,2
3228,"Must read for any parent. I know that this is a business book and it does have good business references, but I actually found more value in reading it as the parent of two preschoolers. It causes you to think about the opportunities that you give your kids that will set them up for success. Great read!",2

3232,A different side of how we view success. -----The Good Stuff-----,1
3233,"Not worth reading. If this book were concise, it would be one chapter of about 15 pages. The remainder of the book is continuous regurgitation of ever-so-slightly different anecdotes with the names changed. A very tedious and hardly worthwhile read.",0
3234,"A must read!. This is the first book by Mr. Gladwell I have read. Now, I want them all! He has the ability to look at things from a ""different "" angle causing one to question why we do what we do....what makes us tick, and how that affects the next decision or event. I find myself thinking about the concepts he presented days and weeks after I read about them.",2
3235,"I especially like chapter one concerning birth order and opportunities and another .... I advise everyone to read this book. It is well written and very thought-provoking. The author shows that there is more than one way to look at things. As an educator, I especially like chapter one concerning birth order and opportunities and another chapter that explains a possibility of why orientals excel in math. Orientals have a different method of learning and doing math. I found the book fascinating.",2
3236,"Fascinating interpretation of success. Gladwell has an inviting style of writing. It's as though he's chatting with the reader, alone, over coffee. His unpretentious,natural manner is the antithesis of his extraordinary observations and insights. A great read .",2
3237,Interesting & thought provoking. Malcolm Gladwell presents an interesting take on the reasons behind the success of outliers who it has been assumed are just extremely independent individuals.,1
3238,One point valid beyond that he is reaching.. The point on the age and birth month in regards to childhood sports program is valid.,0
3239,"Excellent - It will make you think.. This book is different from the type of book I usually read but I really enjoyed the book. Outliers is a book about the reasons some people are successful in life or not successful. The date when a person is born, the 10,000 hour rule, Jewish lawyers and their success in the 70's and 80's, air plane pilots and the country in which they were born are all some of the outliers which the author discusses in full. What the book really does is make you look at your own life and wonder how your successes and failures are tied to things in which you had no control. I strongly urge everyone to read this book. It will keep your interest and make you think.",2
3240,"Interesting on some theories, but a bit stretched on .... Interesting on some theories, but a bit stretched on some topics, and sometimes looking for the dotted lines. The writing is very journalistic, could be improved in flow.",0
3241,"A few pearls, but not enough for a necklace. Gladwell lacks rigor (just run a google search for detailed criticism), but this book contains some interesting anecdotes (most memorably the relationship between birth dates and team selection in sports) and one important idea: focused, hard work breeds success.",0
3242,"A Different View of Success. I first heard about this book when Chris Rock referred to it on The Howard Stern Show. When Stern asked Rock what it took to be a great standup comic Rock replied, ""ten thousand mother f***ing hours."" Stern got the reference right away, saying ""Malcolm Gladwell right?"" and Chris Rock said, ""it's my bible."" I downloaded this to my kindle before the interview was over.",1
3243,"Interesting Ideas for an average reader. While Gladwell brings up interesting theories about our inheritances, he does not actually prove anything and thus the book is more entertaining than scientific.",0
3244,Five Stars. great book full of wonderful stories and infos,2
3245,"Inspiring but wrong. This is an entertaining (and somewhat convincing) book. However, when you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that most of Gladwell's work has been discredited by science and has no more bearing on Psychology than one's astrological sign.",0
3246,Two Stars. More scientific - like a manual - boring!,0
3247,"but it seems like depends on ""LUCK"". After reading this book, I had mixed feeling. I have opportunities that a society provides for all, but it seems like depends on ""LUCK"". If I were born in the last quarter of the year in Canada, I would not be a famous hockey player. By society - in determining who makes it and who does not. ""Grit"" and ""Do hard work"" might overcome it sometimes. I hope!!!!",2
3248,Four Stars. Very good insightful book. Will read again too,1
3249,"ok book.. Interesting stories for sure. But, it just seems seems to me that compared to ""the tipping point"" Gladwell's books are just not that good anymore. I've read blink and outliers after reading tipping point and they are just not that good in comparison.",0
3250,"Fascinating Information but Limited Self-Help. As many people at work were raving about this book I needed to read it for myself. I was a little reluctant at first because of some of the Amazon reviews saying that Gladwell culled information from a lot of studies and that the reader would be better served going to some of those studies themsleves. ladwell has done an excellent job of poring through mountains of data and presented many of these studies in a concise way that can be understood by any layman. Most of the information is presented in a logical and interesting progression. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it in the same way when I am flipping channels and I see something marvelous structure being built on a Discovery Channel show. hough the information is fascinating and I enjoyed reading most of the book, I wonder if this is really a ""self-help"" book or not. The first few chapters talk about how successful people are made. Having not been born in the first three months of the year, I already missed the first level of success. Not having 1,000 hours available to master something new, I missed the next idea. I was not born in the ideal years for success in the computer field (1952-1955) and my parents were not clothing makers in Eastern Europe.  was not born Asian so I will never have the mastery of math that someone that speaks and Asian language has from the time they started first learning numbers. Then the chapter on the likelihood of a crash based on ethnic background makes one be more frightened to fly on one of the airlines that may have a pilot and copilot from a ""class-laden"" country. I assume that the studies and new training methods have since reduced these risks. hat it all comes down to is that this is a fun read and I definately recommend the book because the reader will find most of it fascinating. But there is very little information that can be used for those that want a ""self-help"" manual to be successful.",1
3251,An Insight into the Puzzling Nature of Success. An insightful take on success. I particularly liked the multiple examples from different fields. The book kept me fully entertained on a long flight to San Francisco. Well worth the price!,2

3258,"Gives you a new perspective. Yes, the book gives you a new way to look at success; however, the most noteworyhy is the way he makes you revisit the way we (should) approach ""matters"", in general.",1
3259,"Fascinating, Fascinating, Fascinating. I read Malcolm Gladwell's ""BLINK - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking"" and enjoyed it very much!! I chose ""Outliers"" just to read something else by this author. I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one. I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered. Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception. I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe. I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later. You won't be sorry.",1
3260,Great read. Very interesting points. Well written and something to think about,2
3261,interesting but not enough. Interesting information but I got bored of it halfway through. Probably just not my cup of tea.,0
3262,Four Stars. good.,1
3263,"Enjoyable, Thought-provoking. My favorite of the Gladwell triumvirate.. Outliers is more observation than advice; as it should be, considering the case it's making. It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked. Similar to Tipping Point and Blink, Gladwell offers memorable anecdotes - himself obviously a student of his own ""sticky"" storytelling as defined in Tipping Point - packaging complex subject matter in distilled, memorable format for those of us making a living on something other than University Stipend.",1
3264,"not particularly helpful. The book is a collection of stories, which is fine, but it's hard for me to believe the examples provided are actually representative of the population at large. There is little to no practical advice about how to make your own ideas come to life.",0
3265,Outstanding. One of the best books I vac read in recent times. Very meticulous and up to the point.one has never really thought about success seriously until Mr.Gladwell points the indicator which are so scattered that it would have been impossible to fathom.,1
3266,"Stating the Obvious - Missing the Outliers. Since the publication of the ""Tipping Point"" I have used Gladwell's book in many of my lectures and required reading for graduate students. Yet just as I was delighted with that work, I was equally disappointed with ""Outliers."" His findings stated the obvious. Parental support combined with opportunity/chance provides the landscape for amazing success stories. Are these outliers or merely the results of strong parental support? Certainly culture, environment, and other variables combined play a role in success. It would seem that the true outliers would be those that came from lower income families. These families were concerned with economic survival that no time was available to support the educational needs of their children. When children from this background and despite the odds achieved success, they would truly be the outliers. From the perspective of ""Outliers"" we shouldn't waste any time whatsoever with them, they can't possibly succeed!",0
3267,Insightful analysis with many great examples. This book was recommended to me by one of my friends as a mind blowing experience and it was absolute true. This book allows putting many thoughts and pieces together to see a beautiful picture of success. I'd recommend this book to all the leaders and parents and probably would recommend a simplified version of it to be read and tought to all kids.,2
3268,"An interesting read.. Found it to be a very interesting read. Gladwell is an interesting guy himself. Really enjoyed it, and it's a quick read.",1
3269,"Gladwell fan and this is my favorite one.. I recommend this book for just about everyone. Intelligence and hard work are ingredients for success yet opportunity plays a tremendous role. Gladwell makes good sense, and his books are always a quick enjoyable read.",2
3270,"Outliers. This was a fascinating read. Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me. The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward. Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.",2
3271,"A read required to understand modern day prejudices. This book opens your eyes to the indirect causes that lead to outcomes that seem preordained. It will help anyone become more effective at reducing the biases that are being indoctrinated into us by today's media, education system, and social sites. It was worthwhile; short and sweet.",1
3272,Gladwell's Outliers. This is a must reading for teachers and parents. It suggests we challenge our kids but not necessarily try to imitate other culture's educational practices.,1
3273,"Fascinating!. The author takes a different approach to the subject and there are a lot of ""ah ha!"" moments. It's a fun and easy read for sure.",2
3274,Good book. I am late to the Gladwell game and I thought this book had some interesting points and observations to make.,1

3278,Four Stars. Good,1

3297,"Unconvincing and overly long.. I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",0

The section on pilot error really openend my eyes to what happens in the cockpit of commercial airplanes.

It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
3305,"Excellent read. This was the first book I have read from Malcolm Gladwell, I previewed a lot of it in a book store and found it fascinating. The main premise of the book is that the most successful are not successful only because of hard work, though that is part of it; they also tend to have had great luck in getting experience (or, more specifically, the opportunity to get a lot of practice). The examples he gives are fascinating and I fond quite a bit too highlight. As some of the reviews have said, it makes you think; mainly, obviously to look at success as dependent on circumstances, but also to realize that most people have the potential to be immensely successful, as long as they are in the right place at the right time, regardless of their IQ.",2
3306,"Five Stars. amazing read, everybody needs to read this book!",2

3308,Four Stars. Great book!,1
3309,Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,0
3310,"Interesting read, though flawed approach. I read this for a book club, and have never read any of his stuff before. That being said, it was an interesting read. I felt he had relevant points and research to back up his opinion (though there is research for every opinion). I agree with his overall point, which is nurture plays a larger role than nature. He takes a rather cynical approach though and rules out desire and the will to achieve something. Of course, the circumstances need to be right for something to happen, but I believe if you have the will you will find those circumstances. So read for the information, but take it with a grain of salt.",0

3313,"One of Best. I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",2
3314,"Quick, Fun and Thought-Provoking Read. Gladwell does it again! I read Tipping Point a number of years ago and picked this one up recognizing the same author. It's one of those cool books that give you a thought buzz for days. His unique pretension of success-connectivity is fascinating. As always, Gladwell supports his theories with very clever statistics which sometime outshine his proposals.",2
3315,"work harder and be a guy: the secret to success. Gladwell says that this book looks at the ways in which success is governed by the culture the succeedor comes from. But the overall impression one gets after reading the book is that it is a long argument for the value of hard work in certain limited fields. Yes, Gladwell does say that his ""outliers"" like Bill Gates and Bill Joy had extraordinary opportunities and luck that other people didn't have; but none of that opportunity and luck would have done them any good if they hadn't been willing to work very long hours at programming, in order to become the best programmers in the world. The same goes for hockey players and the Beatles and Chinese math students.",1

3318,"The Story of Other Peoples Success. Let me summarize for you: you need to have been born in a certain year to be successful. The end. Prob my fault, but I thought this was a self-hep book, rather it’s just a collection of stories of people who are successful because of the specific year they were born.",0
3319,Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,0

3324,"This is all common sense.. I enjoyed reading the stories in this book. It made me think. I suppose it does take more than 10,000 hours of practice to become a top notch musician or athlete or scholar. Success does take more than just brains and hard work. Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck. I agreed with everything in the book. It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control. Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against. That is unfair. As a wealthy society we lose out on great talent and ability when we don't give a chance to people who are different from us.",2

3332,interesting. nice read. interesting stories that come up with conclusions I would like to continue to look into myself. I feel like a bad person for saying that the epilogue about his family was the least interesting part of the book.,1
3333,"I cannot see myself giving Outliers anything less than 5 stars. Although Malcolm's writing can often become repetitive, I cannot see myself giving Outliers anything less than 5 stars. Although business-inclined folk might see this as a challenge to their tenets (hard work and talent = success), to me, it felt invigorating. It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work. It will tell you that the road to success is convoluted and sometimes hidden in plain sight. To me, it showed me that to be an Outlier, you have to keep your head up, practice constantly, and be able to recognize opportunities and seize them.",2

3338,"Think you did it on your own, well, think again. Insightful explanation of the circumstances that shape successful people. If you are inclined to think you did it all on your own, Gladwell will convince you that factors outside of your control played a big, very big part in your success.",2
3339,Interesting read. I really enjoyed reading this book - it is entertaining while delivering a well-woven study of the topic on the paths many examples have taken to becoming sucessful. Makes a person think of new ways to use some of the referenced opportunities to ones advantage (or at least recognize them where before it had not occured it was an opportunity).,2

3348,"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",2
3349,One Star. I'm finding this book tedious.,0
3350,"Thoughts worth considering. I enjoyed reading the book. It made me re-think how I perceive abilities to perform certain types of work. It also brings forth the idea that the most commonly help view of intelligence is was too simplistic and that we must consider emotion, social, and other forms of intelligence beyond logic or pattern recognition. Many times we put our own barriers in front of ourselves and take away opportunities to try new things because we think ""only someone like ___ could do that"".",1

3352,"Very Intriguing. Malcolm has covered every aspect of how its the external factors that also play a major contributing role towards the growth and success of successful individuals.This probaly should clear the misconception many people have that successful people do not have to work hard and do not have to face difficult situations in their lives.The end was very well summarised and almost brings a tear.Especially when you realise the hardships,sacrifices and pain that successful people have gone through or have to go through in order to become successful.",2

3355,Three Stars. Can't quite get into it? And it's an audio!,0
3356,"Best of His Work so Far. This was easily the best of Gladwell's work so far. It really gets at the concepts of what helps people succeed. And, to a large extent, success is not something one is born with. A person shapes their future and their success through a mix of talent and lots of hard work. As an educator, I quote this book heavily with both staff and students.",2
3357,Extraordinary. Every chapter should be read. Each one reveals interesting stories built from dissecting facts and discovering true causes.,2

3361,Fabulous - a real mind bender. I enjoyed this book enormously. Full of very interesting stats and studies that help you understand why some people can achieve so much. Some underling assumptions are successfully challenged. A book to bend the mind and make you reevaluate.,2

3363,Excellent condition. Speedy delivery. Interesting book. Thoughtful and well documented. Excellent condition. Speedy delivery. What else can I say?,2
3364,Disappointing. Very obvious. No great insights. Not worth the time to read or listen to. Of course people have different opportunities. Of course people perform differently. Of course intelligence is not the only criterion. Gladwell presents no good rationale and certainly no compelling case as to why some succeed and some do not. One of the most overrated books read,0
3365,"Paul Harvey on steroids. If you enjoyed Paul Harvey and the rest of the story, then you will like this. The author finds obscure people and situations then tells the rest of the story. However, when the author goes off on philosophical curiosities, then the story is destroyed. He copies the hockey story from Freakonomics and doesn't give credit. As far as me the reader/listener, I can draw my own curiosities. Thanks Gladwell for some good stories. Perfect for my boring commute.",0
3366,"Good read. A good read , gets you excited to work hard. I enjoyed it more than blink by Malcolm Gladwell. The last 2 chapters were a bit boring thought",1
3367,"Intriguing. I found this book to be very informational and made me think differently about success and how it is achieved. The book includes valid sources, Gladwell’s unique writing style, and use of demographic evidence to support his claims about success. He uses examples from many different countries and categories such as Korean pilots, American entrepreneurs, and Jamaican women to name a few. I would recommend this book to those who are interested in sociology and psychology because Gladwell’s writing allows readers to understand complex ideas using simple references and analogies, as well as creating his own theories such as the 10,000 hour rule.",2
3368,Amazing book. A good book worth reading,2
3369,"Do you think intelligence and hard work lead to high success? Think again.. It takes more than intellect and dilligence to get to the top. Gladwell uses interesting case histories to illustrate factors we seldom think about as leading persons to become exceptionally successful. His research is interesting, almost exciting. It may even get you to think about why you are as you are, although that is probably not his objective. Well written, easy to read even as complex and diverse subject areas are discussed.",2
3370,"Mediocre. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was a very interesting read. I did not know what to expect when I first picked it up. I saw that that it said it was the ""story of success"" and was very intrigued in how Gladwell would approach this topic. The first chapter really made my head spin and convinced me that Gladwell knew what he was talking about. It truly made me retrace my steps growing up and thinking about how I was raised and how I could have been raised differently (not that I would want to be at all). Gladwell harks on the idea that when you were born is most important to your success but there were flaws right away in that this was not consistent with things outside of sports or in America. I do not believe that his philosophy on who were the faces of the Industrial Revolution of America was valid at all. Throughout the book Gladwell seems to continually look past the hard work of many and instead replace it with fate and environment which is not fair to those who worked hard for what they have. Gladwell also dismisses those who are successful in their lives that have not gone through the ""10,000 Hour Rule"". In that chapter Gladwell describes only people who have experienced financial success therefore it is very opinionated to what success is in Gladwell's mind. An example of success that is not financial is Mother Theresa who helped thousands throughout her life and devoted her life to the success of others. She may have worked at what she did for 10,000 hours but experienced an entirely different type of success. Altogether, there are far too many loopholes in Gladwell's work and he is too quick to dismiss success of people who do not fit into his pigeonhole. I would give this book three stars out of five because although it is biased, Gladwell still makes points about stories that are true and interesting to think about but most, such as Bill Gates, are one in a million and a special case.",0
3371,Five Stars. Compulsory reading I think!,2
3372,"I would have loved this book IF I EVER RECEIVED IT !!. I was looking forward to reading Outliers by Gladwell. Unfortunately, I never received the book and my emails to the seller remain unanswered to this day. I will never order from these sellers again and have lost my trust to a great extent in Amazon. So, be warned, future book shoppers! If you really want to read a book, the library might be a more reliable, faster and less expensive choice. I gave it one star because I couldn't post my review unless I gave it one.",0
3373,very good. i had to read this book for school and it was actually so good and i really enjoyed reading it,1
3374,First M.G book. I enjoyed listening to this book. Drawing on themes that the “self made man” is a collection of generational opportunities is a very interesting concept. Especially when he draws the correlation to his personal family experience.,1

3376,"For Every Entrepreneur. This book changed my opinion on ""privilege."" After the 2016 election, there's been much talk about privilege and what it means to grow up with opportunities others don't have. I sort of have up on that topic until I read Outliers. It's a must-read if you want to expand your understanding of ""the haves"" and the ""have-nots.""",1
3377,Enjoying now. Great short reads,2
3378,"A Good ""Eye Opener"" but Gladwell Goes to Far. Outliers, like many of Gladwells other books, starts with a rather simply idea and supports it through various stories. In this case the idea that Gladwell promotes is that massive success, such as that achieved by Bill Gates or The Beatles, occurs not primarily from hard work or raw talent but rather from a ""patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” Gladwell weighs luck above all other criteria in any success story.",0
3379,Will We Change Our Ways?. Malcolm Gladwell shows an number of ways we can improve the way we educate. We can easily increase the number of gifted students. Will we? He also shows how to eliminate the education gap between privileged students and under privileged students. Will we? Or will we just sit by and go with the status quo?,1
3380,STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND BUY THIS BOOK!. PHENOMENAL BOOK!!! Where has this book been? Truly a life changing book! Great read!,2
3381,Gladwell's Best Book. Probably Gladwell's most entertaining book. We all love a good success story. A story about cases where people go from nothing to overwhelming and legendary status. This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are. The conditions that were out of their control that they luckily fell into. You also learn of the extraordinary amount of work they also had to put in. A great read. Gladwell's best book if you ask me.,2
3382,"Great buy. Great book.. This book will open your eyes and give you another look at what makes successful people. Really interesting! I have kids with late birthdays to I can relate the information concerning Canadian hockey players. My son is a dec birthday .... Guess what... He did not excel at hockey that had a dec 31 cutoff date. Even if you do not agree with everything, it does give you a new perspective and makes you think.",2
3383,"A Great Read...and a believable hypothesis!. Every so often, I really like to read non-fiction, and this is one of the best I have read. I really think Malcolm Gladwell is on to something here! What a fascinating theory! And he explains it well and with case studies that prove his point!",2
3384,"Always interesting, but not a revalation. Good read, but not the breakthrough like 'Tipping Point' or 'Blink'. In the end, good anecdotes that will be fodder for dinner discussion, but not a cohesive theme or conclusion.",0
3385,"We Are All Outliers. Also read Gladwell's Tipping Point. Outliers was recommended by someone who's accomplishments I greatly admire as having a provocative thesis about success. Enjoyed this book more than Tipping Point; it is more personal and has a very uplifting conclusion. We are all outliers -- anyone, with perserverance and opportunity, may be successful. Organized as a series of bios and stories about highly successful -- but not necessarily famous --people, including Bill Gates, to make points about opportunity. Opportunity is not equal according to Gladwell but it is critical to high levels of success. Reading this book gave me a new way to look at and think about what happens to students in schools, and workers in the workplace. It isn't only aptitude or luck that makes the difference!",1
3386,"I Recommend. I loved this book! Never boring, very interesting, gave me a new perspective on the importance of work ethic!",2
3387,"Outstanding Outliers. This is equal to Gladwell's Tipping Point and better than Blink. It contains fabulous, specific examples of how brilliance is often a factor of early opportunities available to some and not others, from hockey stars to Bill Gates. The book slows toward the end, it seems as if there is filler to make it long enough for hard cover, and I can also make a case that the brilliance is in taking advantage of the opportunities that others ignore or don't appreciate. But it's a provocative, fine read.",1
3388,Great. Great,2

3391,"Gladwell's book is very engaging and easy to read. Gladwell's book is very engaging and easy to read. His argument is compelling, though I feel like it might be somewhat simplistic at times. Nevertheless, I think he offers a helpful counter-argument to the ""American Dream,"" a picture of success that is more realistic. His argument recognizes how greatly people are influenced by their surroundings but doesn't succumb to fatalism or pessimism.",1

3393,Rewire your brain. This will make you rethink your life - and everyone else's. Brilliant.,1
3394,"Overrated. I feel like Gladwell presents an intriguing question, but he offers no control cases, except for the case of Mr. Langan. As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful. Tepid work at best.",0

Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over. Advantages they inherently had. He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying. He picks great examples and this really helps the book. The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)",1

Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful. Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point. He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality. The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",1

3411,"Well written by shallow - par for the course for Gladwell. I love him as a writer of magazine articles, he is funny, concise, and even enlightening. He is a great interview. But, as a writer of full length books, he is horribly shallow and delves into a subject about as lightly as possible. At least this book was not mind numbingly dumb like 'Tipping Point'. There was some interesting stuff here (though that might simply have to do with my own ignorance on the subject).",0
3412,"I can't take the full credit for my success.... The above statement is one of the life changing take-aways I have from the book. Gladwell, uses a perfectly selected group of examples to explain the unique, and yet similar circumstances that it took for the Outliers to succeed. However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.",2

The book goes through many different case stories talking about many different types of exceptions -- ie exceptional individuals such as Bill Gates and other early computer pioneers, exceptional events such as plane crashes, exceptional communities such as the town in Pennsylvania with great longevity, and even exceptional populations such as Asians and their achievement in math. It discusses all of these exceptions as not products of innate biological difference between people but as contingent facts to do with how individuals dealt with the opportunities presented to them and how culture shaped this dealing with the opportunity.",2
3421,"Spellbinding. I haven't read other Gladwell books but from what I've heard, he's rather hit and miss. This is definitely a hit, starting with the excellent analysis of why so many ice hockey stars seem to be born early in the year and moving on to easy to read but insightful discussion of success in a range of fields. It's never boring, not a word wasted but is worth the price of purchase alone for the chapter titled ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"", which is about as stunning a chapter as I've read in non-fiction. I won't give away anything on that theory, just read it for yourself; it is truly fascinating.",2

3424,"Seeing the forest instead of the trees. Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere.

5,"Recommended. Mr. Gladwell, Your book Outliers: The Story of Success was a very good read and it provided me with a new perspective on a topic that is widely referenced. Everyone has heard about the stories where someone goes from rags to riches, but you completely changed the way people think about success stories. Many people believe that it takes only pure ambition and talent to be successful, but you realized that there is way more to it than that. In ""The Trouble with Geniuses, Part II"", you showed that having a higher intelligence than someone else does not increase your chances of being successful. Being in school it is hard to understand how being naturally intelligent does not help because all of the awards and accolades are given to the smartest and strongest. However, the example of Langan and Oppenheimer showed me how some outliers in these award ceremonies came to be successful because they have charisma that others do not possess. Many people overlook these seemingly obvious occurrences, but your ability to convey this method has forever changed my opinion about success. In the class that we read this book in, we have an essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The goal of this essential question is to help us make connections to the things that we do in class and I can honestly say that Outliers provides the best answer to this question. Throughout every chapter you showed a new and different way to explain how success is a result of where someone is at, with two of the best examples found in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" The importance of birthdays as they pertain to sports had never once crossed my mind, but knowledge that I gained from reading your explanation in ""The Matthew Effect"" shows how much they affect success. The fact that some players will be naturally more mature based on cut off dates for specific sports seems unfair, but just proves the point that sometimes success comes from a little luck and opportunity. This chapter caught my attention because growing up I played a lot of sports and now I wonder to what extent did my birthday play in determining how successful I was. In ""The 10,000-Hour Rule"" you discussed two things that I love those being computer programming and the Beatles. This chapter contained the same theme of being born at the right time by discussing how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were in the perfect age range for when society began to become more technological, but it also showed how where someone is located affects success. Given that Bill Joy and Bill Gates were located near some of the few advanced computer terminals of the time and the Beatles were given long stints in a club in Germany, it is no surprise that they were able to succeed because along with their natural talent they were given opportunities to practice in places that allowed them to perfect their craft. Overall I feel like this book was one of the most interesting and thought provoking books that I have ever read. The amount of research that you had to put into this book is incredible given some of the hidden messages that you have found in a variety of things like why a group of people are lawyers at the same time. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that you put into this book because it really did change the way that I look at things. Sincerely, Ryan Crim",1

16,"Great information, but missing all-important prescriptive sections. Malcolm Gladwell manages to turn research books into stories that are engaging and exciting. It's a real gift. In ""Outliers,"" Gladwell supposes that there's no innate ""talent"" gene; that the Bill Gates' and Wayne Gretzkys and Robert Oppenheimers of the world are at least as much the beneficiaries of chance as they are of some talent that is so far beyond the rest of humanity. What's surprising is the deluge of research Gladwell trots out to support these assertions.",1

19,"Outliers: The Freakonomics of Psychology. Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an ""outlier."" The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.",1
20,"Fantastic book. Lots of real-life examples, evidence-based approach, entertaining to read - what else can you ask for? I wish most of the books were written in the way this author writes.",2
21,"Outliers Letter to the Editor - Senior English. Mr. Gladwell, It was a pleasure reading Outliers, which is one of the more interesting books that I have ever read in school. My teacher chose Outliers as a class reading because it ties in really well with the essential question of our senior English course; the essential question is, ""to what extent does time and place define a person."" Before reading this book, I agreed that time and place can affect one's life; however, I never thought that it could have such a drastic effect on one's success. In Chapter 4, when you told the story of Christopher Langan, I was shocked to read that such a brilliant man like Langan can have such a disappointing future. In Outliers, you mentioned that practical intelligence is ""a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills are from our families"" (Gladwell 102). I found it really interesting that the most important factor in one's success is the environment one was raised in and not the level of analytical intelligence or IQ one possesses. It is something that is totally out of one's control, yet it still has such a dramatic effect. This quote really made me reflect on how I was raised as a child. I questioned my parents' parenting techniques and debated whether or not I have acquired this practical intelligence. As I kept on reading, the KIPP program that you talked about really caught my interest. Giving children who wouldn't otherwise get the chance to learn that much and get a better shot at college and a suitable job is awesome. Everyone deserves an opportunity like that. In a way, I had my ""KIPP"" program because I grew up in Philadelphia but my parents were able to send me to private school and not a filthy public school. The chapter that talked about plane pilots also caught my attention. I agree with you that your background may affect how you perform in serious situations. Americans know not to be passive especially when something is wrong, but someone from Spain or Colombia may be passive to the pilot because they are in command. This idea shows place can affect one's work and even life. Through the years though I think many are beginning to overcome this barrier. Overall, I believe you answered the essential question really well and all your ideas were very well explained and supported with great evidence. Therefore, I do not have any misunderstandings about the novel; however, I did at times think the novel got a bit repetitive. I got the concept quickly and wanted more but you gave me the same information just worded differently. The book really gives you a new perspective on how every little thing can control one's success. It is really interesting and once again it was a pleasure reading Outliers. From, Heather Monaghan",1
22,Three Stars. An interesting subject and thesis that could be explored further and more case studies should have been included.,0
23,It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) .... Fascinating facts and examples capture the reader's attention but some of the author's opnions are not totally applaudable. It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) and right birthday... all these have to be right in order to be successful.,1
24,"Great Read. As with all of Malcom Gladwell's work, a must read. It makes you think about life and how you see it and live it. The take home point is grasp opportunities as they come, because they may not come around again.",2
25,"Nice, simple and informative reading. One of the best books that I've read in a long time.

29,"This book is a very important look at how our great innovators rise to success.. I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book.

31,"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I have always thought of myself as somewhat of an outlier and it was interesting to read this book for me.

32,Five Stars. Arrived quickly with no issues,2

35,"The real story behind success.. Excellent study of how so many success stories are due to special circumstances instead of the actual talent, among other aspects.",1
36,"Interesting. Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful. Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc. I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read. I'd recommend it.",1

40,"Great Book for a Critical Thinking Class. This is an excellent book to read for leisure reading or for a course on critical thinking. I used this book for a class in critical thinking and analyzing. The great thing about this book is the author discusses his theory as to what an ""Outlier"" is with examples and that unto itself, leads to discussions. Whether or not you agree with Gladwell, you will stop to think about what he has said once you have read the book.",2
41,Interesting studies. This book gave me a new perspective about how people create success. The reader was very fluent.,1
42,Great for first time parents.. I'm about to have a baby and this is a great read for expectant parents. I loved this book. Definitely would recommend it.,2
43,Food for thought. Interesting stories about what makes success (or failure)...and it isn't always what you think.,1

46,Good read. Mildly used and great read,2

Gladwell goes on and on and spends full chapters saying something that could have been done in a paragraph... So many pointless things... I felt such a waste of my time trying to finish the book. If I could I would ask my money back!",0

54,"Success Story. This book was a real eye opener. It shows what other people may never think of. Malcolm Gladwell explains all the insights of how the people we least expect become successful or unsuccessful. Just become someone is intelligent and has high IQ, does not mean they will always become the most productive. Timing, opportunities, culture, and practical intelligence also play into how successful a person may be turn out to be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not directed towards group. Anyone can read it and everyone should read this novel. I found it to be brilliant and useful in various ways. Overall, Gladwell wrote an excellent message through this novel.",1
55,"Great book. In this book, the Outliers, I mostly enjoyed how the author, Malcolm Gladwell, found interesting facts or details that contributes to an individual becoming successful or an outlier. For example, Gladwell looks at,”Demographic Luck” (a.k.a the effect of one’s birth date). Gladwell shows that your birth date can affect whether or not you make a sports team or become smarter than someone else. I enjoyed this aspect because instead of just explaining his theory Gladwell supports it by using many real world examples.",1
56,"Understand what he is trying to say,. Understand what he is trying to say, just feel it is a little narrow minded to point to place and time of birth when relating to people being successful",0

58,good read. give a few pages and it gets interesting,2
59,"Review of ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell. I bought this book for my 20 year old grandson for Christmas and read it first so that we could talk about it. We both found it really fascinating on several levels. Stories bring facts to life, and Gladwell is a master story-teller. His approach of telling a different story of success in each chapter is very reader-friendly in that you can read a chapter, put down the book, and come back later without having to remember what you have already read. However, I found it so interesting that I didn't put it down for long!",2

82,Good Read. In the beginning I was absolutely in love with the book but I kind of started to loose interest towards the end. I still think it's worth the read but I'm not raving about it as much as I was during the first few chapters. He uses some really interesting examples that really make you think. I also enjoyed the very casual tone/style of his writing he really speaks directly to the reader and gets his ideas accorss clearly. It was a quick read.,1

86,"Senior English. (Cont.) Although I found most of your answers to quite reasonable, I found that your explanation regarding the ""Matthew Effect,"" was quite general. I don't believe that being older necessarily makes you better at something. After all, in the context of hockey players, the older kids are only older by a couple of months. However, I did agree with the fact that our society focuses too much on initial success and we naturally write off those who don't experience initial success as failures. As a result, we do tend to make the successful more successful while those who initially fail, continue to fail due to lack of resources and opportunities. This fact applies to students in school. At our school we have enrichment programs that selectively help the kids who initially showed talent in elementary school. However, as we grow older, I see that there are people not in enrichment that are smarter than some kids who are in it. verall, I found Outliers to be a thought provoking book that addressed situations and questions that we as a society often wonder about. The book is outstanding regarding the fact that it teaches us to analyze with logic and rational. As I have mentioned before, it is the perfect book to address our essential question. incerely, erry Lee",1
87,"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2

92,Wow thats why people are succesful.. Was guided to this book by one of my sons rugby coaches. Well worth the read.

100,"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable.

Lots of great examples throughout the book to support the argument.",0
101,"Highly remmended read. This is a read for every person who may wonder why some people lead ""charmed""lives and most of us don't. It explains in well written and easy to read detail that is the hard work, opportunities seized, and belief in the unknown future that makes greatness, if not in ourselves, then in our children. A must read for all those who don't understand the wisdom of hard work being it's own reward, not handing things to people and expecting the same appreciation.",2

106,"My first Gladwell. Parts resonated for me, while others seemed farfetched. There's a difference between causation and correlation which the author fails to acknowledge.",1
107,Fabulous - a real mind bender. I enjoyed this book enormously. Full of very interesting stats and studies that help you understand why some people can achieve so much. Some underling assumptions are successfully challenged. A book to bend the mind and make you reevaluate.,2
108,Loved it!. Read this for a sociology section. Loved it!,2
109,Thought provoking. analysis fascinating,1
110,"Broad Applications. This is a well-researched book. Gladwell does a great job of plugging the issue of chance into the formula of success. However, I would have liked to see more examples that do not fit each of his arguments, as surely they exist. It would have created a more compelling and fortified point to show why these possible ""outliers"" did not attain the status that Gladwell's Outliers achieved.",1
111,"Loved it - absolutely loved it!!. Beautiful, exciting and explains why things are the way things are. What I got from this book is that time and chance is just as important as having parents who propell your academic and social education - nothing is impossible!!",2

114,Amazingly Informative. I was drawn to Malcolm Gladwell because of his Masterclass on writing. I enjoyed the class and thought I would certainly enjoy his writings. I was not disappointed.

I highly recommend all of his books!",2
124,"There were certainly parts of this book that I found quite interes .... There were certainly parts of this book that I found quite interesting and that made a lot of logical sense. Although the points are occasionally repetitive and over-drawn, Gladwell makes the point of using examples that force us to rethink the definition of ""success"". It doesn't have to mean innate ability to be smarter or more innovative than others, and can depend on a person's circumstances in life. ooking back, however, I realized there were only 3-4 chapters that I found myself truly immersed in his theories. I wasn't very fond of the fact that he spent 46 pages talking about plane crashes when the point was easily established in a third of that amount of pages. On the other hand, I related to and felt that he did a solid job analyzing the success rates of students that wait an extra year to start elementary school versus students that start earlier and are the youngest in their grade. Additionally, I liked his take on the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" because it essentially provided a perspective behind the reward of hard work. astly, for the first half of the book, Mr. Malcolm Gladwell comes off as quite pretentious, almost as if his theories are superior to all others considering the subject matter. Even though the book is well written and makes good points, it wasn't particularly groundbreaking. It had some really good parts, and some parts I didn't enjoy as much.",0

131,A great read. Highly recommended,2
132,"Well written.. I find that Mr. Gladwell writes another enticing book. I actually spent an entire day reading all the way through his third book, and to no surprise, it was one of the best reads of 2008. I actually suggested the book to one of my teachers, and she now plans to a project with next year's students in conjunction with the book. She even went about purchasing all three of Mr. Gladwell's books. It is easy to say that Mr. Gladwell will be, if he is not already, one of the best writers of our generation.",2
133,"Excellent Read - a Social Scientist version of Freakonomics. Easy to read, insightful, and very very interesting!",2
134,The Outliers - Success is deeper than you think. The outliers is mind-blowing and revealing. It shows a fascinating way to analyze human behavior. How can someone's birthday predict success? Why did life take you into a certain direction? These and other questions are answered with compelling facts and data. Situations that appear to be mere coincidences are actual blueprints to success.,2
135,"Fascinating. Well researched look at success, culture and opportunity.",2
136,Four Stars. Excellent book. I would recommend it for anyone interested in non-fiction.,1
137,An entertaining yet insightful read.. A terrific read especially for parents. Gladwell substantiates his theories with both quantitative and anecdotal evidence and uses entertaining examples that anyone can understand to show they play out in the real-world. Now I see what the Gladwell-hype is all about. Will definitely be checking out his other works.,2

140,"Outliers. I think it is an exceptional book, as it reveals aspects about human behavior not commonly known by the average man in the street. The value of ""Outliers"" in my view is that the Thesis of the author is not a fair-fetched one, but something that anyone could apply in daily life, for practical purposes.",2
141,"Just OK. The thesis is redundantly applied to every occurrence as a universal law of the universe. I rather think Gladwell fit selected historical events to the theorem....thus a tight fit. In general I thought it interesting but a ""so so"" audio book. It would not be a waste of your time to listen to the Outliers.",0

143,"Your success IS down to luck, at least partly. A brilliant book by an incredible storyteller with a profound and powerful message: it’s time to stop the glorification of genius and talent, and recognise success for what it is - a mix of opportunity, culture, luck, commitment and hard work.",2

I have heard several speakers refer to this book, specifically that people such as sports professionals, musical prodigies etc. have spent 10,000 doing their craft before they reach that level of excellence. Beyond that this has amazing sociological studies and information about why people become great at something. I don't even like to read very much and I am really enjoying this book. I am finding things useful for my own life as well as useful to train up my children. I gave a copy to my father-in-law and want my 14 year old son to read it.",2

Loved this journalist's talent ...superb and masterfully prepared, engaging stories all to highlight some common thread. Each chapter is a keynote feature of some intriguing theme. My favorite was the over-arching idea that some things are just outside of the norm and probing all the possible takes of WHY that is. Hence the title. Now, the most visual of story-tellers takes you into many time periods and cultures and slices of professions in order for you to see his perspective and buy into his philosophy. It is part history, science, statistics and A TON of human interest all blended with an honest voice the reader trusts. Finished this one in hours.",2
148,"Good read!. This book was different than what I expected; however, I still enjoyed reading it. I finished the book in about a week. It lets you know that all successes are achieved through a series of fortunate events and your core support team, such as your family.",1
149,"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas.",0

151,Five Stars. a vital read for anyone who doubts their own ability to succeed.....just got to keep on keepin' on,2
152,Simply Amazing. I am probably the millionth person to praise the author and his work in Outliers. How ideas and concepts are woven together and how fat the author reaches in time and space to weave them together makes this a masterpiece.,2

The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2
161,Fascinating perspective on normal every day life!. Malcolm Gladwell is amazing! How he finds all of this information is beyond me. But it is really really interesting! This is probably the fifth or sixth copy of this book that I’ve bought I keep lending them out!,2

163,"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",1
164,"Too Many Assumptions, But a Beautiful Ending. There's some interesting information about what it takes to achieve proficiency in a particular endeavor and what it takes to achieve excellence in your field (not necessarily what you'd think), but the generalizations here are uncomforable at best.",0

171,"An intriguing read. I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's podcasts and articles in the New Yorker, but it took me a while to get around to this book. It was nice to hear the story told in Malcolm's own words, and I found the points he mentioned interesting and sometimes surprising. The overall message is that success is as much a product of a persons upbringing, culture and circumstances, as it is to how hard that person worked or how 'smart' they are. I liked that Malcolm concluded with the fact that anyone is capable of being successful as long as they are given the opportunity to practise their talents, but I can see how this opinion might be a little depressing to those who feel like they've missed out or were not offered these opportunities.",1
172,"the first half was riveting.. I enjoyed the first half of the book. The facts and figures made sense and were pertinent and relevant. the second half was more describing cultures and why some generate more successful people than others. not certain that I agree with all of the conclusions, but the book overall is entertaining and was worth the purchase.",1
173,"Excellent. Should be read by policy makers. Intriguing readable and fascinating book which shows how luck, fortune and class interplay for creating success . I'm passing this on to so many people",2
174,Read For a Class. The book is very interesting. It is full of interesting facts. Wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't for my class.,1
175,"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",0
176,"What makes a success. This book was a very simple read. Straight forward, interesting but nothing that kept me glued to the pages.I like Gladwell 's writing so I'm not knocking the book. Content wise it was a unique concept. Once the thesis is laid out, this who are wildly successful are a product of multiple unique opportunities, it predictable. I'd recommend this book to any one who likes Gladwell 's writing topic and appreciates unique topic.",0
177,"Theory. OUTLIERS is an interesting book but I don't feel it is especially enlightening or in most cases practical. We have no choice who our parents are, where or when we are born, and much of the material in the book is based on these circumstances.<br /><br />Warren Buffett in his book, THE SNOWBALL, speaks of the Ovarian Lottery and it is hard to challenge this. It may be that with the information we are given in OUTLINERS, assuming it is factual, that we might want to make some decisions about when our children enter school. Certainly being in the right place at the right time has always been advantageous in life.<br /><br />Children born to good loving parents with positive parenting skills will always have a definite advantage in life no matter where in the world they are born. It doesn't hurt to have a little luck but in most cases luck is the result of preparation. As Gladwell states: ""Luck is winning the lottery"". Though many parents would like to blame others for their children's misgivings all should feel a responsiblity for our children's successes and failures. <br /><br />Everyone will have many opportunities in life. The key is to be aware of them and take advantage of them as no one knows when the last one will arrive.",0
178,"Good food for thought. I've had this book on my list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally had a chance to read it. It's great for conversation topics with some of his case studies (as a big Beatles fan, I love the story of their time in Hamburg and the 10,000 hour rule).",1
179,"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",1
180,"leap of faith coming short. The book is a good read, maintaining the twist on the topic at hand as per other of Gladwell's titles. The only criticism is the stretch to accept the correlation between agricultural styles and educative approaches seen in contrast between Asian and Western culture. I do not think it's a well-supported argument.",1
181,"Duh. The blurb for the book says, ""In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"".""",0
182,"AKA ""Class Warfare: Prejudice and no Pride"". This book was mentioned by several thought leaders I respect. Well, now, I respect them a little less. Basically what this nonsense spews is that when you make it it's just stupid luck. Also, poor people are stupid and weak.",0
183,Made me think. Very well written and an interesting premise. My problem is its so anecdotal that it's hard to tell if Gladwell's theory can be extended out to all of society. But the stories were fascinating and I will read some of his other work based on this.,1
184,"Great book. Great book - gave it to two relatives as a gift. I especially like the chapter on how the sewing skills Jewish immigrants brought with them in the 19th century led to being their economic springboard, rising economically above other immigrant groups of the time, and making New York City the global center of textile manufacturing in 1890.",2
185,"Love Gladwell's Point-of-View!. Malcolm Gladwell's observations and social epiphanies are thought-provoking and applicable. His style of writing is exciting, and the fluidity makes all of books and articles such fast reads! I have been a fan of Gladwell since I read Blink in high school, and he hasn't lost his charisma with this one. Reading Outliers is inspirational for those who questioned success and ever doubted their ""luck"" in finding success. Otherwise, the book puts so many events and facts into new perspectives.",2

Just like all of this other books, they provide a thorough look into something that you may have overlooked.",2
191,"Must read for those who want to know what makes some people successful and others not so much.. I found it to be a very enlightening read as it was reinforced that success is earned, not given. Circumstances do play a part but not entirely. I recommend this book to everyone.",2

194,Fascinating!. This is my second time buying this book.,2
195,Quirky. Revealing. Insightful.. OUTLIERS is the third book which slices the world view in a slightly different way.,1
196,"Unscientific. I actually liked this book quite a bit. While I liked it, overall it was rather Unscientific in its approach. There are almost no citations, so you are to take the author at his word. There are definitely some very interesting parts. The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating. The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief. Gladwell describes things as they are without sugar coating it to keep people from being offended. His theories, however unscientific at times, seem plausible nonetheless. Worth your time to read this.",1
197,"Here's hoping I was born in a good year. Malcolm Gladwell has given us another page turner. After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",1

I enjoyed M. Gladwell's approach to presenting a comprehensive presentation of the path to success across different careers and cultures. ""Outliers"" allows the reader to think differently about how people within specific cultures become more successful than others. A positive approach to achievement that enables the reader to feel more empowered about oneself.",1
215,"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",1
216,"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday.

217,"LESS IS MORE. This book, as other books by this author is long. Not long as in many pages, but long as in goes on & on & on & on on topics that do not need to be dragged out. ""COME ON MAN, I GET THE POINT""",0
218,"We can all be Outliers. From the Beatles to Robert Oppenheimer, and later understanding the cultivation of rice patties, this makes Outliers such an interesting read. The fundamental question in this book is, are geniuses really geniuses? Gladwell argues that it really where you are placed in society and maybe even luck in birth. This book was a fascinating read. Unfortunately sometimes Gladwell does not know how to end a chapter. Once a point is made, it is made. Overall, I did enjoy the book.",1
219,This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.

226,"Good book, but overlooks obvious things.. Basic thesis of the book: people are only successful due in large part to opportunities afforded them (which come in various forms, culture, computer access, birthday, type of job their parents had etc). While yes these opportunities are huge—Bill Gates wouldn’t have become the person he is without the Mom’s club buying that computer for his school. (Example from the book) He wasn’t the only kid at that school who had access to that opportunity. On a more broad scale, yes a January Birthday is an advantage to aspiring Canadian hockey players but not all those who are born in January go pro. There are deeper levels in the individual outliers that enable them to achieve. Even taking his theory at face value, wouldn’t the real outliers be the pro players born in December?? Study them. The January kid should succeed. (Again this is another example from the book). I think the book makes a good point that a lot of times successful people had incredible advantages, what it doesn’t delve into is the difference between them and the other people who had the exact same advantages!",1
227,"💋💋💋💋💋. Oh my goodness i gave this book 5/5 kisses! It was an awesome book. It talks about how successful people are rarely successful on their own. Their was an advantage somewhere that they usually don’t mention. Even though persistence and hardwork is a major factor, if more people had some of the same opportunities then maybe their would be more successful people. I love how he talks about his advantages and his families advantages at the end of the book. I couldnt put the book down.",2
228,Great book. This book was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone.,1
229,"Interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed listening to this but I can't help but discredit the conclusions made by the author a little bit due to the inaccuracy of one fact he presented in the book. According to him, Singaporeans are outliers when it comes to math championship because they come from an agricultural society, in particular rice planting nation. The cultural belief that one must wake up before the crack of down to be rich (grow, harvest, etc.) certainly didn't come from this.",1
230,"Interesting Ideas for an average reader. While Gladwell brings up interesting theories about our inheritances, he does not actually prove anything and thus the book is more entertaining than scientific.",0
231,"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",2
232,Interesting and enjoyable. I really enjoyed this book . I think it helped more than most leadership books I have read.,2
233,"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards. Given all the rave reviews and how influential this book has purportedly been, I wasn’t expecting to feel so meh about it.",0
234,"Pop-sociology for the masses. This is the first Gladwell book that I've read. It was pretty good, but surprisingly sparse. He has a knack for tying together seemingly unrelated points and his prose is understated which makes for a pretty easy read.",1

Some things manage to remain hidden in plain sight for the longest time and then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, someone or something somehow manages to lift the veil of mystery from their existence. Others may not be hidden but their cause and effect mechanisms are not fully understood until a unique perspective finally comes along and combines common sense with the multiple streams of psychology, history, culture and mathematics flowing in the background. With 'Outliers' Mr. Gladwell somehow manages to accomplish both these 'little miracles' in a seemingly effortless manner. The ability to perform these rare feats simultaneously immediately makes it one of the rarest and most important books I have ever read.",2

Whether you believe he's made his case or not, you can't argue with the facts he presents, only his interpretation of them. It will make for a great book club discussion!",1
246,"Outliers. Not just a book, thought provoking and challenging especially if you have kids! What opportunities are you creating for them and what plays to their advantage naturally due to the factors discussed in the book? There are doubters out there who disagree with some of the concepts which is understandable, that's what the book is meant to do - make you question!",2
247,"Excellent book. The many interesting facts presented in the book are thought provoking. Moreover, now when considering what led to the success of an individual, some of the factors that at first would appear to be disadvantages should instead be viewed as those that directly led to their success.",2

250,Four Stars. Great book!,1
251,Insightful. Puts personal history in a different light. Reading this book made me appreciate all the outliers in my own life that brought me where I am today as a successful physician.,2
252,"Cherry-picking. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0

254,"Not Entirely Accurate, But Good Principles. Reading Outliers as someone with a couple decades of professional experience, and many years more of a committed drive toward excellence, I was encouraged. 10,000 hours sounds great.

255,"Gladwell Rocks. First book of Gladwell, and I enjoyed it so much I bought 3 more to give to friends. It was entertaining reading, while I learned so much. Chapter 7 on commercial airplane pilots was fascinating...thinking outside the box. I'm going to read all his others.",2

259,Good book. So true,2
260,"Outstanding Book. One of the best books I've ever read from a practical standpoint. Very motivating and helped me really see the ""big picture"" of hard work, keeping my eyes peeled for opportunities, and allows me to view success just a bit differently than I had in the past.",2
261,"Fun anecdotal book which gives pause for thought.. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell, though find it important to take his writing for what it is: as an inspiration to think along his lines. His books tend to be somewhat drawn out, with long anecdotes to support his claims. Although somewhat tedious at times, they serve to help the reader remember his key points.",1
262,Surprisingly good..... .. Interesting connections one wouldn't imagine are explained.,1

266,Not a fan. Didn’t like this book at all. Just a bunch of stories about people……. Thought it would inspire me but I couldn’t even finish this book,0
267,"Takes More Than the Individual. Loved this book. Could hardly put it down. Easy to read although a little repetitive in some places. Not a reason to avoid reading it as I hope it provokes the reader to re-evaluate more closely what came together allowing the achievement of stunning success. Great success (or potential downfall) arises from an intermingling of many factors, not just the individual's efforts or smarts. Many have the smarts but the misfortune of not being born at the right time in the right place. Made me realize we mistakenly worship the ""cult""of the individual's efforts without looking deeper into the timimg & circumstances that prove to be as much if not more a factor in success.",2
268,Stunning. To say that it cleared away with myths is the least I can say.Gladwell's outliers did much more for me.His mention of the 10000 rule and examples strengthened my resolve to excel in my chosen field,2
269,Hidden agenda in arguments????. I’m not sure what the hidden agenda is but Gladwell tried to force feed you ideas with shabby and one sided success stories. You could easily take from this book that if you weren’t born into the right socioeconomic class for you’re particular field of interest and you might as well just give up and go home. True Bill Gates had a great advantage that he had an open computer terminal at the age of 13 Gladwell presents the story as if he and his colleagues were the only ones on the face of the planet with such an opportunity. It’s just not true he tells half a story in order to make a point that can’t be really supported any other way. That’s only one example of the mini holes in his ideas. I enjoyed the book thinking fast and slow but there he basically reported on findings without necessarily injecting his own ideas and his own agenda into the writing. I got a lot out of that book but I think I will revisit it because this book is having me questioning the integrity of his writing in general.,0
270,Not bad. pushed two ideas: hard helps get you there but it matters more where and when you come from.,1
271,Book. Good book,2
272,"very interesting and engaging book. Very, very interesting, definately a good read for two reasons: it is thought-provoking when it comes to our idea of how success is achieved and it is very well written! In the ending, when the author chooses to use his own family history to illustrate the point he makes throughout the book, there are some shocking passages on racism, it really makes us realize how far we've come and how much is still to be accomplished. The chapter on aviation and the way culture influences how we act is pretty engaging. I had a really good time reading the book!",1

288,Better than Blink. Excellent book - great insight and very well written. Gladwell is an excellent author and this is one of my favourite pieces.,2
289,"Success is less about personal ability than it is about opportunity and hard work.. I chose this rating because this book gave me a lot of food for thought.The information was fascinating and the writing style brisk, amusing and easy to read.

296,great. great,1
297,One of my recent favorites.. I’ve gifted this book to at least 10 people. I just can’t say enough nice things about the book or Malcolm Gladwell. It’s a joy to have your perceptions realigned this late in life - but not easy. Gladwell does an amazing job of making you reanalyze the way you think.,2
298,Essential reading. Everyone need to read this book.,2
299,A Very Iteresting read. This was probably my most interesting reads for the whole,2
300,"Complex interesting. A hard book to follow at times. With the inter weaving of how opportunities determination, luck culture contribute to life",1
301,"Fatalistic. Interesting points, but he takes great pains to disqualify years of work in favor of circumstances and luck. He'd have you think the 70 percent of millionaires who came from humble beginnings are a mere product of their environment. It's folly but entertaining if taken with a grain of salt.",0
302,Good listen. Liked it...food for thought...Liked the authors voice and although it gets a little lengthy the message was worth it.,0
303,"A Newer Perspective. Malcolm Gladwell gives his readers a brand new and better perspective on phenomena which we thought we already understood (but didn't). I really didn't know that geniuses also have to work hard to perfect their areas of genius. Gladwell shows us that anyone who wishes to do great things must put in his or her 10,000 hours of sweat. Bravo!!!",2
304,"Outliers. As usual, Gladwell does an outstanding job of exposing the critical issues we face and how they are best dealt with.",2
305,"Insightful, Yet Expected. I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.",1
306,"Four Stars. Well written, insightful and thought provoking",1
307,Interesting. Worth the read.. This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and it was a good intro. I found the portion about the speech with the pilots to be the most interesting and thought provoking. Will definitely look for more of his work after this.,1
308,Four Stars. interesting book. claims weren't always convincing,1
309,"Simply Amazing!. Is truly a great book and one that you really need to read if you're starting your career and want to be successful. It helps you embrace your ethnicity, cultural background and other personal ""baggage"" and realize the good and the bad of the hand you got dealt. The best part is that gaining that awareness will help you create a plan to compensate or potentialize these subtleties of your own history.",2
310,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2
311,"English Teachers Don't Read Their Recommendations. Summer reading, once again demonstrating that those selecting summer reading spend less time selecting the material they inflict than actually thinking about their students needs. Of all the wonderful and thrilling reads available this pedantic piece of semi-scientific fluffery isn't worth the time or effort. Better off reading a textbook on statistics than dwelling on those living at the edge of the bell curve. Flip a coin, what's the chance it will land on its edge? That's the chance a High School student will have of enjoying this book.",0
312,"Pretty good read.. Overall this is a pretty good book. The text is well written and a very informational, however, at times seems to lose focus of the overall topic. Yet despite this minor flaw, this book is a must read. Author Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job.",1
313,Two Stars. BORING!,0
314,"felt like half the story, but a great half!. great narrative and perspective. it just felt like it was building up and never really got there. what about those how are NOT lucky? Do they have a chance at success? are there things they can do to create/identify the all-important ""opportunities"" necessary for success?",1
315,"A bit fluffy, but enjoyable. ***1/2",0
316,Good read for awhile. Got tired of it Three quarters through. Got the idea of the principles.,1
317,"Fascinating.. Gladwell's books are absolutely fascinating. The topics he explores often seem completely mundane, however, the angle he takes on all of these subjects are completely unusual. The end result is a greater understanding of the subject matter and more importantly, a greater understanding of the processes being described in the books.",2
318,"Unconvincing and overly long.. I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",0
319,"The Outliers. The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called ""Skillful Teaching""....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster. I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field. Not difficult or technical in the least :-)",1
320,"Almost A Book. I gave this book three stars. Two means you do not like it. That is a tad strong. On the other hand three stars (It's OK.) is also not quite right. The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book. So, he starts with birth dates of hockey player but then goes to socioeconomic class (hardly news) and then a extended narrative about himself.",0
321,"Highly recommended. Good book. Easy to read. Thought provoking. Makes one think about privilege and opportunity. Interesting cases and anecdotes. I'll never look at self-proclaimed ""self-made"" people the same way.",2
322,"Four and a half stars. A good book that reveals how success is more related to history and circumstance than it might at first seem,especially in cases of success that are often put down to genius.",1
323,I really love it!. Is an information book. I bought it to read. It is very very good. I really love it!,2
324,"When were you born?. Well written, thought provoking book. A very good read.",1
325,"Entertaining book. I bought this book for a class I was taking in school. We were supposed supposed to study the way that Malcolm Gladwell writes since he is very successful in his style.I think he is an entertaining writer and this was a good read but I don't buy everything he's selling in it. I've read his other books as well and feel the same way about them. I'd probably like them a bit more if there were just a tiny bit ""more academic"".",1
326,"An interesting hypothesis sans convincing proof. As a Gladwell fan I took away a lot of interesting perspectives about success. The context of a person's life versus the content of his genetics...seems to be his central theme. His examples demonstrated the myriad failures of arbitrary distinctions. But his central hypothesis was not satisfactorily proved, at least from my perspective.",0
327,"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",2

332,good read - interesting information. Good book. Lot of information that I found interesting.,1
333,"Buy it now, you won't regret it.. One of my favourite ever books. Gladwell is an awesome writer who provides such an educated, interesting insight on things that you just hadn't considered. This book has honestly changed the way i now think about things. Everyone should read this book.",2
334,"In improved understanding of the path to becoming an ""outlier"", but not really a ""how to"" book. Initial data is revealing and informative. Later examples and stories are longer and less compelling. A mixed message on how ""success"" is realized, and what truly leads to ""outliers"". An interesting read in the first few chapters, then a little less so as the story continues. The final chapter, an intimate story of his Mother's path through life, helps us understand Gladwell's key points, even though it is on a different level of impact than previous chapters.",1
335,"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",1

339,Its OK. Dry read.,0
340,"awesome book but i think he rushed the ending. I really lovedthe book.And the writimg is very very good and pleasant to read. I do think Malcom does miss an opportunity that perhaps he will work on in a secomd book. Malcom takes the long standing argument between librals and conservatives of accountability vs circumstance and supports enviornmental influences on peoples lives with very high quality arguments. I really appreciate the quailty of the reaarch and the well placed word while making the argument of nuture over nature. The point he misses is at the end he calls for change at the societal level and rebridges the gap between librals and conservatives. I think Malcom need to take his findings, keep the persuasion of the influence of the envioronment on success, but then focus on the HOW wnvironment was overcome and promote individual accountability to change not just societal pressures but personal or cultural changes that people have power over. I kept expecting that part two would show how thechange of Korean Airs saftey record was implenented, the hard choices to make cultural changes are to lightly pressed upon. Had he focused on How succesfull organizations (including familes) used the understanding of culture to change their outcomes or even understanding, Malcom would have briged the gap between liberals and conservatives and more than likely, over time exerted more influence of the necessary socitial changea he belives should be made.",1
341,"quick read but how much did you really learn from it?. Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.",0
342,"Very interesting. It just goes to show that to master your field that education, talent, intelligence, and luck all factor in. However, hard work brings it all together. A 10,000 hour commitment, are you willing to put in the work? How bad do you want it?",2
343,"A must read. Excellent book! It was my book club selection. When I heard it was a non-fiction about how to be successful I thought I would be bored. Well, was I wrong. I couldn't put it down. It was fascinating . I have recommended it to everyone I know.",2
344,Cheese. Cheese,0
345,Worth talking about. The subjects and stories spur discussions with co-workers and friends that continue as new readers join the conversation. The insights are thought provoking and coincidences surprising. I found it fun to read and difficult to put down. Any book that is talked about on a regular basis is better than most. It may no be life changing but it will certainly give you a new perspective on success and who is successful.,2
346,Re-frames Success. I have enjoyed every book Malcolm Gladwell has written - his style weaves real-life examples together to support some big ideas and the examples in Outliers are rather compelling. From Hockey Leagues to healthy towns - the concept of Outliers is illustrated perfectly.,2
347,"I didn't like this one nearly as much. I picked this up after reading Malcom Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point"". I didn't like this one nearly as much, but it was definitely still interestig. I couldn't put it down at points. I eneded up giving it to my buddy to read and he had good things to say about it too.",1
348,"Good read!. This book was different than what I expected; however, I still enjoyed reading it. I finished the book in about a week. It lets you know that all successes are achieved through a series of fortunate events and your core support team, such as your family.",1
349,"Helps to understad ""Outliers"". it is a great book, and helps us to build our ability to think about ""Outliers"". Though I read Tipping points by Gladwell, I really think Outlier wins. Malcom had done phenomenal job explaining the events and comparisons. Must read.",2
350,Wonderful and Informative. If you're a fan of sociology and cultural phenomena or just a curious person this is an excellent book. Gladwell has a jovial and knowledgeable way of explaining just about anything.,1
351,"This one is a weird one for me to write, and I’ll explain why. Without being unnecessarily reductionist, I used to think that there were two types of reactions to Malcolm Gladwell: you either hate him or love him. This was an opinion informed by my own experiences, having finished an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and psychology (an area Gladwell lives and breathes in). Graduate students, professors, and my own peers would be quick to talk up or talk down Gladwell upon hearing the name of",0

He makes an elegant case, employs agreeable logic, and is a colorful story-teller. Even if you disagree with his primary arguments, you will surely enjoy the craft of his artisans' prose, and learn something new.",2
354,Five Stars. Quite an interesting insight into prodigious people.,2
355,"A great Book for Outliers and Others. Another Malcolm Gladwell book, another delightful way to learn some fascinating facts.

I tried for twenty years and finally gave up. Congrats, Malcolm.You have at least one devoted fan.",2
356,Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!. Whos GOT NEXT? this book if applied in your own life will take your personal or business life to the next level if you would but apply the principles in this book.,1
357,"Interesting Angle, But Acknowledge the Work Done. This is a great book and it definitely brings up some incredible points! It fails to hit on one important point though: the people discussed in the stories still had to put in an incredible amount of work. This point is barely touched on, almost passed over. Yes the people discussed had incredible opportunity thanks to the times and locations and even months they were born. But this is never enough. You still have to put in the work. The author almost makes it seem like anyone could have been Bill Gates born under the right conditions. I disagree. Not everyone with access to a computer in the late 1960’s would get out of bed at 2:30AM to program at 3:00AM. Plain and simple. The outliers are the people who engaged in incredibly hard work, and had some luck and help and opportunity along the way. The work still had to be done though. I agree with what the author is saying mostly, and yet I find it a bit discrediting to people’s achievements. I believe this is the other extreme of the individualism scale talking. Listen to the book and draw your own conclusions. Definitely a worthwhile read though and time well spent. Excellent book!",1

362,"We All Have Some Help to the Way to Success. I loved this book because it gives some scientific insight into what a lot of us know from common sense. I know someone who has a genius IQ, but has never done anything useful with his life. This book shows how past a certain point, IQ doesn't matter in your overall success. I also know that because the cut-off date of my birthday, my parents chose to wait to start me in first grade until I was almost a year older than the other kids. Consequently, I was always ahead of the curve academically because of my age. I know other people whose parents chose to start them a little earlier in school, and they never catch up academically. This affects their self-image of being a success and they compare themselves unfavorably to other folks. I loved this book, it is fascinating and seems to prove a lot of the beliefs I already had.",2

It took me a few months to read because I didn't find it as gripping as other writings, so I would often read a couple of books and come back to it.

376,"A simplistic tale on the causes of success. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is a tale about the causes of success. The book reads like a novel peppered with interesting tid-bits. The problem with many of his arguments is that they are too simplistic, often sensationalistic and unfounded. To economists or data analysts, ""Outliers"" feels like a case of literary curve fitting gone awry. Let me briefly outline point by point, how, many of the ideas of the book are simplistic.",0
377,great motivational read. quick and easy read - this will motivate you be be an 'outlier'.,2
378,"One of the I've read!. If success, opportunity, and privilege are themes that interest you, this book is for you. With entire chapters devoted to education, I encourage any teacher (especially math teachers) to pick this up and read it. I could not put it down. Highly recommend, it will change the way you see the world (and the way you see success)!",2
379,Interesting Concept. The book ended quite abruptly. I seemed as though the author had run out of viable arguments. The exposition of his thesis ended when the book was only 80% read. The rest was references. These are fine for verification of concept however do not add to the argument for me. I am interested in the author's theories and conclusions.,0
380,Well written and thought provoking.. Interesting read. Some of the points made are common sense but this books makes a good analysis of what successful people have in common. Definitely worth the time.,1

385,"Outliers review. I purchased this book for my son's 11th grade summer reading for school. My son says this book is hard to follow, mostly because it tells different stories of peoples success, but has no continual story line. He really doesn't enjoy reading this book.",0

390,"An informative, entertaining, yet droning novel. From the moment I began reading, I knew what I was in for.

404,"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",0
405,Good book. Very good book and I enjoyed reading it. I would definately suggest this book to someone else. It was fun reading this book.,1

The book may or may not be so original for the experts on the subject, but to me, it was extremely original, interesting, thought provoking, fun to read and revealing. I am a rather successful person myself who tries to understand the routes to success so that I can maybe try to lead my three children accordingly. Towards that end I found the book very very useful. Having read all his other books, I think Gladwell is a pathbraker. Congratulations. Thoroughly enjoyed every single page.",2

410,"Outliers: The Story of Success. Repeat and repeat of why the author thought people were a success or failure. A very boring book. As a very wise lady once said to me, ""There is no sense like common sense, or degrees as long as your arm and can't wash behind their ears!!!!",0
411,"Insightful, Yet Expected. I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.",1

413,"A must read book for those seeking life success!. Malcolm Gladwell is a thoughtful and knowledgeable writer of topics that make us all think about our lives as we know it.

439,"Outliers - A MUST Read. This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous ""Stories of Success,"" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created ""Outliers"" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule) and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",1
440,"An Outlying Success. Malcolm Gladwell creates an impressive argument about the story of success that will capture the attention of all readers.  His discussion reveals a deeper meaning behind what makes certain people successful and why others never succeed to their full potential. Gladwell's book will keep you talking for days about the pure luck of hockey players, the determination of the Beatles and the opportunity and passion of Bill Gates.  He will reveal the answers to common myths concerning IQ, math, and plane crashes, which are sure to be hot topics. These riveting accounts of success combined with Gladwell's unique style of writing and humor will surely entertain and inform his audience with a complex story of success.",1
441,Love it. Love it,2
442,A good eye opening book. Great read with very well researched examples. Written in a very gripping and flowing way. Makes it a very interesting read.,2
443,"Interesting. Though it was good information, different perspective to success. Captivating examples used. Good narration, easy listen.",1
444,Very different approach to success.. I love this kind of nonfiction audiobook. Never considered how cultural influences could become an obstacle to clear communication between pilots in the cockpit leading to a tragic mishap. Well researched writing.,1

And that those factors span across many demographics and vocations.",1
457,Three Stars. as expected,0
458,"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2
459,1) Sloppy methodology:,0
460,"Outliers, a success. This was a great insight into the world of success and the myth of the ""rags to riches, I did it all by myself story."" Gladwell explains that opportunities, timing, luck, &amp; cultural legacies all play a chief role determining if a person will be successful or not. He examines the opportunities presented to Bill Joy, Bill Gates etc and shows how the most successful people in the world would not have made it if certain events didn't happen the way they did. There are so many more ppl in the world with the capability of being successful who just don't succeed due to circumstances. The story at points was a bit scattered, but the overall message of success makes it worth it.",0
461,"Another brilliantly thought provoking read by the masterful Malcolm Gladwell. Amazing! He shines a new light on the ideal of what it is to be successful. By doing so it inspires the reader to take this new perspective and apply it to their own life and opportunities. Malcolm Gladwell never disappoints me as an author, and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this book.",2
462,"Excellent read. Thought this was going to teach me about success, instead it was an eye opener to something even better. Practical steps are not always required for a book to be great, the only we need sometimes is a change in mindset/ paradigm shift, and this book did that for me.",2

466,"Absolute Must Read. Can't stop talking about it, months later.. I read this in the summer and would re-read chapters because I was fascinated with the stories/evidence. By far it is the most incredible dinner, business conversation piece I have ever read. People will be amazed when you ask them a question like: ""Do you know what ties together most of the Junior Hockey League Professional players?"" ""Do you know what causes most major airline crashes?""",2
467,Fun to read and enjoy authors growth. I have always enjoyed the content of Gladwell's books; but as he grows from a researcher to a world renound author his books are becoming more enjoyable to read. I look forward to reading his next book.,2
468,"Easy, quick and informative. This book was hard to put down. The ideas presented by Gladwell are approachable and very useful. The anecdotes are a little redundant but they serve to hammer his points home and by the end of the book you’ll find them well worth while. An easy, quick and informative read that I plan on revisiting",2
469,Superb book on understand the drivers of social mobility. I read it in 2 days. Truly inspiring and though-provoking. I cried on the chapter about the Christopher Langhans of the world and learned a great deal about parenting ( for future reference). I was challenged as an educator.

If you have a child with talents or abilities this book could help you maximize his chances for great success.",2
475,"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2

Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.",2
480,"Outliers-Keith. Outliers is another insightful look by Malcolm Gladwell at what factors contribute to extraordinary performance by individuals in many walks of life. Not that you can take those insights and make yourself extraordinary, but you understand that there are opportunities that present themselves to you throughout your life that can make a difference, depending how you respond to them. A quick read that offers pause for reflection and a refreshing look at the dynamics of success.",1
481,Interesting book. I really enjoyed this book. it was eye opening to read about the different factors that led to success for people like Bill Gates. definitely recommend.,1

488,Good book with lots of information. Lots of information in the book that makes you reflect and understand how timing fits into many things. Also different pieces of history throughout the book.,1
489,"Brilliant.. I think that Outliers should be required reading in high school. It's not just insightful, it actually helps you understand how to succeed, and overcome obstacles you didn't even know you faced. Brilliant.",2
490,"Awesome read for motivation. I must admit starting the book with references on sports were not very interesting since I am not a sports fan, however the whole point was to reference how people's circumstances translates into an opportunity. With each example he gave, he backed it up with reasonable background information.",2
491,"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",2

495,"Bravo!. I'm a bit late to the Gladwell party, but definitely glad I came! Outliers was thought-provoking and a fast, excellent read. After reading several negative reviews that Mr. Gladwell has a tendency to over-simplify things, I think that those reviewers are missing the point. I believe several people have said that as well. I must be a simpleton because I'm having a blast reading all of his books. I finished Outliers, then I read The Tipping Point and now I'm reading Blink! Can't wait for David and Goliath! Bravo Mr. Gladwell, Bravo!",2

502,"Anecdotal evidence. This book has an interesting concept and is well written if one likes to read newspaper articles. Given its author, its not suprising it is crafted in a journalistic style. However, it was an interesting read that proposes a believable theory of how people succeed through practice and fortitude.",1
503,"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book. Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",0
504,Required MBA Reading. If you want an MBA you'd better read this book. If you already have an MBA you'd better read it.,1
505,"Makes you think. This book certainly makes you think and is enjoyable to read. It can open up a new way of evaluating how we look at successful people and how opportunity and circumstances shape our own lives. While some may argue that the book leaves success up to chance, I believe the author shows that it takes the combination of giftedness, work ethic, and the ability to take advantage of unique and incredible opportunities to be successful.",2
506,My personal review. What the author did with the book is what i liked about it.For example is where he tells us how the date of birth determines if you are going to be good in sports. Another example is where IQ isn't about everything you need to be smart. Like i was saying with the IQ it just doesn't always require an high IQ to be smart for example a layer you just don't need a hi IQ buts also a fast moving thinker so you can back up the defendant.,1
507,"A different book. I was told how good this book was so I purchased it. It is a different approach to the subject of doing well in ones work. It gives a good outlook on those who may not be considered ""winners"". It was a challenging book for sure and I would recommend it to all those who want to succeed in life.",1
508,"Stating the Obvious. Had high expectations about this book given its reviews and mention of how it would change one's life and make you feel clever. Unfortunately, none of that happened. ""Outliers"" should probable be best seen as a collection of anecdotes and observations...some interesting, some bland, many unrelated.",0
509,The book outlines the things needed for success. Great book. Gives a completely new perspective on successful people.,1
510,"Not my favorite. I kept waiting for the meaning of the book until the last page. The facts were interesting, but I got very little from this book except that success takes time and commitment.",0
511,Gladwell always a must read. Very easy reading and brings together all the those things you could see but couldn't quite put your finger on.,2
512,"Delivery. Despite paying extra for shipping, the book still took forever to arrive.",0
513,"I did not know that .... Read this book, as ever Gladwell sees behind the glitz of reported genius to show much is structural and the 10,000 hours applied to Bill Gates and The Beatles shows how they were ready to take up the opportunity which came their way. If you do not read this you will miss an opportunity for yourself.",2
514,"Really great read. I absolutely loved this book. It's clearly written, suspenseful and engrossing, it has great examples and overall taught me a lot. Great read, makes me want to work harder and have more grit, as well as hopefully figure out what innate advantages kids born in the 80s may have! 😀",2
515,"Entertaining and provides some food for thought, but don't take it too seriously. Some of the reviews here are as if not more interesting than the book itself! Mr Gladwell's Outliers is an interesting read to be sure. It is my first Kindle purchase and I read it in one night, so it is neither long nor difficult to digest in a short amount of time.",1
516,a good read. good read - worth the £3 or so,1
517,Gladwell’s unique perspectives are a gift. I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. None of his books disappoint and Outliers is no exception. If you enjoyed this or any of his other books I would recommend that you listen to his Podcast called “Revisionst History” it’s phenomenal.,1
518,"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",1
519,"interesting. Interesting, as all his writing has been.",1
520,Wonderful. Good book.,1

522,super book. great author,2
523,"I'd like to find a way to include it in my .... This book is a must read. I'd like to find a way to include it in my curriculum at school. Especially the 10,000 hr rule. Students need to know these things as do the parents. Poor kids (and their parents) think if they dont get it right the first time they are failures at life, and this is being reinforced by parents and teachers. It breaks my heart! Thank you for writing this book and sharing these insights.",2
524,"Interesting pop science book - not scientfic, but is interesting. I thought this was a fascinating look into stories of success. What's key to notice is that although Malcolm Gladwell claims, or at least suggests, that he's looking at things scientifically, what he's really doing is telling stories. For instance, he doesn't really pin down what he means by success in the book, which makes the whole thing a bit tricky.",1
525,"Great Anecdotes and Insights, But Doesn’t Tie Back Together. Great anecdotes and insights, but the book doesn’t bother to tie these findings about circumstance back to the central theme of becoming a successful person or “outlier” yourself, which I assume is its mission. For some I imagine it would actually achieve the opposite goal, an existential fear of always being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” through its extreme determinist viewpoint. I still loved the book, but I think it may be harmful for certain people to think this way, especially if they weren’t very confident about themselves going in. [AUDIBLE]",0
526,"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",1
527,"One of the best I've read!. During a discussion during a recent checkup, my doctor recommended I read this book. It gave me a totally new way of looking at life and success. I now understand more clearly why some people seem ""luckier"" than others in their lives outcomes. Very eye opening. The Author is fantastic, and I love the way he closed with his personal story. I will read more from Gladwell!",2
528,Five Stars. perfect,2
529,"GOOD BOOK. Very interesting and motivational. I'm only writing this review to meet the twenty word requirement on the kindle review, so yea.",1
530,insightful indeed!. Story of success is a classic read and has been an eye opener for me. Success truly is not only result of luck or opportunity alone but what you do of the luck or opportunity...,1
531,"Educational leadership research. As a doctoral student, I was assigned this book. I now begin to analyze how it can be used for educators as they delve deeper into student and staff conversations. How can we use this knowledge to lift up students who we would otherwise put down and ignore?",1
532,Great read for an athlete. Very well written book to give any athlete.,2
533,"Nature vs Nurture. The debate of Nature versus Nurture is an old one. Hero culture, that idea of individual exceptionalism willed from “boot strap” beginnings, prevails heavily in the US. What this vision lacks is the detailed history and nuanced perspective on all of the circumstances that set up success in spite of all other factors.",2
534,"Thought Provoking. Gladwell has once again used his unique writing style, his meticulous research and his ability to tell a story to produce an eye opening and thought provoking book. I recommend this book to anyone who engages in out side of the box thinking.",2
535,Mostly fluff. Kind of a good book with the 10000 hour rule and everything but the rest is mostly fluff for me.,0
536,"Inspiring Read. Very good read, this book helped open my eyes and view the world in a different way. I always thought that rich amd successful people were born that way, I never knew that luck had such a big factor in it.",2
537,"Well written. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, probes .... Well written. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, probes into the backgrounds of several successful individuals (plus one band) to identify what it is that has led to their success. What he finds is a relatively consistent pattern of conditions, choices and effort. My takeaway was the importance of reflection and mentorship in the lives of others.",2
538,"Causes one to stop and think. Really an interesting read! I can't quite ""buy"" some of his theories but it is so thought-provoking that I passed it along for all my adult kids to read, too.",1
539,"Very Interesting. Gladwell does looks at things in a way that many people don't. There isn't one cause to success as more of a sequence of events, timing, and luck. Recommended.",2
540,"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",2
541,Good. Was an interesting read. New insights to ponder on success. I found some of the stories and points a bit too repetitive at times.,0
0,"A great read and worth every penny!. My first Malcolm Gladwell book and definitely not my last. The book does a great job analyzing talent and success, and the seemingly minor or unnoticed entites that play a large part in determining the disposition of a person. There are a million reviews on this book but I feel it was well written and very entertaining; I found myself not wanting to stop reading! 'Outliers' will be a book that will not just sit and collect dust. This was a great book and great purchase.",2
1,"Senior English. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School. For our English class this year, we read Outliers: The Story of Success. Outliers seemed like the perfect book to evaluate our essential question; to what extent do time and place define a person? The purpose of having an essential question is to promote greater levels of thinking, which, in turn allows us to evaluate situations with a new perspective that looks beyond the obvious. The information presented in Outliers was perfect for our English course because it evaluated each situation with a deeper outlook. For instance, instead of coming to the conclusion that Korean pilots are naturally inclined to crash planes, the book evaluated reasons such as Power Indexes, and different cultures' tolerance for ambiguity. It is logical process of evaluating all aspects of a situation before jumping to conclusion that makes Outliers relevant to our course of study. hile reading the book, I found some of the presented answers to be illuminating while I found others to be overly general. For instance, Chapter 2 discussed the 10,000-Hour Rule, which I found to be rather interesting because it explained why people like Bill Gates are successful. Many of us often wonder what it takes to be next Bill Gates and I found it surprising that the answer is practice. My dad, like most parents, is always telling me that practice makes perfect. I've always found it hard to believe that practice is all it takes but I have to admit that, after reading Outliers, it does make sense. When I used to play violin, I found that the best violinists were the ones who practiced a lot. They were the ones that took lessons early in their childhood and as a result, they are able to accumulate many practice hours. However, I am glad you pointed out that other factors like opportunity and time play a role in determining success. he chapter that I found most insightful was Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, in which you discussed a theory on why Asians are so good at math. As an Asian, I was really glad that you chose to address this topic because many of my friends subscribe to the misconception that Asians are naturally good at math. I have always wondered; why exactly are Asians good at math but time after time, I have failed to procure a reasonable answer. I was almost convinced that maybe Asians are just naturally good at math when I read your book. I found it rather interesting that there was a correlation between hard work in the rice paddies and one's ability to do math. Reflecting back, it makes perfect sense because those in my school who are the best at math are the ones who don't give up. I was also surprised that you related math and language. I tested your theory that the Chinese language makes it easier to memorize numbers, by asking my dad to repeat numbers in Chinese and it turns out that he could remember them. On the other hand, I could not when I repeated the numbers in English. (Cont. on next review)",1
2,"Outliers - Gladwell - A Good Tour of the Outer End of Normality. I read the book as it is on a reading list for my job. It is an easy read and I caution you about the actual science behind it; we readers just swallow some things without checking. However, it is, like many of his books, a good tour of the subject and worthy of our time.",1
3,Five Stars. I like Malcolm Gladwell books.,2
4,"A Different Perspective on the Nature of Success. I have read both of Gladwell's previous books, and this one is another fascinating achievement. The book reads much like his other books, Blink and The Tipping Point, with some overarching themes and a lot of interesting examples, data, and narratives.",2
5,"An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and .... An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and circumstances that have shaped our world, our nation and our fortunes. Well worth reading.",2
6,"3rd time I read/ listened to this.. great material. my only issue with it is the fact that even if the greatest, rarest opportunities and circumstances become available to someone very few will run with them and stick to it for at least 10000hrs. that's the critical component that's lacking in this book.",1
7,Why is it rated so high?. This book is just a bunch of stories. There is less than 10% of useful information in it. I couldn't finish it.,0
8,"Interesting research in a readable format. I have read several Gladwell books but this is my favorite. The idea of what components create ""successful"" people gave me much to think about as a classroom teacher. Gladwell looked at success from a variety of angles and presented his information in a clear, well written style. I gave copies to friends as I found it so interesting.",2
9,"Outliers: The Story of Deceit. This book was a novel I had to read for class. While I am one who believes success can be attained through hard work, there are other factors that play into success, such as talent. Gladwell tries to dispel this, but in the process places himself in a corner. He claims talent is a small pool, and then uses a small pool that are not talented to argue against. Unless it is an overwhelming majority, there is no basis for argument.",0
10,"Great read. Galdwell is one of the premiere authors and presents such interesting facts in story form. This book made me realize how lucky some people get such a Gates being born at the right time. But it is not all luck. His 10,000 hour rule is the biggest takeaway I came out with. I highly recommend this for all people, especially adults with young kids.",2
11,Interesting Read. Interesting read but why do I have to write this Amazon? I am just looking to read for a few minutes to elevate my insomnia and this is not helping.,1
12,Good insight but very boring. The insight was interesting but I found that this was just an exposition into different lives and jumped around too much. There was very little story or anything to keep me entertained and I had to force myself to finish this book.,0
13,Five Stars. One of my favorite books ever - sent this off on a book-donation-gig.,2
14,A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a .... A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a lot of myths and is also an interesting read on how some people have become extremely successful through luck and perseverance.,2
15,An interesting and easy listen. The reasons for success are really quite incredible as evidenced by the research that Malcolm Gladwell has done. I chose this book because my sons (in their mid twenties) told me it was great. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. I think listening to this book would probably be easier than reading it because of the statistical information. Not one to read this type of book (prefer fiction and escapism) I expected to be bored but I was intrigued. It was even more interesting that it was read by Malcolm Gladwell himself. I would highly recommend this book.,1
16,"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",1
17,Great condition.. It seems people are only reviewing the actual story not the product. I bought the paper back and it’s in great condition.,2
18,Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,0
19,Eye Opening and Thought Provoking. One of those books everyone should read. A different way of looking at things we all assume we know all about already.,2
20,"Excellent use of examples and data. This nonfiction piece was the required reading for students taking AP Language in the fall at our local high school. I read it so I could work with a young girl I mentor.As a former high school English teacher, I found it very engaging- a difficult task for non fiction writers. My teen reader also liked it.",1
21,Boring. Very boring,0
22,Outliers allows us to take a deeper look at the ingredients of success. In outliers we are exposed to the various factors that have contributed to the successes of a diverse set of individuals. It highlights the fact that no one is successful solely on the basis of their own work or talent. It exposes the true story behind success.,2
23,Not what I expected. I had seen this title recommended by a few sources and thought I should give it a try.,2
24,Really interesting text. Well written,2
25,Five Stars. A PRESENT!,2
26,A good buy.. Well documented and presented analysis of research on outliers.,2
27,"Outstanding, love every chapter. Hooked from day one, was not familiar with the author and now I understand why he keeps hitting home runs, every book is a best seller, cannot put it down.",2
28,"Thought provoking. This is one of those books that at least five people tell you to read and you don't until years later, then you realize it's brilliant.",1
29,Great service from the seller. Fantastic customer service and a great product,2
30,"Good read. This is an interesting book. It seems to be well researched and the referenced studies are incorporated into the text very naturally. It's not a difficult book to read, and if you had a long journey coming up I'd recommend this book as a travel companion.",1
31,Outliers. Interesting facts to keep in mind for having more opportunities in life. Specially that we can improve with our efforts,1
32,"Interesting Stories and Ideas. Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas. Not sure I agree with it all. The author is great and is an excellent writer. I will read more books from this author. The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great. All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books. A very enjoyable read!",1
33,Must read. It's a must read. MG is articulate and crafts his thoughts without rambling on and saying the same thing over and over. He doesn't say the same thing twice. He says what he needs to and gets to the point. Each point is unique and supports the main idea. Very little repetition in this book.,2
34,"Interesting. Love the book. Fascinating from cover to cover. Makes me rethink a few things. Luck is a big contributor to success. Turns out 10,000 hours and a number of other things, even going back generations and culture are also at work. Loved it.",2
35,"Sucess analysed like never before. Malcom Gladewell uses amazing insights and showcases how individual success is a function of ' being at the right place, at the right time'.",0
36,Bounce now outliers. Another fascinating insight into the story of success. I first read Bounce which roused my curiosity on success and now Outliers further provides evidence that hard work and a great amount of luck can determine future success. As a teacher and sports coach these two books have had a profound affect on my thinking and therefore my work.,2
37,The title is the best part. I was disappointed with this book and considering stopping a few pages into it and returning the darn thing.,0
38,Five Stars. excellent,2
39,"Gladwell gives us more food for thought. As in ""Blink"" and his other books, Gladwell gives us a lot to think about, using a number of examples, this time including The Beatles, Bill Gates, and South Korean pilots. His basic thesis is that, while most successful people are smart and hardworking, the ""outliers"" are those who have been given the opportunity to work very hard and get the 10,000 hours of practice that is required to be very, very good at something.",2
40,"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",1
41,Great book. Suberb writing,2
42,"Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is. This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view. As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages. It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",1
43,Interesting thoughts. Which sound convincing. In India we often see lives transformed based on this critical opportunity. Have seen many brilliant careers subdued cause of a lack of exposure a sense of entitlement that many don't have.,1
44,Best read ever. Extremely grateful to the author for this wonderful book,2
45,"Superman Might Not be so Super. I like that this book took a different approach to those that seem to rise above the rest. Gladwell did not glorify, rather, brought them back down to the ground for us to see. It actually follows suit with thoughts on who you surround yourself with and being at the right time in the right place. It isn't the individual as much as having access to the opportunity and proper support. Superman isn't super without his powers nor did he himself create his powers. The one rub with this book is the narration. Gladwell has this sinister tone that would be good as a villain in a1920s detective story or a Batman villain.",1
46,great book. So many things to discover and learn about. The curiosity of Gladwell is amazing and gets you as excited as he is about it,2
47,Five Stars. This is the best book I have ever read fantastic,2
48,"why some succeed and some do not. I , having a mid year birthday, made note of those born in January and also those in December and that the year's difference in age made a difference in their schooling. I have also done some ethnic profiling, noting in a general way that ethnicity can influence what may be termed aptitudes. Of course, any book which supports one's own views is going to get rave reviews from its readers. It is certainly worth a read.",2
49,Fascinating. This is so right on! I never realized the advantages or disadvantages of when you were born had so much to do with your life outcome. Of course if you were born during the depression you wouldn't question that premise. But in today's time it is still very applicable. This is a book you want to keep on the shelf.,2

53,"A book packed with interesting and unusual information. After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.",2
54,"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",1
55,"Culture's Role ... More than you think. Outstanding insight. I'd heard about the ""10,000 hours"" to achieve mastery, now I understand it. His explanation of the role cultural background plays in our society explains what I could never figure out.",2

57,Great book!. GREAT BOOK! A must read for everyone.,1
58,Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable.

60,.. Nice!,2
61,"Success looks very different to me now.. I find myself wondering how a life might be different every time I encounter someone with ability or passion that is untapped, if only they had been exposed to a wider range of opportunities.",1
62,"The Unexpected Ingredients of Success. Success can often be related to something other than being the smartest or the best at something, it may have often to due with when you are born in a year or at a time in history. Gladwell makes those points in this work, while it is not an exhaustive look at success, it does point out some of the less known factors that contribute to ones success.",1
63,The Truth Is Outlier. This is my first non-fiction review.,0
64,Great syorytelling. I really enjoyed this book. The style of storytelling used was captivating making what would normally be a very dry subject interesting. I learned some very interesting things about success and the role of our environment in that success. I also find myself looking at successful people differently.,2
65,Good book.. It's interesting. I'm only reading it for class.,0
66,"Inspiring. I found this book extremely interesting - about how success is earned and not just for the fortunate few. Once I had stopped listening, I couldn't wait to pick up on it again.",1
67,Five Stars. Looking forward to this read!,2
68,Incredible reading- highly recommended. Keeping this very short but has given me a new fresh perspective on how great intelligence comes about...the key ingredient being time!,2
69,Five Stars. really interesting.,2

72,Different!. Show me a point of view that I havent realized.,1
73,What Separates Us from Most. This book was fascinating. Outliers helps us to understand that we have been shaped by circumstances beyond our control. It promotes the idea that we may not be where we are if our ancestors had been different or if some other factor in our lives had not happened to make our world much different. This is a very interesting book that I think anyone would enjoy reading.,2
74,"Yet another good book from Malcolm Gladwell!. It is commonly believed that people become successful after ""working hard"" for a long time and then success happens! Although hard work is a success factor, there are many other variables that have much more influence on success. Gladwell presents real life stories and much background to demonstrate that success mostly come from factors such as: when someone is born, their ""ethnicity"", their family heritage, their geographic location, and circumstances (i.e. luck). Some or all of these factors combined with hard work made individuals or groups of people highly successful. His examples are great and support his key message.",1

76,"ADDING PERSPECTIVE: Gladwell's expertise. As always, Malcolm Gladwell has presented a new perspective on looking at our social environment. Assumptions and lore are rebutted by practical observation and objectivity.",2
77,"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",1
78,Three Stars. didn't read the book. so gave it midway review,0
79,"simple but powerful. Why do some people achieve great things? It's not all to do with talent, there are so many other factors that make this possible. This book looks at why some people do well and what other factors are involved",2
80,"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.",1
81,Great topic. The students were excited to get this book.,2
82,Familar but Different (Another Good Read). If you enjoyed his other book this is very much in the same style and quality. It was thought provoking and enjoyable in the same way Blink and Tipping were without relying on reiterating parts of his past books.,1
83,"good book describing what it takes to become really successful. This is a book which would change your notions about success. Most people have the belief that hard work alone could make you successful. But, in this book, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the underlying factors which have an indirect influence on success.",1
84,Factors in success.. I loved this book. It is so fascinating; there are ideas about success that I had never considered. There are certain situations that need to be in place before success can happen. The most interesting aspect is the fact that success is not ONLY dependent on the person's ability and intellect. There are many other factors.Read the book and be intrigued!,2
85,Enjoyed and learned a lot. This book has amazing details about how a person becomes an outlier. I learned this is not only a matter of hard work but also luck has a lot to do with it. The luck which starts many years before the outlier becomes an outlier.,2
86,"Good read. This book was great to read, and had some interesting ideas, but the gist of the book is: success is more about the circumstances surrounding a person than the actual qualities of that person. The author sets it up nicely but in the end, it kind of feels like: ""Duh!""",1
87,"everyone with a goal should read this. great read, very inspiring. Can relate and find little things to help you succeed.",2
88,!!!!. TO READ!!! JUST TO IT,2
89,A true inspiration. This gives you lots of thought about life and gives you understanding about how to pursue a successful future and confidence to try your hardest to achieve things,2

I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.",2
92,Interesting Points But Overly Broad Assertions & Racist Postulations. I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.,0
93,Instant Fascination. Just received today and sped through the first 10% already! Fascinating read that changes how you view the world in less than 30 pages.,2
94,"Fiction. The ""Story"" of Success is a good title. There is a great deal of ""storytelling"" done in the book. Mr. Gladwell attempts to strictly correlate success and circumstance. If you weren't born at the right time, or if you did not have unfettered access to some new whiz bang phenomenon or if you didn't have the right heritage or the right group of friends, than the mediocrity of your performance is not your fault. A grand example of when correlation does not equal causation.",0
95,"Perhaps my book of the year 2020. Reminds of Yuval Noah Harari in a way it's written: simple, informative, clever.",2
96,"Interesting Read. Very entertaining read. Read it all on a 5 hour flight. I would recommend for those looking for a quick read. The main theme of the book is opportunity (which apparently, we as individuals have no control over) meets preparation and hard work.",1
97,"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",1
98,Easy to read.. Loved it.,2
99,Thinking out of the box. Malcolm Gladwell is an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the world in a non-traditional way. He challenges your assumptions and gets you to think. I like that in a book. I end up penciling a lot of questions and comments in the book margins as I read Gladwell. We have been talking in our family about the ideas in this book for weeks. This book definitely sparks discussion.,1
100,"Great listen. I love listening to Malcolm Gladwell books for the same reasons most people do. At the risk of sounding picky or blind to the fact that this is a great book, I don't think it's Gladwell's best. The Tipping Point and David & Goliath both had an amazing stickiness for me, where it's been a over week since finishing this and haven't been thinking about it as much. I STILL think about The Tipping Point all the time.",1
101,"Another article turned into a book. This is yet another article turned into a 300 page book. Only the first two chapters are worth a read. The author writing style is boring, repetitive, and predictable. This author is clearly over-rated.",0

103,Fantasticky interesting. East to read.,2
104,Understanding the foundation of one's success. I wished I'd have known this information when my wife and I were raising our small children. I'm inspired to think about and share my thoughts about how I succeeded in my life (to whatever extent I did) with my adult kids and their children and maybe they will take it from there for their children.,2
105,"Different but interesting. The concept of the book is understood, the examples were good and it did generate ideas to correlate to life as well as ones potential success goals.",0
106,Read the first few chapters. The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell,0
107,GOOD READ!. Book came on time and in a good condition. I loved reading this book! Author is a genius. It is about factors of success in America.Such an eye opener.,2
108,Motivational. I truly enjoyed this book and have recommended it several times.,2
109,"This isn't a new story for scholars, but it is a great presentation of it.. There is plenty of research in the field of resiliency that tells us that children who survive and thrive despite extraordinary difficulties do so because of some element in their external environment that worked in their favor. The disappointment: super heroes they are not. The good news: average people can step in and make a difference. Very good news indeed. While scholars might not find much meat to chew on here, anyone outside the field will love it. And it reinforces my belief that all scholarly topics should be edited by a top journalist - hate to say it (sorry to my people!) but for enjoyment's sake, I much prefer reading a journalist's book on a scholarly topic than a academic's book. Gladwell's a great writer, and unless this is your field, you're not only going to enjoy reading the book, you'll learn a lot too!",1
110,"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",1
111,"Please only focus on the facts of this book. It's a struggle to listen through his overgeneralized narrative on the statistical data. the facts the writer puts together is amazing to know, but the way he puts it is so unbearable to listen through. I hope he could clarify/ assure from time to time that he 'doesn't mean that everybody born/doesn't possess the outlying traits that he described are bound to be doomed, but just statistically less advantaged.' Please do not takes his word literal and do process if u are looking for life advice. I hope all readers knows better and are not misled after listening to the heavily biased topics, that daytoday reality does not operates statistically. Please only focus on the facts of this book and avoid taking his comments on the events word to word.",0
112,Fantastically interesting and compelling book. I originally purchased the audible version of this book but I found it so compelling that I purchased a hard copy as well. It's easy to read and relevant to anyone. I would recommend this to anyone.,2
113,"Has promise, but fell short. When I ordered this book I thought it definitely had the potential to be an interested read - and it was. I dont disagree with the idea that some of the theories in this book could actually work, but the way the author went about proving them really threw me. As a scientist it is blatantly obvious when people are manipulating statistics. The author seemed to be cherry-picking numbers to fit his model, which is unfortunate because many of these models probably do work, he just went about showing that in the wrong way.",0
114,"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",1
115,Interesting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have been a fan of Gladwell since reading Tipping Point. Interesting the points that he makes regarding the impact of historical events on the individuals within the book.,2
116,Inspirational. I really enjoyed this book and will purchase all Malcolm Gladwell's literary work.,2
117,Highly recommended. I love Malcolm Gladwell. And this book is yet another example of why.,2
118,A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,1
119,"Five Stars. amazing read, everybody needs to read this book!",2
120,"Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on .... Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on LUCK! This book has changed my world! As a hard worker, there were times when I didn't understand why my hard work didn't produce success, or that it would take so long to see results...but now I understand very clearly that sometimes it's just a matter of waiting for LUCK to show up and being prepared when it does!",2
121,"Changes the way you look at success.. Nice to see some scientific research on what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours of practice is the key.",1
122,"Fascinating book!. I found the stats very fascinating! I am not done with the book yet, but I am excited to see how it ends.",1
123,"Highly recommended. I'm a big M. Gladwell fan and I enjoy reading of his research. It's definitely a great read if you have kids or are considering. It's a book full of stories about successful people and failures as well to teach us to look outside the box when we judge people who are ""outliers"" in our society. Very interesting!",2
124,"Good book. I enjoyed this book, but got lost a few times with all of the statistics. :) I'm glad I was able to stick it out, because it does have some great information on what it takes to be an outlier.",1
125,Couldn't put it down!!!. Every review was accurate with 5 stars for this fascinating and captivating read!,2
126,"I thought I would be bored with it as I tend to read mostly fiction .... One of the most insightful books I have ever read!! Everyone should read it, especially anyone in education!! I thought I would be bored with it as I tend to read mostly fiction but my interest was peaked with each new discovery in his research!",2
127,"this book tells us that we all have equal talents. this book heavily discredits innate ability and genetics. 10,000 hours of practice is heavily flawed. I will not recommend this book.",0
128,A review of Outliers. A Review of Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell,1
129,"Good start, blah finish. I thought the start of the book was pretty neat...hockey players getting an advantage because of their birthdays, entrepreneurs who benefited tremendously from external circumstance, etc was a good story. And he applies it to a larger social message that since increased opportunities are what help cause these positive outliers we should focus on providing as many opportunities as possible. He kind of lost me in the second half of the book though. I'm not from the South but some of that was borderline offensive. And while the stats may show Asian students are better at math, I'm not convinced that patience with rice paddies is really the reason.",0
130,Good theory but poor writing. The book presents different but very convincing views towards things about success we thought we get used to and we thought we well understood. It makes me rethink what exactly makes a person succeed. That's a very good lesson to myself and also child raising.,1
131,Good!. Very interesting!,1
132,"Gladwell makes you think. If you don't want to just 'consume' books and you enjoy inspiring thoughts, Gladwell won't disappoint you. He is using illustrative examples from real world, easy to remember, easy to believe.",1
133,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2
134,Fascinating study of the various causes of success. Outliers is a fascinating book. The people you are introduced to by Malcolm Gladwell and the remarkable events that create the environments that result in their success or failure are amazing to comprehend. It also helps that outliers is quite well written too.,2
135,Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I .... Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I have read thus far.,2
136,"Nice reminder, too narrow.. Outliers: the one sided story of success.",1
137,"It Makes Sense. Gladwell has statistics that make sense about how achievement happens. It really is much about effort and hard work, though!",1
138,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze .... I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze why and how distinguished people are so brilliant and superior, but the way that Gladwell presented his points gave a logical and tangible understanding of the abstract concept of success. (Also, the amount of research he did is astonishing.)  recommend this book to everyone!",1
139,"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",2
140,Great product and service!. Great product and service!,2
141,Great read!. Fabulous book and one of my All-time favorites.,2
142,"but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers. This is an interesting book. I had never read ant of Gladwell's books, but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers.",0
143,A rational and sober explanation of events which might otherwise seem miraculous. Provides accessible insight and great clarity without the need for grandiose language or overly complex analogies. Gladwell states his case with style and grace. Both informative and entertaining - worth the money.,1
144,HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book. Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221; My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work. The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other. Well how does the author know this? Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates? To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control). Fun book. I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,1
145,I AM IN LOVE with this book. I absolutely love this book. It makes so much sense. Common sense things that I know but it is explained so beautifully/ perfectly in this book. This is one of the greatest books of my life and I love reading it. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing it.,2
146,"Re-frame your concept of success. Highly informative book. I love the way Gladwell makes you rethink what you think you know about success. As a former athlete it was interesting to turn the lens onto myself and figure out where I was on my journey. Read it. I will say this, don't be afraid to breeze through some paragraphs or sections when you've gotten the picture.",1
147,"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",1
148,"Great idea in the book but not a full explanation of outliers. I liked the book until the very last bit where the author starts summarizing the book as those with more privilege than others. Although I agree with this point of view to an extent , it is not the full story. The truth is privilege is a factor but not the only variable in successful. Effort & focus are better predictors of success because any person has control over those. Just saying people are privileged if they’re successful doesn’t help anyone in fact it hurts society by instilling doubt in the individual due to his lack of privilege.",1
149,Fast paced. Book moves quickly and the short stories used to describe these concepts were interesting and enlightening.,1
150,Brilliant examples - would love more obscure ones too. All of the examples were eye opening and yet oddly predictable. The way he wrote was addicting and easy to digest. I would love a book by him on agriculture and farmers/ farmer suicides.,1
151,Four Stars. Good book,1
152,Best Book!. Best book ever!,2
153,"Interesting concepts. 10, 000 hours, honor, .... Interesting concepts. 10,000 hours, honor, gives a different view of human behavior.",1
154,Changed my perception of success!. A great book for motivation,2
155,"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",1
156,Five Stars. it was a gift,2
157,"Pessimistic Excuses To Demotivate Everyone. The author is basically arguing that all phenomenally successful people are products of the privilege and luck! While there is some validity to his argument, it clearly devalues hard work and effort. It’s so ignorant! It tries to blame culture and community you were brought up in for your successes and failures. It’s so pessimistic and miserable! It’s a waste of time.",0
158,Outstanding. This author clearly has a gift of drawing together diverse academic studies and weaving them into a narrative that is at once simple and complex. He succeeds in giving us a powerful picture of what makes people succeed.,2
159,A bit forced. I must admit that the author probes all what he said. But some analisys sound a bit unnatural for me....,0
160,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",0
161,"A good read for a day on the beach. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and his anecdotal based style is certainly entertaining. I learned something new from this book, which I read on the beach in Croatia. I missed a vision with the book. Now that we know these relationships that Malcolm has showed us then what are we going to do to make the world a better place. Anyway, the book is worthwhile reading.",0
162,What a horribly boring book for a teenager. I only purchased this book for one of my high school kids. What a horribly boring book for a teenager.,0
163,Three Stars. As expected,0
164,"Hurrah for Gladwell. Every book by Gladwell is a gem. This is no exception. Just read ""Blink"" .... a must-have in anyone's",2
165,"Interesting theory but not totally accurate. I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory. I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.",1
166,"Interesting read. I enjoyed the book, I especially liked the stories regarding Bill Gates and also the commonality of plane cranes.",1
167,"Great insight and the stories to prove it. This book was a pleasure to read. The thought progression was clear and easy to follow. The points were made by interesting stories and human examples that kept you wanting more. The points from how to become an expert, to how that expertise is used is clear and insightful. Malcolm Gladwell made his case and proved it well.",1
168,"Great book. This book really gives you the opportunity to see outliers from another perspective, more realistic more human, thanks to that, you can change your mind and see the world with the eyes of hope.",2
169,"Great listen. Intriguing, interesting and fascinating! This books makes one aware of how important the environment, culture and timing is to a person's success. well put together , a must read/listen.",1
170,"Back To The Past. That's the most appropriate title I can think of for this great piece of science. In a nutshell, Gladwell illustrates how important our past and enviornment plays in how and what we do as we mature. This is a brilliant but simple expose on what all the genius stuff is all about. No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders. Its all about the parents. We are the creators of our own children's destiny. And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG! its us. No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it? its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are. I love all the case study stories--they're really interesting--of those whom have risen above and succeeded. And I love the fact that ""Outliers"" says We Can!!! Plain and simple. Great book",2
171,"A read to remember. The beauty of Outliers is it's detailing. Malcolm Gladwell take you through a journey a amazing revelations with analysis, data, history. The way each of his ideas unfold is mind-blowing. The chapters that involves plane crashes, asian maths, the 10000 hour rule, concerted cultivation are something to ponder on for a long time.",2
172,"not bad. Wasnt easy reading! If someone read this that didnt have much of an education they would have difficulties. However, for me content was good and informative.",0
173,"About successful people, not real outliers. Was disappointed there was no discussion of iconoclasts.",0
174,"A great read!. I love Malcolm Gladwell's writing style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book very much and could not put it down. I like how he sets up a sequence of events in a story that is full of facts and perceptions, that by the time he gets to the juicy stuff, I have already been intrigued and ready to learn something else I did not know about people and success. Thanks!",2
175,"Practical and always good for a second read!. Malcom Gladwell’s style of writing and practical creative example is what made me read this book again. Its just tickle some thoughts, memories or failure where it boost you for a forward and positive thinking. Love it! All the respect . Namaste",2
176,Five Stars. Great insight into success. Quite a revelation and once you know it kind of seems obvious. Would recommend.,2

184,Eye opener. Simply amazing and eye opener.,2
185,"Good but fairly general info.... This book was recommended to me by a professor of mine. It has a lot of good/interesting information in it but I'm not 100% certain that all the thoughts in this book are well laid out or at least aren't described thoroughly enough to convince me. I would still consider it a good read, like most of Gladwell's material.",0
186,Freaking Awesome. One of the best books I have read that offers an interesting and relevant approach to some of society's common issues that affects how people view success. It humanises the Socias sciences. I had my 13 year old daughter read it which allowed her to gain confidence in her ability to become better in the activities she wishes to put the effort into.,2
187,"Not what i expected at all. Basically a lot of long winded stories, often making it hard to find how it ties into the sunject mater, to get his simple point across. Basically successful people or outliers work very hard to get where they are, have help from family or friends, have hard work and success instilled in them from a young age by their family or culture, and catch lucky breaks along the way. That was the whole book summed up with out all of the filler non sense.",0
188,Ok. Okay,1
189,"Outliers: story of success books. Haven’t finished the book yet but it is quite interesting however, it’s statistics is quite confusing and not for the laymen",0
190,Four Stars. Interesting but a little slow. Still working on it.,1
191,Book you really need to read if you are interested in being successful. For non fiction this a great read. The facts he gives give a lot of food for thought especially with regards to whether or not a high IQ guarantees success or do other factors affect how well you do. If you are in education or motivation you will find it really interesting. We are using it as book group book and it is sure to spark a lot of discussion!,2
192,Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,0
193,"New Way to think about things. Worth the pick. I did enjoy learning to see things through a different light. At the end of the day, achievement and success might not be as far fetched as it is made out to be.",1
194,Five Stars. Great read,2
195,"A mesmerising read, from beginning to end.. This book is incredible. It's insights are fascinating and challenging. Gladwell puts his point across so clearly and methodically, with humour and great storytelling along the way.",2
196,Garbage. This sucks,0
197,"I never knew.... Never judge a book by its covers, especially when it doesn't have a cover (read it on my Kindle). I read this book with never knowing that hard work could breed success. The 10,000 hour rule that was mentioned was very profound and devastating. I am a professional in the medical field, and after reading this book I no longer feel that it's ethical for me to continue practicing. I hope to one day practice again, but I want to wait until I've got a little more practice under my belt (8200 hours to go).",2
198,"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",1
199,"Interesting..... This was an interesting book to listen to. I found it shocking how Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs were all born months apart.

200,Five Stars. Excellent,2
201,"False attribution to the success of Outliers. Very good, although what lacks substantially here is how each outlier benefited more from luck than the ""10 000"" hour rule.

Gratitude is where I believe he was going, instead the final chapter/interview seem to shift from gratitude into “you didn’t accomplish this, you did because someone else”. It seems to miss the hard work requirement of the individual and that individuals made every single choice. Maybe he covers that in other books. Still would recommend the book, gratitude is what I am taking away from the read.",1
206,"learned something new. Gladwell helps to identify the ""conditions"" that contribute to above or way above average success in a range of activities. As usual, the content and narration are first rate.",1
207,Four Stars. I think every child should read this book.,1
208,Looks like super people not so special after all.. Looks like super people not so special after all.,1
209,"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",1
210,"This book will stick with me.... I was fortunate to hear Malcolm Gladwell speak recently while at a conference. I had never read one of his books but after that conference I could not wait to do so. I decided to start with this book because my 16 year old son is required to read for his Junior Honors English class in high school (summer reading). I thought it would be a good book to discuss together. Was I right! He liked it just as much as I did. And, he is a hockey player born in August...this book really hit home for him and now has the reason why he will never be a professional hockey player in the NHL:)",2
211,"Four Stars. Great book, makes clear and concise connections between demographics, history, culture and intellect.",1
212,Magnificent.. This book is amazing. Although it is more likely a kind of research book but it’s not boring me. I have more knowledge about the secrets of numbers of successful and famous people. Some of them are my inspirations. I love it.,2
213,Awesome. Great book. Seriously. Everyone should have to read this.,2
214,Great Book. Great Book! I bought it for me and my girlfriend and we got a lot out of it. Great stories of journeys to success.,2
215,Outliers. Unique and interesting,1
216,Amazing book. He develops his points in a subtle but shrewd way. Uses great examples from different areas. generally great writing as well,1
217,"good quick read. I liked the message and the examples used, though I think the story could have been told, and the message communicated in fewer words. Still, a good read that is informative and easy to read.",0
218,"Food for thought book. I enjoy books that are thought-provoking. Really is more of an informative book with lots of interesting observations to ponder. Honestly, I am still reading it so I'm not sure what my true final thoughts will be",1
219,Five Stars. Amazing!,2
220,"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",0
221,"As a small business owner I had hoped to get .... As a small business owner I had hoped to get something out of this book that I could use myself. Since the bulk of the stories are about 19th century immigrants to NYC, I didn't get too much. I didn't take the stories as much more than an indication to look around and see what could be done to improve myself with the ideas and skills that I already have. Already doing that.",0
222,"Wasted money. I wouldn't recommend this book. I purchased it because a friend said it was a must read about success. I guess I just have a different view on what is a ""must read"".",0
223,Outliers. Have not finished to book. I just can't seem to get into the concepts. I will keep trying to get motivated to turn the pages. I guess it was not what I expected. Others seem to love it and recommended it to me.,0
224,Nice Book. Everything fine just didn't liked the cover it is removable.,1
225,Not as good as his other works. I enjoyed Blink and Tipping Point but I felt Outliers read like it was put together on short notice. The examples Gladwell used to prove his conclusions at times seemed forced; like the evidence could have been interpreted many different ways and he just manipulated it to work for his point. It was still somewhat interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for it again. Pick it up used.,0
226,Great Book. Very interesting topics. The style of writing is very intriguing and keeps you hooked and wanting to know more.,2
227,"Hard work and focus actually mean something. I recently heard the saying that it takes 10,000 hours of work and study to become an reasonable expert. I had become frustrated by people who think that a few hours of searching Google is somehow equivalent to a Ph.D. or MD. Or how Canadian hockey players are better when they're born during certain times of the year.",2
228,"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",1
229,"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success. The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom. The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? n ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",1
230,"Good Read.. Good book to read but does that means if we are in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is not much chance for the rest of us!",1
231,"I highly recommend this book. The book provides incredible insights into the top-tier successes in our society. The information is incredibly insightful and thought provoking. So much so, that after I started reading Outliers, I did not put it down until I had finished it. It gave me a deeper understanding on how some influences in my childhood played a role in who I have grown up to be. I highly recommend this book.",2
232,Gift for a friend. They enjoyed it thoroughly.,2
233,"Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell. The author combines the envious theory of socialism, mixed with self guilt, adds a dash of interesting stories and comes up with a transparent, flat manifesto of ""Free Societies are Fake"". He leads with a story of how the DOB of kids in elite Canadian hockey predicates their success. It hooks the reader. The story has merit and is interesting. There are a couple more catchy tales like the Montana rancher vs. Oppenhiemer and the Chinese rice farmer and rationale how the Chinese language is better for math. After these however it becomes clear that Mr. Gladwell wrote this book to push his beliefs that socialism is far superior a free society. Mr. Gladwell, IT HAS BEEN TRIED and failed all over the world. Eventually you simply out of other people's money to spent. The idea that there could have been hundreds or thousands of Bill Gates' if computers would have been supplied to everyone is purely a utopian pipe drem but it is an approach Socialists have asserted many times throughout history. One of the key elements the author chooses to exclude are the choices people make. Granted, if every person would have made the same choices as Bill Gates when afforded the use of computers then there would have been more Bill Gates' but we are talking about living breathing human beings and it simply doesn't translate. Choices are a much more important component in a free society than in a socialism/communism. The author's rhetoric really only accomplishes 2 things. Number one, it decreases his feelings of self guilt for being born into a ""privileged and entitled"" family. Quite simply, it makes him feel better about himself and number two it improves his public appearance by using his ""entitlement and privilege"" for the good of all those less fortunate. Again, an attempt to make himself feel better.  It is clear that you despise the thought that a person can be independent. I don't know where or why you have formed these concepts but I bet it is a product of how YOUR surroundings have influenced YOU. I gave your book 5 stars for the specific stories you tell but had to subtract three stars for the way you use them to justify the worn out idea of Socialism. I hope you will take all the money you make from you book sales and use it top make your self feel better because you are such a good person you deserve to feel good about yourself...in fact you are entitled to it.",0
234,Q gracias todo llego muy bien. Llego como se mira en la foto gracias excelente y muy barato,2
235,Another way of seeing.. My 16 year old grandson was asked to read this over the summer. I read it in order to talk with him about it. I thought the first 1/2 was the most applicable for a teenager and I enjoyed that part the best. I look forward to some discussion once he has also read it. I am an MSW and always am intrigued by this type of book that takes a new way of seeing human accomplishment.,1
236,"Outliers ""hits the mark"". Malcolm Gladwell has taken populr opinion on what it takes to be ""successful"" and turned it on its ear. I teach in public middle schools and high schools. A minority of my students think that hard work is more important than to be born with ""it"", whatever ""it"" is. Good math students are popularly seen as being naturally ""good"" at math while the less industrious ones lean on their parent's excuse of ""I was never very good at math."" The 10,000 hours of practice required to become ""good"" at ANYTHING is a number I can support. I have taught students from kindergarted through graduate school in college. The more dedicated to their education, the ""smarter"" these students become. The message delivered by Mr. Gladwell is music to my ears. I have quoted his stories in all of my classes to extremely receptive audiences. I heartily endorse this book for students of all ages.",2

242,"Yet another fan. This is a great book. Much more than the ""10,000 hour"" rule the book has become known for, it goes into detail on why and how we are a product of everything that has come before us. Some things are luck/chance, like being in the right place at the right time. But also how being aware of the things that have contributed to out personality, we can work with and grow beyond those things.",2

247,"Important, interesting, and thought-provoking book. In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell explores how hidden advantages and opportunities play a role for people who've achieved extraordinary success.

248,Five Stars. Very interesting,2
249,"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories. Christine Brown-Quinn,The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.",1
250,Love Gladwell's books. Outliers is a fascinating story of genius. No one gets there alone. He's one of the best thinkers out there. I just purchased David and Goliath for another great read. When you find an author like this you want to keep going and read everything they have to offer.,2
251,"Interesting Facts. The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful. In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",1
252,I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I greatly appreciate how he incorporates data and research into his logic. It gives my brain some substance to chew on. Outliers is great at pushing the reader to rethink how they evaluate success and consider what factors really effect finding it. Gladwell's writing style is very accessible and not overly academic which I also like.,1

257,"Could be half as long. I did enjoy this book, but I found it a bear to finish. Gladwell starts to make his point in the first chapter and then just beats you over the head with it until the end. He is very thorough, to the point where I felt my intelligence was being insulted. Half way into the book o audibly said ""okay, I get it."" Less historical story telling and more application of his idea would have been great.",0
258,Good service. Great book. Good condition and reasonable price.,2
259,"Thought-provoking. This book reminded me quite a bit of David and Goliath, which is the first Gladwell book I read. Sometimes the conclusions feel oversimplified or even far-fetched, but the book certainly is though-provoking. I enjoyed it especially because the stories made me reflect on my own life, legacy and community so I could more clearly see why I am who I am and where I am going.",1
260,"Can Outliers become the new Normal? YES! If we know how to design the right environment to learn, grow, and contribute..

267,"Outliers-Keith. Outliers is another insightful look by Malcolm Gladwell at what factors contribute to extraordinary performance by individuals in many walks of life. Not that you can take those insights and make yourself extraordinary, but you understand that there are opportunities that present themselves to you throughout your life that can make a difference, depending how you respond to them. A quick read that offers pause for reflection and a refreshing look at the dynamics of success.",1
268,Five Stars. SCHOOL BOOK,2
269,"Excuse me!. The whole premise is that if you're not born at the precise ""right"" moment you will not be sucessful. This is a great book for those losers in life who need an excuse for not being successful! He makes some interesting arguments but I don't buy into his premise.",0
270,"You get what you work for... but how much you get often boils down to luck.. Quite a brilliant examination of success, and in particular the effects of good luck on the rewards from hard work and talent. Gladwell's work neatly illustrates fallacies right and left.

280,Educational. Shows very clearly how peoples' stories and statistics .... Educational. Shows very clearly how peoples' stories and statistics can be so misinterpreted. Also throws a different light on the factors that contribute to success. I shall say no more as it would spoil the surprises.,2
281,"Work of Genius. Rarely do I find such great storytelling skill in works of nonfiction. I went chapter after chapter excited with Gladwell's perspective on Outliers. Clearly, he must have spent a great deal of time researching for the book, and I daresay the effort has paid off. I recommend this book to everyone with questions on success, especially the young generation that is preparing for the world ahead.",2
282,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer. You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories. But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""? The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point. Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past. You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"". Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech. And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous. Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success. Surely the successful need to ""share their success"". Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals). This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",0

While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me? What steps do I need to take to replicate the ingredients for success? The answers to these questions go mainly unanswered. With that being said, I highly recommend the book! It is excellent information and with a little work I think we can come up with some great applications to propel ourselves toward greatness!",1

Sure, his points are novel in the way that no one seem to have the time to notice (simply put, they are all common sense).

311,"Cool, cool (but...). This is another Gladwell's cool book. I've read the all and they all are very enjoyable and fun to read. The missing star is because I found as if Mr. Gladwell is repeating himself. The collection of clever ideas and unusual data has become Mr. Gladwell's trademark. But in his previous books everything was based upon some powerful insights. According to my taste the basic premise behind Outliers is not as powerful as the other two.",1
312,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2

However would buy for first few hours. Overall style of writing is good and narrator is enjoyable.,1

Gladwell did a thorough analysis on all of the factors that can contribute to one's success that are often overlooked or taken for granted. Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter. We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit.

320,"Senior English Letter to the Author. Mr. Gladwell, y Senior English class has just recently read your book Outliers. The focus of our class and its curriculum is to pursue an essential question and apply it to our studies to give us greater perspective. The particular question my class must evaluate throughout the semester is ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Your book has been an excellent choice for the class, as it reflects upon the themes of time and place quite often. Throughout the book, you elaborate upon the idea that talent is not necessarily an innate quality in and of itself. Instead, you stress that often luck is a factor, mainly in the form of a person's timing or the culture they come from. Outliers are more often than not the result of elements that are out of their control, as you explain. ne chapter that stood out to me was ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" This chapter highlighted the necessity of hard work in achieving success, but it was interesting and surprising that you assigned a specific number to it. The examples of Bill Gates and the Beatles explained your point. For Bill Gates, in particular, the themes of time and place fit very well. He was born at such a time that computers were just becoming more of a present force when Gates reached maturity. Random events allowed him to have essentially uninterrupted access to high-end technology, which was further made possible by the lack of large-scale computer fluency during this time. Were Gates born at a different time or place, he would not have had access to all of these tools and advantages that allowed him to complete his 10,000 hours (even though the explanations provided did seem a bit revisionist). Practice does make perfect, I guess.  had a difficult time connecting with the chapter ""Marita's Bargain."" It seemed as though the stress Marita faced was being pushed as a positive. For disadvantaged students such as her, I do agree that the KIPP schools do a great job of making them rise above their socio-economic situations. However, do you feel that this sufficiently addresses the problem? To me, it seems more like a band-aid. I feel that a lot of the point of this chapter was strained in order to get across to us that underprivileged children are still smart. Which is not to say that isn't true - it is just overstated in this chapter. I also find it curious that in the case of children like Marita, time and place suddenly does not matter. How is she able to overcome her disadvantages and inherent ""bad luck"" so easily? You offer a rather politically correct explanation, something that people in our time (especially those higher on the socioeconomic ladder) love to hear in order to feel better about themselves. I am a huge supporter of education and equal opportunity for everyone, but even I thought this chapter felt a little forced.  also found myself disagreeing with the ideas presented in the chapter on IQ. Your essential argument is that intelligence is not really a factor in success beyond a certain point, and in fact that it is not really a deciding factor at all. The example of Christopher Langan's genius-level IQ but strangely ""unsuccessful"" life is interesting, but it is merely an anecdote that I do not believe can be the basis for the sweeping generalities you make. The chapter seemed guilty of forcibly adapting the theory once the necessary outlier had been found. (Cont. in next review)",0
321,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer. You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories. But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""? The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point. Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past. You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"". Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech. And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous. Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success. Surely the successful need to ""share their success"". Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals). This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",0
322,Four Stars. like,1
323,MUST READ. Fantastic book. Talks about success in a way where you dont feel you have been failing all your life. So the stories and characters are great. It is not one of those I told you so books it actually teaches through its stories.,2
324,"NOT all it's cracked up to be. I'd give this a single star, but the creativity of the subject is enough to warrant at least two stars. Plus everyone seems to discount one-stars as vendetta reviews.",0
325,Five Stars. Excellent arrived within 24hrs,2
326,"Course Material. I enjoyed the first half and second halves separately, to me this book has an overall message and content but could be separated and the end result would be much better.",0
327,Great book written by a great author. The book provides a detailed review of success and the lives of many successful people in modern history. It is an eye opening book. You enjoy ready this extremely well-written book and you learn a lot too.,2
328,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck. It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary. For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced. Based on your astrological sign! That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older. And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference. That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children. Is that fair? No. It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up. Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year. That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2
329,"Interesting perspective!. I preferred BLINK to this read, but OUTLIERS was still a good read in regards to a unique perspective as to why certain people are inherently successful. Give it a go!",1
330,Four Stars. Fascinating read.....,1
331,I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising account and very well researched. I like that he looked at things from a completely unique perspective. It certainly gave me some new ideas to think about. Putting a little more effort in studying and learning more about my profession is one of the things that I certainly took from this book. Sometimes all you need is a good book to remind us that we need to step up our game!,1
332,Stories that resonate. There were several examples in this book that were extremely interesting and offered a fresh perspective but ultimately it seems like the stars aligned and the perfect combination of factors influenced success in many of the big stories.,1
333,Planning for future of children. This is good info. Good for advising schools and next generation planning. Asp to encourage diligence in chosen career of younger people.,1
334,"Wonderful read. Great read, very insightful & educating. I really enjoyed learning about reasons for success beyond the outlier's control.",2
335,Read it twice. This book is so great. I conducted a weekly reading group with it. People who read it are still talking about the genious of Malcolm Gladwell. My grand children read it in high school. A family friend read it in college. It is an award-winning book!,2
336,"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",1
337,some surprising keys to success. The author uses multiple examples of how cultures and supporting circumstances contribute to success. His examples are very convincing and provide food for thought as to how we may achieve greater success in education and achievement in this country and around the world if we apply these principles.,2
338,"Very Disappointing. This book was recommended to me a while back and the person that recommended the book was so passionate about it that I was sure I would love it too. But after listening to it, I see why they only raved over very minimal parts. The lessons of ""outliers"" and what they are is very valid and informative, almost inspirational even, but after over 7 hours of listening I maybe took away 4 truly VALUABLE lessons that accounted for less tha an hour of my listening time. This book is unnecessarily long and a lot of the information within doesnt really serve to enhance the lessons this book means to express. You could shave 60% of the content of this book and still get those same messages and honestly, a better reading/listening experience.",0
339,"Fascinating stuff. This book had been recommended by a friend, and since I had read Gladwell's THE TIPPING POINT and liked it, I decided to give this a try. It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come ""out of the blue"". Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.",2
340,"Putting success into context. Very thoughtful read, encouraged me to think a little differently about how I see things",2
341,"Fun and Informative. Although Gladwell has been taken to task for over simplifying things, Outliers is still intriguing because it gives you a glimpse of processes that happen invisibly in our daily lives. It will also make you count up how many hours you've been practicing certain things and maybe decide whether it's worth it to continue... Gladwell reads his own book well. Listen if you enjoy learning about all those little things you may have once wondered about successful people but never had the time to go find out yourself.",1
342,Some interesting insights. There were some interesting insights here unfortunately the author felt compelled to say the same thing over and over and over again which became very dull. The sporting examples got boring after a while and there was a lack of research in some areas - I got bored.,0
343,"Not my taste. Such a drag, some parts picked up, others just boring.",0
344,Great reas. I found this to be one of the best reads I've read in years. It's a good book with a lot of substance. Gladwell writes in a very simple style that is entertaining as well as very thought provoking.,1
345,Interesting. Interesting data and helpful hints on life,1
346,Very eye opening. Very good,1
347,Five Stars. What a great read! Really fascinating.,2
348,Best read ever. Extremely grateful to the author for this wonderful book,2
349,"A Neat and Informative Body of Information. What an amazing book. For me the word outlier has a very mathematical meaning, being part of statistical analysis which I taught. It was interesting to see another dimension presented in the form of actual real life variables coming together to have profound affects on the lives of some very significant people. There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747). I can relate to the struggle to rise up in social rank. My mother's family were Irish transplants from the potato famine of the mid 1800s on one side, and a runaway to sea from the island of Mauritius on the other. Overall the level of academic excellence in this book and the quality of intellectual thought makes it a worthy read.",2
350,Have to read!. Gladwell is good. A holistic view about success. Very interesting conclusions and nice stories from real life.,2
351,"Success has many parents. An interesting account on how some people become icons in their field. Gladwell covers everything from sports, to high-tech, to legal and entertainment professions. All with facts, opinions, and interesting biopics.",1
352,"Entertaining and fun, but not compelling. Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style. His writing is beautiful. The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",2
353,"Great points, but slow at times.. In typical Gladwell fashion, this book has the power to transform the way you think. His evidence is truly compelling and for the most part it's engaging. The one problem I had with this book was how many stories there were. He would start every chapter with a story--often a slow one, building up different characters and setting the stage, and then he would start another story, and another one. You would realize the points of the stories, but he wouldn't really spell it out for you until the chapter's end.",1
354,Inspirational book but I did not agree with the book's .... Inspirational book but I did not agree with the book's notion that success depends on the time frame an individual is born.,0
355,"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",0
356,"Thought provoking. Each example of the background of an outlier was fascinating. Gladwell has dug deep and shows that preparedness, hard work and opportunity lies behind most success.",2
357,Four Stars. Gladwell's inquisitive mind produces another best seller.,1
358,"Fun and thought provoking. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, this is another must read. It's interesting and makes sense. I wonder, why don't we do what he is suggesting about how we measure genius, intelligence and luck?",2
359,"Interesting...very interesting!. I read this because it was the summer reading assignment for my seniors this year. It started off really strong with some amazing information, but somewhere toward the middle it started getting a little dull. Upon our classroom discussion, most of the kids agreed with me on this point. However, I still would say it is worth reading because it raises some curious issues.",1
360,Worth reading. Interesting read. Still haven't finished it because the book drags in some places.,0
361,Five Stars. Great insight into success. Quite a revelation and once you know it kind of seems obvious. Would recommend.,2
362,Pretty good. Very interesting.. Good outcomes are a combination of lucky circumstances to set up people to be able to work hard. If people combine those lucky circumstances with their own effort and intelligence that's a recipe for success.,1
363,"a fair attempt to simplify something complex. This book attempts to explain how those considered outliers achieve fantastic success. The cultural background, date of birth and opportunities at work, wealth and parenting types. He does a great job explaining the importance of all of these things but frankly over simplifies and boils success down to almost only these things. He refers to "" individual ruggedness"" as dangerous and discounts individual performance and success to a community effort. He makes some very good points but he simply points out why the ""outliers"" the Bill Gates of the world succeeded because of there time, place, and opportunities combined with his hard work to become something fantastic. His theory does not explain how most of us non outliers can be successful given very similar circumstances.  In short this book is an oversimplification of a very small group of people.",0
364,"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",0
365,"Great Look Into What Makes Up Great Persons. After hearing ""Outliers"" mentioned by media outlets and social circles for years, I finally downloaded and read the book. This compilation of various Outliers in history and the circumstances that allowed them to become these outliers is presented in a unique and interesting perspective by Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys seeing an interesting perspective into what goes into making some one an outlier",2
366,"Interesting, well written and thought provoking.. It's one of those books where you keep telling people snippets of information (badly reproduced)",2
367,"Intriguing book. I was very intrigued by the first half of the book. Great ideas regarding the influence birthday cutoffs have on our future development path. However, the second half seemed to wander and I didn't feel there was a connection to the concepts presented in the first half.",1
368,"Simply explained and still the stories intrigue!. I first discovered Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, Revisionist History because I, too, at that time was thinking about doing a podcast to tell my stories. And while I was not the one to buy the book and my husband not listening to podcasts, I would speaking highly of Mr. Gladwell. My husband the. Took his Master Class online and then bought this book.",2
369,"Malcolm Gladwell is a brilliant observer of people. Malcolm Gladwell is a brilliant observer of people, their thoughts, and interpretations of events in their lives.",2
370,"Five Stars. Awesome book, blew my mind. You won’t regret taking the time to read this book.",2
371,great book with a lot of great information. while the story provides a great amount of information I feel that at times Gladwell dives a little more into the back story than needs he needs to.,1
372,"Gladwell does it again. I have read all of Malcom Galdwell's books. They are fascinating and engaging. His books are a series of different stories with a similar theme. I learned a LOT from his latest book ""The Outliers."" It contains secrets to success that actually make sense - the 10,000-hour rule was eye-opening. Wait until you read about WHY the best hockey players in Canada usually were born in the first three months of year.",1
373,Well written and almost impossible to put down.. Totally fascinating subject. Bought this after listening to the CD so I could pass it along to friends.,2
374,"Fascinating. The ideas proposed in this text seem revolutionary to how we generally view success. Though some facets may be a bit trite, like wealth and opportunity, the research and studies done to prove why these things among others are more likely to amount to success is incredibly intriguing. My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research. For an AP Psych summer reading book, I think it is a fantastic choice as it is interesting and thought-provoking as well as an easy and good read.",1
375,Disappointing Effort. I was incredibly excited to get my hands on Outliers after reading both Blink and Tipping point in years past. I often call Gladwell my favorite author.,0
376,interesting story about what came before. Really interesting story about what history has set up for us. However there were stories that ran too long and this detracted from the otherwise great idea of historical impact on current life.,1
377,Good. Quit good but not as much aspected,0
378,"Good except for Asian generalization. This book was very interesting and there is a lot of research to support the arguments made, except for the final section in the main book which tried to make some pretty broad claims about rice and entrepreneurial drive as the important reason for Asian skills with math. Recommend but keep your skepticism about some of the claims made.",1
379,"interesting concepts. Interesting concepts, good ideas but I felt it lacked a central theme.",1
380,"Compelling look at non-traditional factors for success. Gladwell succeeds by taking the tack of questioning widely held assumptions and beliefs around success and looking for other factors which contribute to success. Even though the explanations surrounding environment can cause us to pause, especially when the environmental factors can relate back to ethnic and socio-economic factors, they do create a thought-provoking vision.",1
381,"Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set .... Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set of evidence from different walks of life showing how we are conditioned by external circumstances. In the end still shows that talent and hard work still do matter - depending on circumstances you can get extraordinary results with what you get.",1
382,"overhyped and not very helpful. Not gonna lie, I had really high expectations for this book because it was highly recommended from all the reviews that I had read and from several friends that also told me it was very good. I was interested mainly because I thought it would be a self help/improvement book that had advice to apply to daily life, but instead I felt like each chapter was more of just providing factual stories and then having a conclusion at the end that I feel like were common sense or I already had learned through my own experiences from the past. The first few chapters were somewhat intriguing with the real life examples of successful people but then halfway through the book I already lost interest and was pretty disappointed in the content. I got pretty bored and finished the book just to finish it, not really because I wanted to.",0
383,They are lucky. Luck accounts for 90% of success.,1
384,"Culture can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",1
385,This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining. This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining! Serious success really comes down to luck of the draw.,1
386,Good book. So true,2
387,"Success Is Not Luck. This is a great read! Often in a conversation I'll bring up part of this book. I'm looking at success differently now. What would appear to be luck or coincidence is given support as a series of events that lead the individuals within a group to the success detailed. Hockey players, computer ""geniuses"", musicians, business people are all given the deep dive into what allowed them to be at the top of their different fields. The book is broken into chapters that can be read individually similar to a book of short stories. I read this over a long period of time and didn't lose anything by not picking it up daily or weekly.",2
388,wow. awesome book...well written...excellently researched...wow.,2
389,Five Stars. Good book,2
390,Interesting. Interesting and easy read. Very informative and puts a lot of perspective on some success stories but it generalizes and zones in on specific success stories.,0
391,"Interesting as usual. Gladwell always delivers a well thought out thesis, impeccable research and interesting details. Just did not agree with the conclusions he presents in the epilogue. To me his book proves just the opposite of his conclusins.",0
392,My new excuse for not making it to the NHL!. I found this book to be super interesting. Some of the facts and data are outstanding and really hit home for me.,0
393,"Good reading but 4 stars for 10k hour rule only. Excellent book, BUT remember the success is when you achieve what you want. Your legacy, genes, sex, gender, size are factors you should consider, but only the sky is the limit and your mind is your first obstacle. I disagree we some considerations from author about circumstantial conditions in advantage outliers have. I know people with nothing in his favor that have achieved success. The most important thing or concept is the 10k hrs rule 4 stars for that.",1
394,"Thought Provoking Read. More than once I thought of Acts 17:26 while reading Outliers. The NLT translation says, ""From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries."" God sets the time and place for us to be born, it is up to us to partner with him for our high calling to be fulfilled. Therein lies the Outlier secret.

402,Five Stars. great product,2
403,"Bite sized stories of success. My first Gladwell made me regret I'd waited so long to discover to discover this prolific author. His analysis of successful people was entertaining, humorous, and thoughtful. He did his best to have as global a perspective possible and to help the reader follow his train of thought. Can't wait to read more of his work!",1
404,"worst. Liked most of the book. The epilogue was misplaced, a little bit too wordy and repetitive. The goals of this book may be too idealistic but are worth working toward",0
405,Wonderful. Page quality ist good. Pages are too yellow .,1
406,a so so book. Not exactly what I was looking for. Good message but explained nothing new. Thought the message was going to be more deep. Easy to read.,0
407,"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",1
408,"Great Book, exceeded expectations. This book struck my interest based on the recommendation of a peer. The book itself reads smoothly, is well researched with lots of facts and statistics and the anecdotes within are informative and entertaining. The unique stories of Bill Gates, The Beatles and Canadian hockey all stars are all fascinating. I highly recommend picking this book up, it's a quick and informative read.",2
409,Better than the Talent code- both are worth reading.. As I read this book I kept saying these people are not outliers and then in the end Gladwell validates my suspicions!,1
410,"A solid book, great stories and was enjoyable to read the whole time.. I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.",1
411,Amazing. A classic,2
412,Packed Full of Great Information. This is a really interesting book! Full of valuable information! I read this for my book club and would highly recommend for others to do the same. After reading this you want a forum through which to discuss all the data that was shared.,2
413,"Homework.... This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman. The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise. As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read. It’s always refreshing to review the information presented in this book. If you haven’t already, add this text to your library.",2
414,Started off great then fell off a bit. Book started off great then fell off a bit. The first 150 pages or so was about relatable topics then it got into stuff that I didn't really care about. Very interesting premise and I will read Gladwell's other books.,1
415,"Very interesting, makes me think about doing things differently for my children. This book makes you think about what it takes to be an ""outlier"". It isn't all brains and charisma. Very interesting book with many real world examples of success and a detailed breakdown of how it was achieved.",1
416,"Well written by shallow - par for the course for Gladwell. I love him as a writer of magazine articles, he is funny, concise, and even enlightening. He is a great interview. But, as a writer of full length books, he is horribly shallow and delves into a subject about as lightly as possible. At least this book was not mind numbingly dumb like 'Tipping Point'. There was some interesting stuff here (though that might simply have to do with my own ignorance on the subject).",0
417,"CDs were Ok. I gave this 2 stars only because the CDs were fine. The case was torn, bent and misshapen.",0
418,Excellent Read. This is such a good read. Malcolm Gladwell is an exceptional author of high intelligence who has grown accustom to writing for the masses. He can make the most complex topic easy to understand for anyone who is able to read at an 8th grade level. Great book with excellent arguments.,2
419,"One of the I've read!. If success, opportunity, and privilege are themes that interest you, this book is for you. With entire chapters devoted to education, I encourage any teacher (especially math teachers) to pick this up and read it. I could not put it down. Highly recommend, it will change the way you see the world (and the way you see success)!",2
420,Great. Once I started with this book I couldn’t put it down. Very well researched and thought out. Highly recommend.,2
421,"Super interesting read!. Such great thoughts, and a very good writer. This book kept me engaged and intrigued with every story and example that led to the final brilliant conclusion.",2
422,good quick read. interesting with a different perspective on why certain people can thrive and be successful yet others seem to miss the boat,0
423,"Great insight, fun to read. I like Gladwell’s way of putting data and insights together, but in a fun and easy way. Read Blink and this. Will move to the next.",1
424,Another great read from Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great book for anyone trying to understand all of the factors that go in to a person becoming successful. As a teacher I wish I could have all of my students read it and understand what it takes to achieve greatness.,2
425,Very interesting. Opened my perspective about the world in a way like no other ! Never knew so many things in life lie beneath the surface and are beyond the obvious.,1
426,Incredible. I loved this book. I manage to read the whole book in one week. I couldnt put it down. Very interesting about different opportunities,2
427,"Fascinating theories. This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make ""greats"" great. The stories are fascinating, and worth a read. Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end. That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off. I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.",1
428,"Good read, but does not challenge the foundations. Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.",0
429,"but definitely a good read.. Hasn't made me a success yet, but definitely a good read.",2
430,"Great Book. Well worth the read, it's got some good information and is presented in an easy way.",2
431,"Your success IS down to luck, at least partly. A brilliant book by an incredible storyteller with a profound and powerful message: it’s time to stop the glorification of genius and talent, and recognise success for what it is - a mix of opportunity, culture, luck, commitment and hard work.",2
432,Five Stars. An excellent read!,2
433,Excellent book. Would highly recommend.. Excellent book. Would highly recommend.,2
434,"Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey .... 2/3 done the book. Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey references :) Has made me look at 'secrets of success' a little harder, and with a circumspection that I didn't have before.",1
435,"and could easily have been shorter. This book provides an interesting perspective on why some people achieve success while others of simiilar talent do not. It is repeaticous, however, and could easily have been shorter.",1
436,Great themes. Great themes yet I think this author could make the writing less extended,1
437,Five Stars. A great read,2
438,"A question of generalize what is learned. This book is very good and brings a new perspective towards our vision regarding successful people. However, it feels like it is forcing too much its vision because of a intrinsic limitation: it does not have the time or space to analyze every case of success in every area. So the book simply brings us a paradigm that we may believe it and search for ourselves, or not.",1
439,"Amazing. The best book I have ever read. Such an amazing mix of humour, adventure and life. Interesting from the first word",2
440,"Amazingly insightful. Just a remarkable book. Well researched and written, Gladwell makes you feel as though you are finding the answers to these questions and learning together. Highly recommend.",2
441,Five Stars. great book,2
442,Good Book. U will get more experience in Life. U can learn how to start new things in ur life. Best Book for learners.,1
443,"Five Stars. Fascinating, enlightening and in many ways reassuring. Well written and thought provoking. A very enjoyable read.",2
444,"and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I .... This book has fundamentally altered the course of my existence. I will remember this book and reference it whenever I can. I was forced to read it for class, and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I have read in my entire life this book has been the most inspiring. Many of the things in here are common sense. It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few. Greatness is in fact the reward of those who work hard. I read this book at exactly the right time in my life and would suggest it to anyone. I am an avid reader, but I have never enjoyed books presented to me in school until this book!",2
445,"Fascinating take on many modern topics. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's, but what a great intro. He takes a view of modern phenomenon and cuts to the heart of the issues which aren't the ones that you would expect. I particularly enjoyed the elements of cultural influence and how that influence persists over generations. I am practically applying the book by teaching my children numbers in Japanese as it could very well help them break down math more quickly.",2
446,"The good and the bad. Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.",0
447,Really enjoyable and easy to read book. Really enjoyable and easy to read book. A few big leaps and stretches but I didn't feel that it undermined Gladwell's ability to make you turn the microscope on your own life.,2
448,"You need to read this book!. Awesome book. A good mix of psychology, real life stories, history, and a feel good read. Finished it cover to cover in 4 days, I couldn’t put it down.",2
449,"kinda boring. high expectation for this book, but after reading half the book, i stopped. I felt like things were jumping around and many things are already obvious to me",0
450,Four Stars. Good Book,1
451,just incredible. I was riveted by this book and the amazing stats used to back up the author's claims. It has made me think very differently about my own life and that of my young child's.,2
452,Three Stars. Good.,0
453,"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",1
454,"One of the best books I've read. One of the best books I've read. I absolutely love the conclusions he draws, though he takes a little bit of liberty with his interpretation of the data. I totally agree with what he says, though. Inspiring, uplifting, and incredibly interesting. You do not want to miss this one.",2
455,Good. Good,1
456,"I do not like to read, but when I do I read ........ Loved the down to earth tone when talking about some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...",2
457,"not as good as the tipping point. book was OK but it amounts to ""practice makes perfect"". not as interesting as the tipping point.",0
458,Very insightful from start to finish.. Never has a book ever become so alive . We can all achieve more if we put in a little bit of effort .,2
459,"First 200 pages: fantastic; Last 150: mostly fillers. This is simply one of the best books I have read..for the first 200 pages. Unfortunately, the last 150 pages mostly wasted my time.",1
460,"My favorite Malcolm Gladwell book so far. Everything Malcolm Gladwell writes is a gem, but this one is amazing. He makes connections among people and events and demographics and cultural changes in a way no other author comes close to. The reader will learn a lot from this one and want more at the end. I learned a lot about myself as well as about this society we live in.",2
461,It was very interesting. I liked how the author related back to himself at the very end. Very well written and I enjoyed reading it.,0
462,"Luck or circumstances. Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.",1
463,"borrow the book from a friend. Gladwell knows how to hook interest, unearth some unusual facts and spin a good story. Look somewhere else for original, prize-winning ideas. Nothing new here about the topic of success.",0
464,Really good book!. I bought this book for a class. I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone now.,2
465,Good. Good,1
466,"Very easy to read. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
467,Great read. Amazing book. Well worth a read.,2
468,"An important book. This is not just a good book. This is an important book. One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.",2
469,Buy this book. Love this book!,2
470,Great book. Read this book for a writing class in college and love how Gladwell thinks no matter your background you can achieve success.,1
471,Great book. Fantastic read. Interesting sociological information presented in an accessible way.,2
472,"Good ideas, but lots of fluff.. The ideas are interesting, though some have been disproven. I wish he would have cut the length in half.",0
473,Pop Social Science.. The first and last Malcolm Gladwell book I will read.,0
474,"Informative, but conclusions are strange. This book outlines some interesting statistics and relationships, but conclusions the author draws seem very strange to me (promotes despair?)",0
475,Gladwell at his best..... Great book showing hard work trumps talent....,2
476,"A book that in a nutshell comes down to being .... A book that in a nutshell comes down to being born at the right time and/or place. For the rest, if you want to succeed, then you have to put in 10k hours of effort to become an expert in a particular subject.",0
477,"The Outliers. The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called ""Skillful Teaching""....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster. I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field. Not difficult or technical in the least :-)",1
478,Good information to know. I don't necessarily agree with success being tied to some of the things he mentioned in this book. The information is good to have but it isn't lifechanging.,0
479,Worthless. First 10 pages crushed. Seems like an old discarded product. Disappointed.,0
480,"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",1
481,Good Read!. Great book! I read it and passed it to a friend!,2
482,"This book will make you think!. So many interesting situations in this book, such as ""Why are Asian commercial airliners inherently more dangerous to fly?"" and ""Why are most National Hockey League players born in certain months?"" and ""Why did certain computer gurus achieve greatness while others did not""? Lots more situations to ponder as well",2
483,"quick read but how much did you really learn from it?. Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.",0
484,"Statistics can be made to prove anything. Although some of the ideas in this book are interesting to consider, my general feeling was that the author bent the information to fit his personal viewpoint. t did not come as a surprise to learn that being in the right place at the right time is a great advantage in life.",0
485,Must Read!. This book is part of a fantastic trilogy. Must read Blink and The Tipping Point....love Malcolm Gladwell.,2
486,love it!. must read! love it!,1
487,The book is original copy. The font size is bit small,1
488,"Worth Reading. I like Malcolm Gladwell, and this is probably his most applicable book -- it inspires and demonstrates his theories, rather than just explaining that they exist. I use it as a text in my AP Language class, and it is, by far, the kids' favorite read because it applies to their lives.",1
489,Required reading for college class. Required reading for college class,2
490,It's okay. Good product.,0
491,Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric .... Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric without being too learned for laymen to follow and grasp the concepts. I felt wiser having read this over a period of a few days.,2
492,"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",1
493,Amazing. Amazing quality. Amazing story.,2
494,"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",1
495,Five Stars. Good read.,2
496,"Very interesting.. Easy to read, informative. It explains a lot about how life 'happens' and develops by things that look like chance but are not really.",2
497,Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,2
498,Cover is very different. The cover is not as pictured in the advertisement. I am very disappointed. I had purchased this book before and it was stolen. Now the cover does not match the other 4 in the series.,0
499,"My dad recommended this guy. Almost sad at times, it completely dismantles the sentiment that success happens in a vacuum. Speaks at depth, without ever being boring or overly complex. Great read",2
500,"Great read that reviews a lot of Outliers and how they became such.. This was a fantastic read. It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing. Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing. Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.",1
501,Just O.K.. It was heavily used. It still had the post it notes in it. It was really quick shipping!,0
502,Five Stars. A PRESENT!,2
503,good but repetitive. Well written. But the chapters (at least the first few) are very long and repeat,0
504,Neat point of view! It really spoke to me .... Neat point of view! It really spoke to me and how I need to look at all the little details of situations and create outliers in my classroom.,1

507,Wonderfully Innovative. The research and conversational writing make this a wonderful must read. It will be particularly interesting for parents and educators.,1
508,Pretty good. Good book. Great writer,1
509,WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,2
510,"Thought provoking. The main thesis of the book is interesting and thought provoking. There are, I believe, many other factors to consider regarding what makes an Outlier the successful person they are. Environment, and opportunities for growth and development are crucial, that is true. I would also give ample credit to the Outlier's ability to be causative in their environment, and to find or even create opportunities for themselves. All of these factors and more will cumulatively create the outcome. A great book for a book club discussion!",1
511,It's a good book.. It's a good book. A different perspective for sure. Sometimes the author will do a little bit of stretching but I believe it was important so he coudl get his point across. Worth reading.,1
512,"Depressing, not inspiring. While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas. For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.",0
513,It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Words won’t do justice to this book! It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s so informative and easy to read while packing in so much interesting information.,2
514,"Excellent read!. So very interesting and insightful, I’ll be thinking of this book long after it’s read - a truly captivating book!",2
515,"I don't know about Malcolm Gladwell. I've read 3 of his books. All of them fine, but nothing special. All of them fairly superficial with nothing original or innovative. I think his books are very pop culture and should be read in the time frame (say within a year) that they are published. Too long after that and they become stale, not prolific or prescient. Gladwell is a very good and interesting writer, but I don't think his books have much depth or staying power.",0
516,"Truly superb. I finally read it and I find it to be everything everyone has said it is. Totally absorbing, ""Can't put it down"" reading, and staggeringly informative. TEN stars!",2
517,"Gladwell is a genius. Malcolm Gladwell is uniquely gifted in being able to first identify common assumptions and beliefs of social importance that are in fact questionable, then to make inspired connections that build a case for a contrarian perspective, and finally to present the evidence in a totally compelling, non-patronising and inspirational way. I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance. We should treasure visonaries and communicators like Malcolm Gladwell.",2
518,Eye opening. A must read for new parents. Makes you realize how important it is to take advantage of every opportunity and that hard work does have its rewards.,1
519,Highly recommended. Excellent,2
520,"Great book, very deep and relative to society now.. I gave this to my Marines as a gift, for earning a promotion. Certainly a great read. I recommend any newly promoted Marine to read it as well as any young man and woman.",2
521,"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",1
522,Five Stars. Item as described and fast delivery,2
523,"Robin's ""Outliers"" Review. ""Outliers"" is a thought provoking book discussing the events and environments that came together to give certain people the opportunity to be big successes, ie, the Bill Gates and Beatles of the world. It also discusses the reason why other people that should have been huge successes did not reach there potential.",1
524,"Great Stories, with a point. MG is a great story teller which makes you not want to put the book down - and the stories have a point - bonus! Great insights into success and failure. Wish he had explored the cultural ""background"" aspects more. This read also offers very practical parenting and coaching tips for bringing out the best in people, although they obviously aren't labelled as such.",2
525,"Forget statistics. Read it for what it is.. I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.",2
526,"Outliers: a must read!. When success is discussed and debated, this book will be its primer. Insightful and observant look at the cultural and human characteristics that affect our lives.",2
527,A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a .... A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a lot of myths and is also an interesting read on how some people have become extremely successful through luck and perseverance.,2
528,Five Stars. Right on time. 5/5,2
529,"Eye opening. This book goes deeper inside the nature vs. nurture, predestination vs free will argument more comprehensibly than any other book or scholar I have ever come into contact with. Malcolm Gladwell shows that success is a combination of luck and fate as well as development of skill and practice. If one is born into dire circumstances, will they succeed? Is fostering a talent more important that taking a abnormal interest in a subject the key to success? This book is a must have for a western civilization preoccupied with what the deserve over what they should work for.",2
530,Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was .... Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was happy to add to my personal library again. I recommend Caldwell's OUTLIERS to everyone.,2
531,Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,1
532,excellent book. Logical and engaging walkthrough of facts about successful people over the last few hundred years. Started devolving into feelings and hearsay in the last chapters.,1
533,"To sum it up, you can be lucky, or not. I enjoyed listening to the book, however, in the end, Gladwell concludes that an outlier for success is heavily determined by opportunities given to us from the moment we were born. This strikes little hope for those who want to be successful but weren't lucky enough to be born into an environment capable of guiding them to success.",1
534,"good book. Really enjoying it so far. You have to be able to ""think outside the box"" to get the full impact.",1
535,"Interesting theory. I don't think he adequately proved his hypohesis, but it is interesting reading. It DOES give one food for thought and conversation - if not necessarily convincing one of the accuracy of his conclusion.",0
536,Those who think they are outliers should read this. Ought to be required reading for every Prep Boarding School.,1
537,Worth the money. page quality is good but its cover pages looks a little damaged. Please take care of the products you deliver. We are paying to get fresh and new products. Thankyou.,1
538,"Absolute Genius. This is the first book I read for Malcom Gladwell, and I am impressed. The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",2
539,"Excellent book. Outliers is an intriguing book of ten distinct stories of how more than just intelligence and hardwork helped people to become outliers in their professions. The book explores the backgrounds of athletes, software developers, and lawyers plus many more. It is a great read and a great gift for others.",2
540,"Another article turned into a book. This is yet another article turned into a 300 page book. Only the first two chapters are worth a read. The author writing style is boring, repetitive, and predictable. This author is clearly over-rated.",0
541,Here is my animated review!,1
