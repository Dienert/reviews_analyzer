"A great read and worth every penny!. My first Malcolm Gladwell book and definitely not my last. The book does a great job analyzing talent and success, and the seemingly minor or unnoticed entites that play a large part in determining the disposition of a person. There are a million reviews on this book but I feel it was well written and very entertaining; I found myself not wanting to stop reading! 'Outliers' will be a book that will not just sit and collect dust. This was a great book and great purchase.",2
"Senior English. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School. For our English class this year, we read Outliers: The Story of Success. Outliers seemed like the perfect book to evaluate our essential question; to what extent do time and place define a person? The purpose of having an essential question is to promote greater levels of thinking, which, in turn allows us to evaluate situations with a new perspective that looks beyond the obvious. The information presented in Outliers was perfect for our English course because it evaluated each situation with a deeper outlook. For instance, instead of coming to the conclusion that Korean pilots are naturally inclined to crash planes, the book evaluated reasons such as Power Indexes, and different cultures' tolerance for ambiguity. It is logical process of evaluating all aspects of a situation before jumping to conclusion that makes Outliers relevant to our course of study. hile reading the book, I found some of the presented answers to be illuminating while I found others to be overly general. For instance, Chapter 2 discussed the 10,000-Hour Rule, which I found to be rather interesting because it explained why people like Bill Gates are successful. Many of us often wonder what it takes to be next Bill Gates and I found it surprising that the answer is practice. My dad, like most parents, is always telling me that practice makes perfect. I've always found it hard to believe that practice is all it takes but I have to admit that, after reading Outliers, it does make sense. When I used to play violin, I found that the best violinists were the ones who practiced a lot. They were the ones that took lessons early in their childhood and as a result, they are able to accumulate many practice hours. However, I am glad you pointed out that other factors like opportunity and time play a role in determining success. he chapter that I found most insightful was Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, in which you discussed a theory on why Asians are so good at math. As an Asian, I was really glad that you chose to address this topic because many of my friends subscribe to the misconception that Asians are naturally good at math. I have always wondered; why exactly are Asians good at math but time after time, I have failed to procure a reasonable answer. I was almost convinced that maybe Asians are just naturally good at math when I read your book. I found it rather interesting that there was a correlation between hard work in the rice paddies and one's ability to do math. Reflecting back, it makes perfect sense because those in my school who are the best at math are the ones who don't give up. I was also surprised that you related math and language. I tested your theory that the Chinese language makes it easier to memorize numbers, by asking my dad to repeat numbers in Chinese and it turns out that he could remember them. On the other hand, I could not when I repeated the numbers in English. (Cont. on next review)",1
"Outliers - Gladwell - A Good Tour of the Outer End of Normality. I read the book as it is on a reading list for my job. It is an easy read and I caution you about the actual science behind it; we readers just swallow some things without checking. However, it is, like many of his books, a good tour of the subject and worthy of our time.",1
Five Stars. I like Malcolm Gladwell books.,2
"A Different Perspective on the Nature of Success. I have read both of Gladwell's previous books, and this one is another fascinating achievement. The book reads much like his other books, Blink and The Tipping Point, with some overarching themes and a lot of interesting examples, data, and narratives.",2
"An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and .... An ""outlying"" point of view of events, personalities and circumstances that have shaped our world, our nation and our fortunes. Well worth reading.",2
"3rd time I read/ listened to this.. great material. my only issue with it is the fact that even if the greatest, rarest opportunities and circumstances become available to someone very few will run with them and stick to it for at least 10000hrs. that's the critical component that's lacking in this book.",1
Why is it rated so high?. This book is just a bunch of stories. There is less than 10% of useful information in it. I couldn't finish it.,0
"Interesting research in a readable format. I have read several Gladwell books but this is my favorite. The idea of what components create ""successful"" people gave me much to think about as a classroom teacher. Gladwell looked at success from a variety of angles and presented his information in a clear, well written style. I gave copies to friends as I found it so interesting.",2
"Outliers: The Story of Deceit. This book was a novel I had to read for class. While I am one who believes success can be attained through hard work, there are other factors that play into success, such as talent. Gladwell tries to dispel this, but in the process places himself in a corner. He claims talent is a small pool, and then uses a small pool that are not talented to argue against. Unless it is an overwhelming majority, there is no basis for argument.",0
"Great read. Galdwell is one of the premiere authors and presents such interesting facts in story form. This book made me realize how lucky some people get such a Gates being born at the right time. But it is not all luck. His 10,000 hour rule is the biggest takeaway I came out with. I highly recommend this for all people, especially adults with young kids.",2
Interesting Read. Interesting read but why do I have to write this Amazon? I am just looking to read for a few minutes to elevate my insomnia and this is not helping.,1
Good insight but very boring. The insight was interesting but I found that this was just an exposition into different lives and jumped around too much. There was very little story or anything to keep me entertained and I had to force myself to finish this book.,0
Five Stars. One of my favorite books ever - sent this off on a book-donation-gig.,2
A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a .... A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a lot of myths and is also an interesting read on how some people have become extremely successful through luck and perseverance.,2
An interesting and easy listen. The reasons for success are really quite incredible as evidenced by the research that Malcolm Gladwell has done. I chose this book because my sons (in their mid twenties) told me it was great. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. I think listening to this book would probably be easier than reading it because of the statistical information. Not one to read this type of book (prefer fiction and escapism) I expected to be bored but I was intrigued. It was even more interesting that it was read by Malcolm Gladwell himself. I would highly recommend this book.,1
"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",1
Great condition.. It seems people are only reviewing the actual story not the product. I bought the paper back and it’s in great condition.,2
Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,0
Eye Opening and Thought Provoking. One of those books everyone should read. A different way of looking at things we all assume we know all about already.,2
"Excellent use of examples and data. This nonfiction piece was the required reading for students taking AP Language in the fall at our local high school. I read it so I could work with a young girl I mentor.As a former high school English teacher, I found it very engaging- a difficult task for non fiction writers. My teen reader also liked it.",1
Boring. Very boring,0
Outliers allows us to take a deeper look at the ingredients of success. In outliers we are exposed to the various factors that have contributed to the successes of a diverse set of individuals. It highlights the fact that no one is successful solely on the basis of their own work or talent. It exposes the true story behind success.,2
Not what I expected. I had seen this title recommended by a few sources and thought I should give it a try.,2
Really interesting text. Well written,2
Five Stars. A PRESENT!,2
A good buy.. Well documented and presented analysis of research on outliers.,2
"Outstanding, love every chapter. Hooked from day one, was not familiar with the author and now I understand why he keeps hitting home runs, every book is a best seller, cannot put it down.",2
"Thought provoking. This is one of those books that at least five people tell you to read and you don't until years later, then you realize it's brilliant.",1
Great service from the seller. Fantastic customer service and a great product,2
"Good read. This is an interesting book. It seems to be well researched and the referenced studies are incorporated into the text very naturally. It's not a difficult book to read, and if you had a long journey coming up I'd recommend this book as a travel companion.",1
Outliers. Interesting facts to keep in mind for having more opportunities in life. Specially that we can improve with our efforts,1
"Interesting Stories and Ideas. Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas. Not sure I agree with it all. The author is great and is an excellent writer. I will read more books from this author. The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great. All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books. A very enjoyable read!",1
Must read. It's a must read. MG is articulate and crafts his thoughts without rambling on and saying the same thing over and over. He doesn't say the same thing twice. He says what he needs to and gets to the point. Each point is unique and supports the main idea. Very little repetition in this book.,2
"Interesting. Love the book. Fascinating from cover to cover. Makes me rethink a few things. Luck is a big contributor to success. Turns out 10,000 hours and a number of other things, even going back generations and culture are also at work. Loved it.",2
"Sucess analysed like never before. Malcom Gladewell uses amazing insights and showcases how individual success is a function of ' being at the right place, at the right time'.",0
Bounce now outliers. Another fascinating insight into the story of success. I first read Bounce which roused my curiosity on success and now Outliers further provides evidence that hard work and a great amount of luck can determine future success. As a teacher and sports coach these two books have had a profound affect on my thinking and therefore my work.,2
The title is the best part. I was disappointed with this book and considering stopping a few pages into it and returning the darn thing.,0
Five Stars. excellent,2
"Gladwell gives us more food for thought. As in ""Blink"" and his other books, Gladwell gives us a lot to think about, using a number of examples, this time including The Beatles, Bill Gates, and South Korean pilots. His basic thesis is that, while most successful people are smart and hardworking, the ""outliers"" are those who have been given the opportunity to work very hard and get the 10,000 hours of practice that is required to be very, very good at something.",2
"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",1
Great book. Suberb writing,2
"Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is. This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view. As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages. It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",1
Interesting thoughts. Which sound convincing. In India we often see lives transformed based on this critical opportunity. Have seen many brilliant careers subdued cause of a lack of exposure a sense of entitlement that many don't have.,1
Best read ever. Extremely grateful to the author for this wonderful book,2
"Superman Might Not be so Super. I like that this book took a different approach to those that seem to rise above the rest. Gladwell did not glorify, rather, brought them back down to the ground for us to see. It actually follows suit with thoughts on who you surround yourself with and being at the right time in the right place. It isn't the individual as much as having access to the opportunity and proper support. Superman isn't super without his powers nor did he himself create his powers. The one rub with this book is the narration. Gladwell has this sinister tone that would be good as a villain in a1920s detective story or a Batman villain.",1
great book. So many things to discover and learn about. The curiosity of Gladwell is amazing and gets you as excited as he is about it,2
Five Stars. This is the best book I have ever read fantastic,2
"why some succeed and some do not. I , having a mid year birthday, made note of those born in January and also those in December and that the year's difference in age made a difference in their schooling. I have also done some ethnic profiling, noting in a general way that ethnicity can influence what may be termed aptitudes. Of course, any book which supports one's own views is going to get rave reviews from its readers. It is certainly worth a read.",2
Fascinating. This is so right on! I never realized the advantages or disadvantages of when you were born had so much to do with your life outcome. Of course if you were born during the depression you wouldn't question that premise. But in today's time it is still very applicable. This is a book you want to keep on the shelf.,2
"Highly recommend!. Incredibly interesting variety of stories that come together perfectly. Very well thought out, clear and concise. We'll researched and covers some topics very often brushed over. Excellent read.",2
Three Stars. OK,0
Four Stars. Gladwell is fun reading.,1
"A book packed with interesting and unusual information. After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.",2
"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",1
"Culture's Role ... More than you think. Outstanding insight. I'd heard about the ""10,000 hours"" to achieve mastery, now I understand it. His explanation of the role cultural background plays in our society explains what I could never figure out.",2
quality. Good stuff,0
Great book!. GREAT BOOK! A must read for everyone.,1
Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable. I found myself repeating much of his findings and points in everyday conversation about success. Highly recommend and am continuing to read more by him.,2
"Some Great Insights. I was a big fan of Galdwell`s first two books, the Tipping Point, and Blink.",1
.. Nice!,2
"Success looks very different to me now.. I find myself wondering how a life might be different every time I encounter someone with ability or passion that is untapped, if only they had been exposed to a wider range of opportunities.",1
"The Unexpected Ingredients of Success. Success can often be related to something other than being the smartest or the best at something, it may have often to due with when you are born in a year or at a time in history. Gladwell makes those points in this work, while it is not an exhaustive look at success, it does point out some of the less known factors that contribute to ones success.",1
The Truth Is Outlier. This is my first non-fiction review.,0
Great syorytelling. I really enjoyed this book. The style of storytelling used was captivating making what would normally be a very dry subject interesting. I learned some very interesting things about success and the role of our environment in that success. I also find myself looking at successful people differently.,2
Good book.. It's interesting. I'm only reading it for class.,0
"Inspiring. I found this book extremely interesting - about how success is earned and not just for the fortunate few. Once I had stopped listening, I couldn't wait to pick up on it again.",1
Five Stars. Looking forward to this read!,2
Incredible reading- highly recommended. Keeping this very short but has given me a new fresh perspective on how great intelligence comes about...the key ingredient being time!,2
Five Stars. really interesting.,2
Three Stars. gift,0
Didnotnlive to the expectations. If u expect it's going to be as good as the tipping point and daivd and goliath you're going to be disappointed. He has good points an ideas but it doesnt live up to the expectations,0
Different!. Show me a point of view that I havent realized.,1
What Separates Us from Most. This book was fascinating. Outliers helps us to understand that we have been shaped by circumstances beyond our control. It promotes the idea that we may not be where we are if our ancestors had been different or if some other factor in our lives had not happened to make our world much different. This is a very interesting book that I think anyone would enjoy reading.,2
"Yet another good book from Malcolm Gladwell!. It is commonly believed that people become successful after ""working hard"" for a long time and then success happens! Although hard work is a success factor, there are many other variables that have much more influence on success. Gladwell presents real life stories and much background to demonstrate that success mostly come from factors such as: when someone is born, their ""ethnicity"", their family heritage, their geographic location, and circumstances (i.e. luck). Some or all of these factors combined with hard work made individuals or groups of people highly successful. His examples are great and support his key message.",1
"This book will make you dumber.. Seriously, the worst thing about this book is that is sounds intelligent, but it is really stupid.",0
"ADDING PERSPECTIVE: Gladwell's expertise. As always, Malcolm Gladwell has presented a new perspective on looking at our social environment. Assumptions and lore are rebutted by practical observation and objectivity.",2
"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",1
Three Stars. didn't read the book. so gave it midway review,0
"simple but powerful. Why do some people achieve great things? It's not all to do with talent, there are so many other factors that make this possible. This book looks at why some people do well and what other factors are involved",2
"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.",1
Great topic. The students were excited to get this book.,2
Familar but Different (Another Good Read). If you enjoyed his other book this is very much in the same style and quality. It was thought provoking and enjoyable in the same way Blink and Tipping were without relying on reiterating parts of his past books.,1
"good book describing what it takes to become really successful. This is a book which would change your notions about success. Most people have the belief that hard work alone could make you successful. But, in this book, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the underlying factors which have an indirect influence on success.",1
Factors in success.. I loved this book. It is so fascinating; there are ideas about success that I had never considered. There are certain situations that need to be in place before success can happen. The most interesting aspect is the fact that success is not ONLY dependent on the person's ability and intellect. There are many other factors.Read the book and be intrigued!,2
Enjoyed and learned a lot. This book has amazing details about how a person becomes an outlier. I learned this is not only a matter of hard work but also luck has a lot to do with it. The luck which starts many years before the outlier becomes an outlier.,2
"Good read. This book was great to read, and had some interesting ideas, but the gist of the book is: success is more about the circumstances surrounding a person than the actual qualities of that person. The author sets it up nicely but in the end, it kind of feels like: ""Duh!""",1
"everyone with a goal should read this. great read, very inspiring. Can relate and find little things to help you succeed.",2
!!!!. TO READ!!! JUST TO IT,2
A true inspiration. This gives you lots of thought about life and gives you understanding about how to pursue a successful future and confidence to try your hardest to achieve things,2
"Book Great - Amazon's vendor disappointed me. Malcolm Gladwell is a most intelligent writer who presents his thoughts, opinions and factual results of various events and research for reaching the conclusions he presents in this and his other books.",2
"Exceptional: Much Better and With Greater Breadth Than Anticipated. It took me a long time to pick up a copy of Outliers to read. I had read many of the print media reviews when the book came out and most, unfortunately, focused on the role of birth month on one's ""success."" I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.",2
Interesting Points But Overly Broad Assertions & Racist Postulations. I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.,0
Instant Fascination. Just received today and sped through the first 10% already! Fascinating read that changes how you view the world in less than 30 pages.,2
"Fiction. The ""Story"" of Success is a good title. There is a great deal of ""storytelling"" done in the book. Mr. Gladwell attempts to strictly correlate success and circumstance. If you weren't born at the right time, or if you did not have unfettered access to some new whiz bang phenomenon or if you didn't have the right heritage or the right group of friends, than the mediocrity of your performance is not your fault. A grand example of when correlation does not equal causation.",0
"Perhaps my book of the year 2020. Reminds of Yuval Noah Harari in a way it's written: simple, informative, clever.",2
"Interesting Read. Very entertaining read. Read it all on a 5 hour flight. I would recommend for those looking for a quick read. The main theme of the book is opportunity (which apparently, we as individuals have no control over) meets preparation and hard work.",1
"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",1
Easy to read.. Loved it.,2
Thinking out of the box. Malcolm Gladwell is an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the world in a non-traditional way. He challenges your assumptions and gets you to think. I like that in a book. I end up penciling a lot of questions and comments in the book margins as I read Gladwell. We have been talking in our family about the ideas in this book for weeks. This book definitely sparks discussion.,1
"Great listen. I love listening to Malcolm Gladwell books for the same reasons most people do. At the risk of sounding picky or blind to the fact that this is a great book, I don't think it's Gladwell's best. The Tipping Point and David & Goliath both had an amazing stickiness for me, where it's been a over week since finishing this and haven't been thinking about it as much. I STILL think about The Tipping Point all the time.",1
"Another article turned into a book. This is yet another article turned into a 300 page book. Only the first two chapters are worth a read. The author writing style is boring, repetitive, and predictable. This author is clearly over-rated.",0
"Too long. My interest was held. In success, opportunity, cultural inheritance and hard work play key roles.",0
Fantasticky interesting. East to read.,2
Understanding the foundation of one's success. I wished I'd have known this information when my wife and I were raising our small children. I'm inspired to think about and share my thoughts about how I succeeded in my life (to whatever extent I did) with my adult kids and their children and maybe they will take it from there for their children.,2
"Different but interesting. The concept of the book is understood, the examples were good and it did generate ideas to correlate to life as well as ones potential success goals.",0
Read the first few chapters. The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell,0
GOOD READ!. Book came on time and in a good condition. I loved reading this book! Author is a genius. It is about factors of success in America.Such an eye opener.,2
Motivational. I truly enjoyed this book and have recommended it several times.,2
"This isn't a new story for scholars, but it is a great presentation of it.. There is plenty of research in the field of resiliency that tells us that children who survive and thrive despite extraordinary difficulties do so because of some element in their external environment that worked in their favor. The disappointment: super heroes they are not. The good news: average people can step in and make a difference. Very good news indeed. While scholars might not find much meat to chew on here, anyone outside the field will love it. And it reinforces my belief that all scholarly topics should be edited by a top journalist - hate to say it (sorry to my people!) but for enjoyment's sake, I much prefer reading a journalist's book on a scholarly topic than a academic's book. Gladwell's a great writer, and unless this is your field, you're not only going to enjoy reading the book, you'll learn a lot too!",1
"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",1
"Please only focus on the facts of this book. It's a struggle to listen through his overgeneralized narrative on the statistical data. the facts the writer puts together is amazing to know, but the way he puts it is so unbearable to listen through. I hope he could clarify/ assure from time to time that he 'doesn't mean that everybody born/doesn't possess the outlying traits that he described are bound to be doomed, but just statistically less advantaged.' Please do not takes his word literal and do process if u are looking for life advice. I hope all readers knows better and are not misled after listening to the heavily biased topics, that daytoday reality does not operates statistically. Please only focus on the facts of this book and avoid taking his comments on the events word to word.",0
Fantastically interesting and compelling book. I originally purchased the audible version of this book but I found it so compelling that I purchased a hard copy as well. It's easy to read and relevant to anyone. I would recommend this to anyone.,2
"Has promise, but fell short. When I ordered this book I thought it definitely had the potential to be an interested read - and it was. I dont disagree with the idea that some of the theories in this book could actually work, but the way the author went about proving them really threw me. As a scientist it is blatantly obvious when people are manipulating statistics. The author seemed to be cherry-picking numbers to fit his model, which is unfortunate because many of these models probably do work, he just went about showing that in the wrong way.",0
"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",1
Interesting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have been a fan of Gladwell since reading Tipping Point. Interesting the points that he makes regarding the impact of historical events on the individuals within the book.,2
Inspirational. I really enjoyed this book and will purchase all Malcolm Gladwell's literary work.,2
Highly recommended. I love Malcolm Gladwell. And this book is yet another example of why.,2
A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,1
"Five Stars. amazing read, everybody needs to read this book!",2
"Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on .... Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing a book essentially on LUCK! This book has changed my world! As a hard worker, there were times when I didn't understand why my hard work didn't produce success, or that it would take so long to see results...but now I understand very clearly that sometimes it's just a matter of waiting for LUCK to show up and being prepared when it does!",2
"Changes the way you look at success.. Nice to see some scientific research on what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours of practice is the key.",1
"Fascinating book!. I found the stats very fascinating! I am not done with the book yet, but I am excited to see how it ends.",1
"Highly recommended. I'm a big M. Gladwell fan and I enjoy reading of his research. It's definitely a great read if you have kids or are considering. It's a book full of stories about successful people and failures as well to teach us to look outside the box when we judge people who are ""outliers"" in our society. Very interesting!",2
"Good book. I enjoyed this book, but got lost a few times with all of the statistics. :) I'm glad I was able to stick it out, because it does have some great information on what it takes to be an outlier.",1
Couldn't put it down!!!. Every review was accurate with 5 stars for this fascinating and captivating read!,2
"I thought I would be bored with it as I tend to read mostly fiction .... One of the most insightful books I have ever read!! Everyone should read it, especially anyone in education!! I thought I would be bored with it as I tend to read mostly fiction but my interest was peaked with each new discovery in his research!",2
"this book tells us that we all have equal talents. this book heavily discredits innate ability and genetics. 10,000 hours of practice is heavily flawed. I will not recommend this book.",0
A review of Outliers. A Review of Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell,1
"Good start, blah finish. I thought the start of the book was pretty neat...hockey players getting an advantage because of their birthdays, entrepreneurs who benefited tremendously from external circumstance, etc was a good story. And he applies it to a larger social message that since increased opportunities are what help cause these positive outliers we should focus on providing as many opportunities as possible. He kind of lost me in the second half of the book though. I'm not from the South but some of that was borderline offensive. And while the stats may show Asian students are better at math, I'm not convinced that patience with rice paddies is really the reason.",0
Good theory but poor writing. The book presents different but very convincing views towards things about success we thought we get used to and we thought we well understood. It makes me rethink what exactly makes a person succeed. That's a very good lesson to myself and also child raising.,1
Good!. Very interesting!,1
"Gladwell makes you think. If you don't want to just 'consume' books and you enjoy inspiring thoughts, Gladwell won't disappoint you. He is using illustrative examples from real world, easy to remember, easy to believe.",1
"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2
Fascinating study of the various causes of success. Outliers is a fascinating book. The people you are introduced to by Malcolm Gladwell and the remarkable events that create the environments that result in their success or failure are amazing to comprehend. It also helps that outliers is quite well written too.,2
Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I .... Excellent jsut like all the previous Malcolm Gladwell books I have read thus far.,2
"Nice reminder, too narrow.. Outliers: the one sided story of success.",1
"It Makes Sense. Gladwell has statistics that make sense about how achievement happens. It really is much about effort and hard work, though!",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze .... I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is difficult to analyze why and how distinguished people are so brilliant and superior, but the way that Gladwell presented his points gave a logical and tangible understanding of the abstract concept of success. (Also, the amount of research he did is astonishing.)  recommend this book to everyone!",1
"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",2
Great product and service!. Great product and service!,2
Great read!. Fabulous book and one of my All-time favorites.,2
"but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers. This is an interesting book. I had never read ant of Gladwell's books, but did enjoy his analysis of high achievers in Outliers.",0
A rational and sober explanation of events which might otherwise seem miraculous. Provides accessible insight and great clarity without the need for grandiose language or overly complex analogies. Gladwell states his case with style and grace. Both informative and entertaining - worth the money.,1
HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book. Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221; My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work. The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other. Well how does the author know this? Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates? To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control). Fun book. I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,1
I AM IN LOVE with this book. I absolutely love this book. It makes so much sense. Common sense things that I know but it is explained so beautifully/ perfectly in this book. This is one of the greatest books of my life and I love reading it. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing it.,2
"Re-frame your concept of success. Highly informative book. I love the way Gladwell makes you rethink what you think you know about success. As a former athlete it was interesting to turn the lens onto myself and figure out where I was on my journey. Read it. I will say this, don't be afraid to breeze through some paragraphs or sections when you've gotten the picture.",1
"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",1
"Great idea in the book but not a full explanation of outliers. I liked the book until the very last bit where the author starts summarizing the book as those with more privilege than others. Although I agree with this point of view to an extent , it is not the full story. The truth is privilege is a factor but not the only variable in successful. Effort & focus are better predictors of success because any person has control over those. Just saying people are privileged if they’re successful doesn’t help anyone in fact it hurts society by instilling doubt in the individual due to his lack of privilege.",1
Fast paced. Book moves quickly and the short stories used to describe these concepts were interesting and enlightening.,1
Brilliant examples - would love more obscure ones too. All of the examples were eye opening and yet oddly predictable. The way he wrote was addicting and easy to digest. I would love a book by him on agriculture and farmers/ farmer suicides.,1
Four Stars. Good book,1
Best Book!. Best book ever!,2
"Interesting concepts. 10, 000 hours, honor, .... Interesting concepts. 10,000 hours, honor, gives a different view of human behavior.",1
Changed my perception of success!. A great book for motivation,2
"Very interesting. Gladwell posits that the root cause of someone like Bill Gates isn't merely that he is a highly motivated and hard working genius. In order to rise as high as he did, he needs to be lucky. With Gates, it was his high school giving him access to a computer and then allowing him to spend a semester as an intern.",1
Five Stars. it was a gift,2
"Pessimistic Excuses To Demotivate Everyone. The author is basically arguing that all phenomenally successful people are products of the privilege and luck! While there is some validity to his argument, it clearly devalues hard work and effort. It’s so ignorant! It tries to blame culture and community you were brought up in for your successes and failures. It’s so pessimistic and miserable! It’s a waste of time.",0
Outstanding. This author clearly has a gift of drawing together diverse academic studies and weaving them into a narrative that is at once simple and complex. He succeeds in giving us a powerful picture of what makes people succeed.,2
A bit forced. I must admit that the author probes all what he said. But some analisys sound a bit unnatural for me....,0
"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",0
"A good read for a day on the beach. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and his anecdotal based style is certainly entertaining. I learned something new from this book, which I read on the beach in Croatia. I missed a vision with the book. Now that we know these relationships that Malcolm has showed us then what are we going to do to make the world a better place. Anyway, the book is worthwhile reading.",0
What a horribly boring book for a teenager. I only purchased this book for one of my high school kids. What a horribly boring book for a teenager.,0
Three Stars. As expected,0
"Hurrah for Gladwell. Every book by Gladwell is a gem. This is no exception. Just read ""Blink"" .... a must-have in anyone's",2
"Interesting theory but not totally accurate. I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory. I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.",1
"Interesting read. I enjoyed the book, I especially liked the stories regarding Bill Gates and also the commonality of plane cranes.",1
"Great insight and the stories to prove it. This book was a pleasure to read. The thought progression was clear and easy to follow. The points were made by interesting stories and human examples that kept you wanting more. The points from how to become an expert, to how that expertise is used is clear and insightful. Malcolm Gladwell made his case and proved it well.",1
"Great book. This book really gives you the opportunity to see outliers from another perspective, more realistic more human, thanks to that, you can change your mind and see the world with the eyes of hope.",2
"Great listen. Intriguing, interesting and fascinating! This books makes one aware of how important the environment, culture and timing is to a person's success. well put together , a must read/listen.",1
"Back To The Past. That's the most appropriate title I can think of for this great piece of science. In a nutshell, Gladwell illustrates how important our past and enviornment plays in how and what we do as we mature. This is a brilliant but simple expose on what all the genius stuff is all about. No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders. Its all about the parents. We are the creators of our own children's destiny. And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG! its us. No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it? its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are. I love all the case study stories--they're really interesting--of those whom have risen above and succeeded. And I love the fact that ""Outliers"" says We Can!!! Plain and simple. Great book",2
"A read to remember. The beauty of Outliers is it's detailing. Malcolm Gladwell take you through a journey a amazing revelations with analysis, data, history. The way each of his ideas unfold is mind-blowing. The chapters that involves plane crashes, asian maths, the 10000 hour rule, concerted cultivation are something to ponder on for a long time.",2
"not bad. Wasnt easy reading! If someone read this that didnt have much of an education they would have difficulties. However, for me content was good and informative.",0
"About successful people, not real outliers. Was disappointed there was no discussion of iconoclasts.",0
"A great read!. I love Malcolm Gladwell's writing style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book very much and could not put it down. I like how he sets up a sequence of events in a story that is full of facts and perceptions, that by the time he gets to the juicy stuff, I have already been intrigued and ready to learn something else I did not know about people and success. Thanks!",2
"Practical and always good for a second read!. Malcom Gladwell’s style of writing and practical creative example is what made me read this book again. Its just tickle some thoughts, memories or failure where it boost you for a forward and positive thinking. Love it! All the respect . Namaste",2
Five Stars. Great insight into success. Quite a revelation and once you know it kind of seems obvious. Would recommend.,2
"Four Stars. Good read, interesting stats, conclusions may not be fully accurate, variety of outliers helps reader see similarities.",1
Awesome read. Brilliantly written....,1
Nicely written about outliers. Very well written book covering many aspects in a outliers life. Nothing crazy exciting information in this book but well worth a read.,1
Four Stars. Good read,1
"Fascinating. I enjoyed reading this book and it's study of the ""self made man""/genius myth very much. A fascinating insight drawn from the author's personal experience and background.",1
Great!. Not finish reading it yet. But so far so good.,2
"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I Believe his theory on 10,000 hours makes sense to me. I highly recommend thid book.",2
Eye opener. Simply amazing and eye opener.,2
"Good but fairly general info.... This book was recommended to me by a professor of mine. It has a lot of good/interesting information in it but I'm not 100% certain that all the thoughts in this book are well laid out or at least aren't described thoroughly enough to convince me. I would still consider it a good read, like most of Gladwell's material.",0
Freaking Awesome. One of the best books I have read that offers an interesting and relevant approach to some of society's common issues that affects how people view success. It humanises the Socias sciences. I had my 13 year old daughter read it which allowed her to gain confidence in her ability to become better in the activities she wishes to put the effort into.,2
"Not what i expected at all. Basically a lot of long winded stories, often making it hard to find how it ties into the sunject mater, to get his simple point across. Basically successful people or outliers work very hard to get where they are, have help from family or friends, have hard work and success instilled in them from a young age by their family or culture, and catch lucky breaks along the way. That was the whole book summed up with out all of the filler non sense.",0
Ok. Okay,1
"Outliers: story of success books. Haven’t finished the book yet but it is quite interesting however, it’s statistics is quite confusing and not for the laymen",0
Four Stars. Interesting but a little slow. Still working on it.,1
Book you really need to read if you are interested in being successful. For non fiction this a great read. The facts he gives give a lot of food for thought especially with regards to whether or not a high IQ guarantees success or do other factors affect how well you do. If you are in education or motivation you will find it really interesting. We are using it as book group book and it is sure to spark a lot of discussion!,2
Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,0
"New Way to think about things. Worth the pick. I did enjoy learning to see things through a different light. At the end of the day, achievement and success might not be as far fetched as it is made out to be.",1
Five Stars. Great read,2
"A mesmerising read, from beginning to end.. This book is incredible. It's insights are fascinating and challenging. Gladwell puts his point across so clearly and methodically, with humour and great storytelling along the way.",2
Garbage. This sucks,0
"I never knew.... Never judge a book by its covers, especially when it doesn't have a cover (read it on my Kindle). I read this book with never knowing that hard work could breed success. The 10,000 hour rule that was mentioned was very profound and devastating. I am a professional in the medical field, and after reading this book I no longer feel that it's ethical for me to continue practicing. I hope to one day practice again, but I want to wait until I've got a little more practice under my belt (8200 hours to go).",2
"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",1
"Interesting..... This was an interesting book to listen to. I found it shocking how Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs were all born months apart. However, I did like Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink a lot better. I still would recommend this book to other readers because it does have interesting discoveries. Like the birthday example.",0
Five Stars. Excellent,2
"False attribution to the success of Outliers. Very good, although what lacks substantially here is how each outlier benefited more from luck than the ""10 000"" hour rule. By luck, I mean it more in the Japanese sense of the intersection of insight and opportunity. There are thousands of skilled athletes and programmers than can put in 20, 000 hours and will never become GOATs. So manage your expectations accordingly.",0
Enjoyable Book; Don't full-heartedly agree with underpinning generalization. PROs,1
Interesting and inspiring. Interesting to think about these examples. Find something you enjoy in life and dont stress too much about making it,2
"Perfect. Perfect……But I just started reading, why do you force me to write a comment? My friend recommend this book for me, and it seems it's an interesting book with very different views.",2
"90% there.. Great book. This book is a like eating a great steak and then the last bite has a bad crunch. Gratitude is where I believe he was going, instead the final chapter/interview seem to shift from gratitude into “you didn’t accomplish this, you did because someone else”. It seems to miss the hard work requirement of the individual and that individuals made every single choice. Maybe he covers that in other books. Still would recommend the book, gratitude is what I am taking away from the read.",1
"learned something new. Gladwell helps to identify the ""conditions"" that contribute to above or way above average success in a range of activities. As usual, the content and narration are first rate.",1
Four Stars. I think every child should read this book.,1
Looks like super people not so special after all.. Looks like super people not so special after all.,1
"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",1
"This book will stick with me.... I was fortunate to hear Malcolm Gladwell speak recently while at a conference. I had never read one of his books but after that conference I could not wait to do so. I decided to start with this book because my 16 year old son is required to read for his Junior Honors English class in high school (summer reading). I thought it would be a good book to discuss together. Was I right! He liked it just as much as I did. And, he is a hockey player born in August...this book really hit home for him and now has the reason why he will never be a professional hockey player in the NHL:)",2
"Four Stars. Great book, makes clear and concise connections between demographics, history, culture and intellect.",1
Magnificent.. This book is amazing. Although it is more likely a kind of research book but it’s not boring me. I have more knowledge about the secrets of numbers of successful and famous people. Some of them are my inspirations. I love it.,2
Awesome. Great book. Seriously. Everyone should have to read this.,2
Great Book. Great Book! I bought it for me and my girlfriend and we got a lot out of it. Great stories of journeys to success.,2
Outliers. Unique and interesting,1
Amazing book. He develops his points in a subtle but shrewd way. Uses great examples from different areas. generally great writing as well,1
"good quick read. I liked the message and the examples used, though I think the story could have been told, and the message communicated in fewer words. Still, a good read that is informative and easy to read.",0
"Food for thought book. I enjoy books that are thought-provoking. Really is more of an informative book with lots of interesting observations to ponder. Honestly, I am still reading it so I'm not sure what my true final thoughts will be",1
Five Stars. Amazing!,2
"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",0
"As a small business owner I had hoped to get .... As a small business owner I had hoped to get something out of this book that I could use myself. Since the bulk of the stories are about 19th century immigrants to NYC, I didn't get too much. I didn't take the stories as much more than an indication to look around and see what could be done to improve myself with the ideas and skills that I already have. Already doing that.",0
"Wasted money. I wouldn't recommend this book. I purchased it because a friend said it was a must read about success. I guess I just have a different view on what is a ""must read"".",0
Outliers. Have not finished to book. I just can't seem to get into the concepts. I will keep trying to get motivated to turn the pages. I guess it was not what I expected. Others seem to love it and recommended it to me.,0
Nice Book. Everything fine just didn't liked the cover it is removable.,1
Not as good as his other works. I enjoyed Blink and Tipping Point but I felt Outliers read like it was put together on short notice. The examples Gladwell used to prove his conclusions at times seemed forced; like the evidence could have been interpreted many different ways and he just manipulated it to work for his point. It was still somewhat interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for it again. Pick it up used.,0
Great Book. Very interesting topics. The style of writing is very intriguing and keeps you hooked and wanting to know more.,2
"Hard work and focus actually mean something. I recently heard the saying that it takes 10,000 hours of work and study to become an reasonable expert. I had become frustrated by people who think that a few hours of searching Google is somehow equivalent to a Ph.D. or MD. Or how Canadian hockey players are better when they're born during certain times of the year.",2
"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",1
"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success. The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom. The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? n ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",1
"Good Read.. Good book to read but does that means if we are in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is not much chance for the rest of us!",1
"I highly recommend this book. The book provides incredible insights into the top-tier successes in our society. The information is incredibly insightful and thought provoking. So much so, that after I started reading Outliers, I did not put it down until I had finished it. It gave me a deeper understanding on how some influences in my childhood played a role in who I have grown up to be. I highly recommend this book.",2
Gift for a friend. They enjoyed it thoroughly.,2
"Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell. The author combines the envious theory of socialism, mixed with self guilt, adds a dash of interesting stories and comes up with a transparent, flat manifesto of ""Free Societies are Fake"". He leads with a story of how the DOB of kids in elite Canadian hockey predicates their success. It hooks the reader. The story has merit and is interesting. There are a couple more catchy tales like the Montana rancher vs. Oppenhiemer and the Chinese rice farmer and rationale how the Chinese language is better for math. After these however it becomes clear that Mr. Gladwell wrote this book to push his beliefs that socialism is far superior a free society. Mr. Gladwell, IT HAS BEEN TRIED and failed all over the world. Eventually you simply out of other people's money to spent. The idea that there could have been hundreds or thousands of Bill Gates' if computers would have been supplied to everyone is purely a utopian pipe drem but it is an approach Socialists have asserted many times throughout history. One of the key elements the author chooses to exclude are the choices people make. Granted, if every person would have made the same choices as Bill Gates when afforded the use of computers then there would have been more Bill Gates' but we are talking about living breathing human beings and it simply doesn't translate. Choices are a much more important component in a free society than in a socialism/communism. The author's rhetoric really only accomplishes 2 things. Number one, it decreases his feelings of self guilt for being born into a ""privileged and entitled"" family. Quite simply, it makes him feel better about himself and number two it improves his public appearance by using his ""entitlement and privilege"" for the good of all those less fortunate. Again, an attempt to make himself feel better.  It is clear that you despise the thought that a person can be independent. I don't know where or why you have formed these concepts but I bet it is a product of how YOUR surroundings have influenced YOU. I gave your book 5 stars for the specific stories you tell but had to subtract three stars for the way you use them to justify the worn out idea of Socialism. I hope you will take all the money you make from you book sales and use it top make your self feel better because you are such a good person you deserve to feel good about yourself...in fact you are entitled to it.",0
Q gracias todo llego muy bien. Llego como se mira en la foto gracias excelente y muy barato,2
Another way of seeing.. My 16 year old grandson was asked to read this over the summer. I read it in order to talk with him about it. I thought the first 1/2 was the most applicable for a teenager and I enjoyed that part the best. I look forward to some discussion once he has also read it. I am an MSW and always am intrigued by this type of book that takes a new way of seeing human accomplishment.,1
"Outliers ""hits the mark"". Malcolm Gladwell has taken populr opinion on what it takes to be ""successful"" and turned it on its ear. I teach in public middle schools and high schools. A minority of my students think that hard work is more important than to be born with ""it"", whatever ""it"" is. Good math students are popularly seen as being naturally ""good"" at math while the less industrious ones lean on their parent's excuse of ""I was never very good at math."" The 10,000 hours of practice required to become ""good"" at ANYTHING is a number I can support. I have taught students from kindergarted through graduate school in college. The more dedicated to their education, the ""smarter"" these students become. The message delivered by Mr. Gladwell is music to my ears. I have quoted his stories in all of my classes to extremely receptive audiences. I heartily endorse this book for students of all ages.",2
"Outstanding...my 2nd best book of all time. Outstanding....I bought a kindle edition, bought another kindle edition for my wife but i need a hard copy for my library. My 7 year old needs to read this at some point.",2
Five Stars. Great book and onsite on the fortune evolution,2
"Four Stars. Though I did really enjoy reading this book, I was disappointed that it was such a short book.",1
Great Book!. Another Christmas gift for my husband. (Thought it would motivate him!) He loved the book. Prompt delivery from this company!,2
"Expected nothing less. What can I say, Malcolm is a genius and I love all his books.",2
"Yet another fan. This is a great book. Much more than the ""10,000 hour"" rule the book has become known for, it goes into detail on why and how we are a product of everything that has come before us. Some things are luck/chance, like being in the right place at the right time. But also how being aware of the things that have contributed to out personality, we can work with and grow beyond those things.",2
Excellent book. Excellent narration by Malcom Gladwell. I enjoyed the different stories used in the book and enjoyed as well the logic Malcom used as he describe each Outlier case.,1
Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Outliers: The Story of Success,1
"Wow. This book was fascinating and having started three businesses, I found that the theories/statistics/stories are helpful to a wide range of business people.",2
Buy it read it. Class read,2
"Important, interesting, and thought-provoking book. In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell explores how hidden advantages and opportunities play a role for people who've achieved extraordinary success. He looks at how cultural legacies shape the patterns of our behavior and that when and where you are born matters.",1
Five Stars. Very interesting,2
"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories. Christine Brown-Quinn,The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.",1
Love Gladwell's books. Outliers is a fascinating story of genius. No one gets there alone. He's one of the best thinkers out there. I just purchased David and Goliath for another great read. When you find an author like this you want to keep going and read everything they have to offer.,2
"Interesting Facts. The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful. In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",1
I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I greatly appreciate how he incorporates data and research into his logic. It gives my brain some substance to chew on. Outliers is great at pushing the reader to rethink how they evaluate success and consider what factors really effect finding it. Gladwell's writing style is very accessible and not overly academic which I also like.,1
Five Stars. Great Book!,2
Really interesting reading. It explains a lot of different thing about differences.,2
Unexpected. Good read,2
"okay read. It is an okay read, but the ‘great’ insights are based on a slightly more contextual reading of the various phenomena. Slightly repetitive.",0
"Could be half as long. I did enjoy this book, but I found it a bear to finish. Gladwell starts to make his point in the first chapter and then just beats you over the head with it until the end. He is very thorough, to the point where I felt my intelligence was being insulted. Half way into the book o audibly said ""okay, I get it."" Less historical story telling and more application of his idea would have been great.",0
Good service. Great book. Good condition and reasonable price.,2
"Thought-provoking. This book reminded me quite a bit of David and Goliath, which is the first Gladwell book I read. Sometimes the conclusions feel oversimplified or even far-fetched, but the book certainly is though-provoking. I enjoyed it especially because the stories made me reflect on my own life, legacy and community so I could more clearly see why I am who I am and where I am going.",1
"Can Outliers become the new Normal? YES! If we know how to design the right environment to learn, grow, and contribute.. Are outliers normal, only for the very small fortunate few, or can we create outliers as a normal? Mr. Malcolm Gladwell does a fantastic JOB discussing how our environment creates outliers.",2
Four Stars. is pretty good,1
"Three Stars. Its a great book and concept, I just lost interest.",0
Success can be perennial if handled well ..................... Excellent book with real examples of how one can convert opportunities into reality with perseverence ...............,1
Great reas. I found this to be one of the best reads I've read in years. It's a good book with a lot of substance. Gladwell writes in a very simple style that is entertaining as well as very thought provoking.,1
Four Stars. Interesting stories about real life situations.,1
Outliers. I found this book extremely interesting and educational. It gave me a totally new perspective on the influence of social forces on people's lives. I would strongly recommend this book.,1
"Outliers-Keith. Outliers is another insightful look by Malcolm Gladwell at what factors contribute to extraordinary performance by individuals in many walks of life. Not that you can take those insights and make yourself extraordinary, but you understand that there are opportunities that present themselves to you throughout your life that can make a difference, depending how you respond to them. A quick read that offers pause for reflection and a refreshing look at the dynamics of success.",1
Five Stars. SCHOOL BOOK,2
"Excuse me!. The whole premise is that if you're not born at the precise ""right"" moment you will not be sucessful. This is a great book for those losers in life who need an excuse for not being successful! He makes some interesting arguments but I don't buy into his premise.",0
"You get what you work for... but how much you get often boils down to luck.. Quite a brilliant examination of success, and in particular the effects of good luck on the rewards from hard work and talent. Gladwell's work neatly illustrates fallacies right and left. I can personally attest to many of the observations Gladwell makes, on both the upside and downside. And anyway, he starts with a hockey game. What's not to like?",2
Excellent. Excellent book,2
Four Stars. Great,1
"Interesting. I enjoyed much of this book, but I sometimes felt that Gladwell cherrypicked his examples to fit his thesis and contorted others for the same purpose.",1
Five Stars. This is one of the best books I've read in my life.,2
Very enjoyable educational read. Very enjoyable approach to an intelligent evaluation of the variables in any system.,2
"Good book with excellent other books references. This book has some good chapters, mainly the first one when he really talks about the secret to success — HARD WORK! But also gave a good reference to Hofstede work, which I was not familiar with! For that I am very thankful!",0
"Really nice book!. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in understanding society, the goods and the bads. It gives a different perspective of ideas you already have.",1
"I ordered two of them. Outstanding book for a high school student or above. Our MBA professor used some chapters from this book in our class; which was the first time I've read Gladwell; wished I would have had this class 20 years ago. By the book, and then by one for a friend.",2
Excellent book. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting as I couldn't put it down. Interesting and thought-provoking.,2
Educational. Shows very clearly how peoples' stories and statistics .... Educational. Shows very clearly how peoples' stories and statistics can be so misinterpreted. Also throws a different light on the factors that contribute to success. I shall say no more as it would spoil the surprises.,2
"Work of Genius. Rarely do I find such great storytelling skill in works of nonfiction. I went chapter after chapter excited with Gladwell's perspective on Outliers. Clearly, he must have spent a great deal of time researching for the book, and I daresay the effort has paid off. I recommend this book to everyone with questions on success, especially the young generation that is preparing for the world ahead.",2
"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer. You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories. But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""? The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point. Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past. You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"". Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech. And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous. Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success. Surely the successful need to ""share their success"". Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals). This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",0
"Outrageous!. Amazing book, just don't buy it here. Terrible experience, the package seemed perfect but what was inside can be seen in the pictures.",0
👍🏼. 👍🏼,2
A different theory.. An interesting presentation concerning achievement and what are the reasons some are successful. A different theory than the usual work hard and have inherited abilities.,1
Here's what I,0
Bad reasoning. Authors conclusions are too simple and not evidence based. The fact that some one has the right opportunities doesn't mean that's the sole reason for their success.,0
"This was a great book to think outside of the box. This was a great book to think outside of the box. It makes me view the world in a completely different manner than I use to. It has made me reevaluate how I am raising my 3 years old daughter. She is thriving more than ever, since I have changed my parenting, because of this book.",2
Amazing. A classic,2
Five Stars. Simply you need to read this book.,2
Very insightful!. This book helped to bring a new frame of reference. The way outliers become who they are and their path was very intriguing. Definitely a good read!,1
"Ok. I thought it was a good book, but there was a lot of information that basically tells you to work hard and you'll be successful....Duh",0
Outliers. Good book. Great insights. Great narrator. Thumbs up. I really would recommended it to anyone.,1
"Five Stars. An excellent read. Hugely varied examples throughout. ""View the world through a true academics eyes"".",2
"Good book, great writing.. The book is interesting and wonderfully written. Keep in mind though, that the author is just that: a writer. He is not a scientist and his claims are not based on fact. Interesting as they may be to think about, there is certainly no statistically relevant information to back up the majority of the claims. That being said, it's a good read and gets you thinking, which is a plus.",1
good product. came clean. no damage.,2
"Highly Recommend. Outliers was very informative and eye-opening. Gladwell certainly did his research. While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me? What steps do I need to take to replicate the ingredients for success? The answers to these questions go mainly unanswered. With that being said, I highly recommend the book! It is excellent information and with a little work I think we can come up with some great applications to propel ourselves toward greatness!",1
"Interesting look at environmental factors in success. Interesting book, especially when read in connection with Mlodinov's ""Drunkard's Walk."" I'm not sure about the author's conclusions regarding education, but found his thesis regarding environmental factors as an influence on success as quite convincing.",1
"Good book, well written, faulty premise. Malcolm Gladwell deserves his reputation as a gifted and insightful writer. He sees the world uniquely and has the communication skills to share those insights in meaningful and memorable ways.",0
"Breathtaking. At the start of the book the writer says he will take you on a journey. And at the end you will have a new way of thinking. This book definitely provides that. Well researched, well structured. One of the best I have ever read!",2
"Excellent book. Very interesting to see how many things. Excellent book. Very interesting to see how many things, such as birth dates, opportunities, luck, cultural differences, and hard work come together to help create success. Easy read, highly recommended. A+++++.",2
"A new perspective. I have enjoyed diving into the different upbringings and cultural differences, it was helpful to identifying certain approaches I personally have done prior and currently. Helpful & insightful!",2
"A Different View of Success. I first heard about this book when Chris Rock referred to it on The Howard Stern Show. When Stern asked Rock what it took to be a great standup comic Rock replied, ""ten thousand mother f***ing hours."" Stern got the reference right away, saying ""Malcolm Gladwell right?"" and Chris Rock said, ""it's my bible."" I downloaded this to my kindle before the interview was over.",1
"NOPE, NOPE and NOPE. Not my cup of tea. Malcolm Gladwell seems to, in many of his arguments, draw in heavy, dense, scholarly researches only to arrive at meaningless conclusions. Sure, his points are novel in the way that no one seem to have the time to notice (simply put, they are all common sense). I've realize that Malcolm merely assume facts and claim to logically ""infer"" the articles. Nothing spectacular. It saddens me seeing all these people buying into this.",0
"Interesting, short, straightforward. 1) It's not a long book.",1
Great book. Suberb writing,2
hindi language. Provide hindi and english both language,1
"Fantastic. This has to be one of the best books I have read. The author made me look at my life and that of others with a different viewpoint. I no longer beat myself about things I haven't achieved in life, I now recognise that the timing was wrong and that when it is right I must be ready and have the desire to achieve whatever it is.",2
Great book. This book is great!!!,2
Good book. Enjoyable read. More focus on luck than I expected. You can only be great at something if you both get lucky and try hard.,1
"Cool, cool (but...). This is another Gladwell's cool book. I've read the all and they all are very enjoyable and fun to read. The missing star is because I found as if Mr. Gladwell is repeating himself. The collection of clever ideas and unusual data has become Mr. Gladwell's trademark. But in his previous books everything was based upon some powerful insights. According to my taste the basic premise behind Outliers is not as powerful as the other two.",1
"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2
"You get what you work for... but how much you get often boils down to luck.. Quite a brilliant examination of success, and in particular the effects of good luck on the rewards from hard work and talent. Gladwell's work neatly illustrates fallacies right and left. I can personally attest to many of the observations Gladwell makes, on both the upside and downside. And anyway, he starts with a hockey game. What's not to like?",2
Good read!. Good book and daughter enjoyed the story.,1
"Nice reminder, too narrow.. Outliers: the one sided story of success.",1
Great insight but could have been 80% shorter. First two hours or so filled me with wonder a very different view on the world. Really gripping and interesting however the next five are rather disappointing. Kept listing because I had a fever and absolutely nothing else to do... Especially fifth word by word analysis of a rather uninteresting cockpit discussion (ten minutes each) was fatal. Only a rather slow four year old would not have gotten the point after the first two. However would buy for first few hours. Overall style of writing is good and narrator is enjoyable.,1
"Yet another brilliant work by Gladwell!. I have always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and this one did not disappoint. Gladwell did a thorough analysis on all of the factors that can contribute to one's success that are often overlooked or taken for granted. Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter. We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit. Although the concept presented by this book is not new, the detailed analysis conducted by Gladwell provided a thought-provoking insight. I highly recommend this book!",2
A must read book !. A must read !,2
"Good. Very good, important food for thought. Didnt give 5 stars because I felt a little bit of it was slightly convuluted jumping from one story to another and back again. But overall very good.",1
"Senior English Letter to the Author. Mr. Gladwell, y Senior English class has just recently read your book Outliers. The focus of our class and its curriculum is to pursue an essential question and apply it to our studies to give us greater perspective. The particular question my class must evaluate throughout the semester is ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Your book has been an excellent choice for the class, as it reflects upon the themes of time and place quite often. Throughout the book, you elaborate upon the idea that talent is not necessarily an innate quality in and of itself. Instead, you stress that often luck is a factor, mainly in the form of a person's timing or the culture they come from. Outliers are more often than not the result of elements that are out of their control, as you explain. ne chapter that stood out to me was ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" This chapter highlighted the necessity of hard work in achieving success, but it was interesting and surprising that you assigned a specific number to it. The examples of Bill Gates and the Beatles explained your point. For Bill Gates, in particular, the themes of time and place fit very well. He was born at such a time that computers were just becoming more of a present force when Gates reached maturity. Random events allowed him to have essentially uninterrupted access to high-end technology, which was further made possible by the lack of large-scale computer fluency during this time. Were Gates born at a different time or place, he would not have had access to all of these tools and advantages that allowed him to complete his 10,000 hours (even though the explanations provided did seem a bit revisionist). Practice does make perfect, I guess.  had a difficult time connecting with the chapter ""Marita's Bargain."" It seemed as though the stress Marita faced was being pushed as a positive. For disadvantaged students such as her, I do agree that the KIPP schools do a great job of making them rise above their socio-economic situations. However, do you feel that this sufficiently addresses the problem? To me, it seems more like a band-aid. I feel that a lot of the point of this chapter was strained in order to get across to us that underprivileged children are still smart. Which is not to say that isn't true - it is just overstated in this chapter. I also find it curious that in the case of children like Marita, time and place suddenly does not matter. How is she able to overcome her disadvantages and inherent ""bad luck"" so easily? You offer a rather politically correct explanation, something that people in our time (especially those higher on the socioeconomic ladder) love to hear in order to feel better about themselves. I am a huge supporter of education and equal opportunity for everyone, but even I thought this chapter felt a little forced.  also found myself disagreeing with the ideas presented in the chapter on IQ. Your essential argument is that intelligence is not really a factor in success beyond a certain point, and in fact that it is not really a deciding factor at all. The example of Christopher Langan's genius-level IQ but strangely ""unsuccessful"" life is interesting, but it is merely an anecdote that I do not believe can be the basis for the sweeping generalities you make. The chapter seemed guilty of forcibly adapting the theory once the necessary outlier had been found. (Cont. in next review)",0

Four Stars. like,1
MUST READ. Fantastic book. Talks about success in a way where you dont feel you have been failing all your life. So the stories and characters are great. It is not one of those I told you so books it actually teaches through its stories.,2
"NOT all it's cracked up to be. I'd give this a single star, but the creativity of the subject is enough to warrant at least two stars. Plus everyone seems to discount one-stars as vendetta reviews.",0
Five Stars. Excellent arrived within 24hrs,2
"Course Material. I enjoyed the first half and second halves separately, to me this book has an overall message and content but could be separated and the end result would be much better.",0
Great book written by a great author. The book provides a detailed review of success and the lives of many successful people in modern history. It is an eye opening book. You enjoy ready this extremely well-written book and you learn a lot too.,2
"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck. It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary. For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced. Based on your astrological sign! That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older. And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference. That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children. Is that fair? No. It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up. Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year. That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2
"Interesting perspective!. I preferred BLINK to this read, but OUTLIERS was still a good read in regards to a unique perspective as to why certain people are inherently successful. Give it a go!",1
Four Stars. Fascinating read.....,1
I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising account and very well researched. I like that he looked at things from a completely unique perspective. It certainly gave me some new ideas to think about. Putting a little more effort in studying and learning more about my profession is one of the things that I certainly took from this book. Sometimes all you need is a good book to remind us that we need to step up our game!,1
Stories that resonate. There were several examples in this book that were extremely interesting and offered a fresh perspective but ultimately it seems like the stars aligned and the perfect combination of factors influenced success in many of the big stories.,1
Planning for future of children. This is good info. Good for advising schools and next generation planning. Asp to encourage diligence in chosen career of younger people.,1
"Wonderful read. Great read, very insightful & educating. I really enjoyed learning about reasons for success beyond the outlier's control.",2
Read it twice. This book is so great. I conducted a weekly reading group with it. People who read it are still talking about the genious of Malcolm Gladwell. My grand children read it in high school. A family friend read it in college. It is an award-winning book!,2
"This may be the best of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.",1
some surprising keys to success. The author uses multiple examples of how cultures and supporting circumstances contribute to success. His examples are very convincing and provide food for thought as to how we may achieve greater success in education and achievement in this country and around the world if we apply these principles.,2
"Very Disappointing. This book was recommended to me a while back and the person that recommended the book was so passionate about it that I was sure I would love it too. But after listening to it, I see why they only raved over very minimal parts. The lessons of ""outliers"" and what they are is very valid and informative, almost inspirational even, but after over 7 hours of listening I maybe took away 4 truly VALUABLE lessons that accounted for less tha an hour of my listening time. This book is unnecessarily long and a lot of the information within doesnt really serve to enhance the lessons this book means to express. You could shave 60% of the content of this book and still get those same messages and honestly, a better reading/listening experience.",0
"Fascinating stuff. This book had been recommended by a friend, and since I had read Gladwell's THE TIPPING POINT and liked it, I decided to give this a try. It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come ""out of the blue"". Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.",2
"Putting success into context. Very thoughtful read, encouraged me to think a little differently about how I see things",2
"Fun and Informative. Although Gladwell has been taken to task for over simplifying things, Outliers is still intriguing because it gives you a glimpse of processes that happen invisibly in our daily lives. It will also make you count up how many hours you've been practicing certain things and maybe decide whether it's worth it to continue... Gladwell reads his own book well. Listen if you enjoy learning about all those little things you may have once wondered about successful people but never had the time to go find out yourself.",1
Some interesting insights. There were some interesting insights here unfortunately the author felt compelled to say the same thing over and over and over again which became very dull. The sporting examples got boring after a while and there was a lack of research in some areas - I got bored.,0
"Not my taste. Such a drag, some parts picked up, others just boring.",0
Great reas. I found this to be one of the best reads I've read in years. It's a good book with a lot of substance. Gladwell writes in a very simple style that is entertaining as well as very thought provoking.,1
Interesting. Interesting data and helpful hints on life,1
Very eye opening. Very good,1
Five Stars. What a great read! Really fascinating.,2
Best read ever. Extremely grateful to the author for this wonderful book,2
"A Neat and Informative Body of Information. What an amazing book. For me the word outlier has a very mathematical meaning, being part of statistical analysis which I taught. It was interesting to see another dimension presented in the form of actual real life variables coming together to have profound affects on the lives of some very significant people. There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747). I can relate to the struggle to rise up in social rank. My mother's family were Irish transplants from the potato famine of the mid 1800s on one side, and a runaway to sea from the island of Mauritius on the other. Overall the level of academic excellence in this book and the quality of intellectual thought makes it a worthy read.",2
Have to read!. Gladwell is good. A holistic view about success. Very interesting conclusions and nice stories from real life.,2
"Success has many parents. An interesting account on how some people become icons in their field. Gladwell covers everything from sports, to high-tech, to legal and entertainment professions. All with facts, opinions, and interesting biopics.",1
"Entertaining and fun, but not compelling. Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style. His writing is beautiful. The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",2
"Great points, but slow at times.. In typical Gladwell fashion, this book has the power to transform the way you think. His evidence is truly compelling and for the most part it's engaging. The one problem I had with this book was how many stories there were. He would start every chapter with a story--often a slow one, building up different characters and setting the stage, and then he would start another story, and another one. You would realize the points of the stories, but he wouldn't really spell it out for you until the chapter's end.",1
Inspirational book but I did not agree with the book's .... Inspirational book but I did not agree with the book's notion that success depends on the time frame an individual is born.,0
"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",0
"Thought provoking. Each example of the background of an outlier was fascinating. Gladwell has dug deep and shows that preparedness, hard work and opportunity lies behind most success.",2
Four Stars. Gladwell's inquisitive mind produces another best seller.,1
"Fun and thought provoking. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, this is another must read. It's interesting and makes sense. I wonder, why don't we do what he is suggesting about how we measure genius, intelligence and luck?",2
"Interesting...very interesting!. I read this because it was the summer reading assignment for my seniors this year. It started off really strong with some amazing information, but somewhere toward the middle it started getting a little dull. Upon our classroom discussion, most of the kids agreed with me on this point. However, I still would say it is worth reading because it raises some curious issues.",1
Worth reading. Interesting read. Still haven't finished it because the book drags in some places.,0
Five Stars. Great insight into success. Quite a revelation and once you know it kind of seems obvious. Would recommend.,2
Pretty good. Very interesting.. Good outcomes are a combination of lucky circumstances to set up people to be able to work hard. If people combine those lucky circumstances with their own effort and intelligence that's a recipe for success.,1
"a fair attempt to simplify something complex. This book attempts to explain how those considered outliers achieve fantastic success. The cultural background, date of birth and opportunities at work, wealth and parenting types. He does a great job explaining the importance of all of these things but frankly over simplifies and boils success down to almost only these things. He refers to "" individual ruggedness"" as dangerous and discounts individual performance and success to a community effort. He makes some very good points but he simply points out why the ""outliers"" the Bill Gates of the world succeeded because of there time, place, and opportunities combined with his hard work to become something fantastic. His theory does not explain how most of us non outliers can be successful given very similar circumstances.  In short this book is an oversimplification of a very small group of people.",0
"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",0
"Great Look Into What Makes Up Great Persons. After hearing ""Outliers"" mentioned by media outlets and social circles for years, I finally downloaded and read the book. This compilation of various Outliers in history and the circumstances that allowed them to become these outliers is presented in a unique and interesting perspective by Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys seeing an interesting perspective into what goes into making some one an outlier",2
"Interesting, well written and thought provoking.. It's one of those books where you keep telling people snippets of information (badly reproduced)",2
"Intriguing book. I was very intrigued by the first half of the book. Great ideas regarding the influence birthday cutoffs have on our future development path. However, the second half seemed to wander and I didn't feel there was a connection to the concepts presented in the first half.",1
"Simply explained and still the stories intrigue!. I first discovered Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, Revisionist History because I, too, at that time was thinking about doing a podcast to tell my stories. And while I was not the one to buy the book and my husband not listening to podcasts, I would speaking highly of Mr. Gladwell. My husband the. Took his Master Class online and then bought this book.",2
"Malcolm Gladwell is a brilliant observer of people. Malcolm Gladwell is a brilliant observer of people, their thoughts, and interpretations of events in their lives.",2
"Five Stars. Awesome book, blew my mind. You won’t regret taking the time to read this book.",2
great book with a lot of great information. while the story provides a great amount of information I feel that at times Gladwell dives a little more into the back story than needs he needs to.,1
"Gladwell does it again. I have read all of Malcom Galdwell's books. They are fascinating and engaging. His books are a series of different stories with a similar theme. I learned a LOT from his latest book ""The Outliers."" It contains secrets to success that actually make sense - the 10,000-hour rule was eye-opening. Wait until you read about WHY the best hockey players in Canada usually were born in the first three months of year.",1
Well written and almost impossible to put down.. Totally fascinating subject. Bought this after listening to the CD so I could pass it along to friends.,2
"Fascinating. The ideas proposed in this text seem revolutionary to how we generally view success. Though some facets may be a bit trite, like wealth and opportunity, the research and studies done to prove why these things among others are more likely to amount to success is incredibly intriguing. My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research. For an AP Psych summer reading book, I think it is a fantastic choice as it is interesting and thought-provoking as well as an easy and good read.",1
Disappointing Effort. I was incredibly excited to get my hands on Outliers after reading both Blink and Tipping point in years past. I often call Gladwell my favorite author.,0
interesting story about what came before. Really interesting story about what history has set up for us. However there were stories that ran too long and this detracted from the otherwise great idea of historical impact on current life.,1
Good. Quit good but not as much aspected,0
"Good except for Asian generalization. This book was very interesting and there is a lot of research to support the arguments made, except for the final section in the main book which tried to make some pretty broad claims about rice and entrepreneurial drive as the important reason for Asian skills with math. Recommend but keep your skepticism about some of the claims made.",1
"interesting concepts. Interesting concepts, good ideas but I felt it lacked a central theme.",1
"Compelling look at non-traditional factors for success. Gladwell succeeds by taking the tack of questioning widely held assumptions and beliefs around success and looking for other factors which contribute to success. Even though the explanations surrounding environment can cause us to pause, especially when the environmental factors can relate back to ethnic and socio-economic factors, they do create a thought-provoking vision.",1
"Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set .... Very interesting book, definitely worth reading. Fascinating set of evidence from different walks of life showing how we are conditioned by external circumstances. In the end still shows that talent and hard work still do matter - depending on circumstances you can get extraordinary results with what you get.",1
"overhyped and not very helpful. Not gonna lie, I had really high expectations for this book because it was highly recommended from all the reviews that I had read and from several friends that also told me it was very good. I was interested mainly because I thought it would be a self help/improvement book that had advice to apply to daily life, but instead I felt like each chapter was more of just providing factual stories and then having a conclusion at the end that I feel like were common sense or I already had learned through my own experiences from the past. The first few chapters were somewhat intriguing with the real life examples of successful people but then halfway through the book I already lost interest and was pretty disappointed in the content. I got pretty bored and finished the book just to finish it, not really because I wanted to.",0
They are lucky. Luck accounts for 90% of success.,1
"Culture can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",1
This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining. This book has several good stories in it that are very entertaining! Serious success really comes down to luck of the draw.,1
Good book. So true,2
"Success Is Not Luck. This is a great read! Often in a conversation I'll bring up part of this book. I'm looking at success differently now. What would appear to be luck or coincidence is given support as a series of events that lead the individuals within a group to the success detailed. Hockey players, computer ""geniuses"", musicians, business people are all given the deep dive into what allowed them to be at the top of their different fields. The book is broken into chapters that can be read individually similar to a book of short stories. I read this over a long period of time and didn't lose anything by not picking it up daily or weekly.",2
wow. awesome book...well written...excellently researched...wow.,2
Five Stars. Good book,2
Interesting. Interesting and easy read. Very informative and puts a lot of perspective on some success stories but it generalizes and zones in on specific success stories.,0
"Interesting as usual. Gladwell always delivers a well thought out thesis, impeccable research and interesting details. Just did not agree with the conclusions he presents in the epilogue. To me his book proves just the opposite of his conclusins.",0
My new excuse for not making it to the NHL!. I found this book to be super interesting. Some of the facts and data are outstanding and really hit home for me.,0
"Good reading but 4 stars for 10k hour rule only. Excellent book, BUT remember the success is when you achieve what you want. Your legacy, genes, sex, gender, size are factors you should consider, but only the sky is the limit and your mind is your first obstacle. I disagree we some considerations from author about circumstantial conditions in advantage outliers have. I know people with nothing in his favor that have achieved success. The most important thing or concept is the 10k hrs rule 4 stars for that.",1
"Thought Provoking Read. More than once I thought of Acts 17:26 while reading Outliers. The NLT translation says, ""From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries."" God sets the time and place for us to be born, it is up to us to partner with him for our high calling to be fulfilled. Therein lies the Outlier secret. Very thought provoking book, I will never forget the 10,000 hour rule of mastery, and strive to reach it in order to do what I was made for, while I can.",1
"Outliers-Stories of Success and Circumstance. Shockingly success may be less random than it seems. Being born right may have more to do with your future success than hard work and grit. Still, there is something to be said for being ready and able to meet opportunity, but it seems that opportunity may be best taken advantage of by the right people who are the right age at the right place at the right time.",2
It's a good read. Gives insight to most famous people in world and Chance they got.,1
Thank you. Thank you,2
Very interesting and informative. This book pointed out many interesting study results.,2
Four Stars. Thanx,1
Great read. Amazing book. Well worth a read.,2
"Nice, simple and informative reading. One of the best books that I've read in a long time. Haven't finished it yet but so far there are some valuable bits of information that really challenge the way I looked at success. Written in a style that makes it easy to follow once you get past the first chapter (imo). Glad I purchased it.",2
Five Stars. great product,2
"Bite sized stories of success. My first Gladwell made me regret I'd waited so long to discover to discover this prolific author. His analysis of successful people was entertaining, humorous, and thoughtful. He did his best to have as global a perspective possible and to help the reader follow his train of thought. Can't wait to read more of his work!",1
"worst. Liked most of the book. The epilogue was misplaced, a little bit too wordy and repetitive. The goals of this book may be too idealistic but are worth working toward",0
Wonderful. Page quality ist good. Pages are too yellow .,1
a so so book. Not exactly what I was looking for. Good message but explained nothing new. Thought the message was going to be more deep. Easy to read.,0
"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",1
"Great Book, exceeded expectations. This book struck my interest based on the recommendation of a peer. The book itself reads smoothly, is well researched with lots of facts and statistics and the anecdotes within are informative and entertaining. The unique stories of Bill Gates, The Beatles and Canadian hockey all stars are all fascinating. I highly recommend picking this book up, it's a quick and informative read.",2
Better than the Talent code- both are worth reading.. As I read this book I kept saying these people are not outliers and then in the end Gladwell validates my suspicions!,1
"A solid book, great stories and was enjoyable to read the whole time.. I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.",1
Amazing. A classic,2
Packed Full of Great Information. This is a really interesting book! Full of valuable information! I read this for my book club and would highly recommend for others to do the same. After reading this you want a forum through which to discuss all the data that was shared.,2
"Homework.... This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman. The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise. As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read. It’s always refreshing to review the information presented in this book. If you haven’t already, add this text to your library.",2
Started off great then fell off a bit. Book started off great then fell off a bit. The first 150 pages or so was about relatable topics then it got into stuff that I didn't really care about. Very interesting premise and I will read Gladwell's other books.,1
"Very interesting, makes me think about doing things differently for my children. This book makes you think about what it takes to be an ""outlier"". It isn't all brains and charisma. Very interesting book with many real world examples of success and a detailed breakdown of how it was achieved.",1
"Well written by shallow - par for the course for Gladwell. I love him as a writer of magazine articles, he is funny, concise, and even enlightening. He is a great interview. But, as a writer of full length books, he is horribly shallow and delves into a subject about as lightly as possible. At least this book was not mind numbingly dumb like 'Tipping Point'. There was some interesting stuff here (though that might simply have to do with my own ignorance on the subject).",0
"CDs were Ok. I gave this 2 stars only because the CDs were fine. The case was torn, bent and misshapen.",0
Excellent Read. This is such a good read. Malcolm Gladwell is an exceptional author of high intelligence who has grown accustom to writing for the masses. He can make the most complex topic easy to understand for anyone who is able to read at an 8th grade level. Great book with excellent arguments.,2
"One of the I've read!. If success, opportunity, and privilege are themes that interest you, this book is for you. With entire chapters devoted to education, I encourage any teacher (especially math teachers) to pick this up and read it. I could not put it down. Highly recommend, it will change the way you see the world (and the way you see success)!",2
Great. Once I started with this book I couldn’t put it down. Very well researched and thought out. Highly recommend.,2
"Super interesting read!. Such great thoughts, and a very good writer. This book kept me engaged and intrigued with every story and example that led to the final brilliant conclusion.",2
good quick read. interesting with a different perspective on why certain people can thrive and be successful yet others seem to miss the boat,0
"Great insight, fun to read. I like Gladwell’s way of putting data and insights together, but in a fun and easy way. Read Blink and this. Will move to the next.",1
Another great read from Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great book for anyone trying to understand all of the factors that go in to a person becoming successful. As a teacher I wish I could have all of my students read it and understand what it takes to achieve greatness.,2
Very interesting. Opened my perspective about the world in a way like no other ! Never knew so many things in life lie beneath the surface and are beyond the obvious.,1
Incredible. I loved this book. I manage to read the whole book in one week. I couldnt put it down. Very interesting about different opportunities,2
"Fascinating theories. This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make ""greats"" great. The stories are fascinating, and worth a read. Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end. That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off. I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.",1
"Good read, but does not challenge the foundations. Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.",0
"but definitely a good read.. Hasn't made me a success yet, but definitely a good read.",2
"Great Book. Well worth the read, it's got some good information and is presented in an easy way.",2
"Your success IS down to luck, at least partly. A brilliant book by an incredible storyteller with a profound and powerful message: it’s time to stop the glorification of genius and talent, and recognise success for what it is - a mix of opportunity, culture, luck, commitment and hard work.",2
Five Stars. An excellent read!,2
Excellent book. Would highly recommend.. Excellent book. Would highly recommend.,2
"Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey .... 2/3 done the book. Super interesting. I'm Canadian so I love the hockey references :) Has made me look at 'secrets of success' a little harder, and with a circumspection that I didn't have before.",1
"and could easily have been shorter. This book provides an interesting perspective on why some people achieve success while others of simiilar talent do not. It is repeaticous, however, and could easily have been shorter.",1
Great themes. Great themes yet I think this author could make the writing less extended,1
Five Stars. A great read,2
"A question of generalize what is learned. This book is very good and brings a new perspective towards our vision regarding successful people. However, it feels like it is forcing too much its vision because of a intrinsic limitation: it does not have the time or space to analyze every case of success in every area. So the book simply brings us a paradigm that we may believe it and search for ourselves, or not.",1
"Amazing. The best book I have ever read. Such an amazing mix of humour, adventure and life. Interesting from the first word",2
"Amazingly insightful. Just a remarkable book. Well researched and written, Gladwell makes you feel as though you are finding the answers to these questions and learning together. Highly recommend.",2
Five Stars. great book,2
Good Book. U will get more experience in Life. U can learn how to start new things in ur life. Best Book for learners.,1
"Five Stars. Fascinating, enlightening and in many ways reassuring. Well written and thought provoking. A very enjoyable read.",2
"and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I .... This book has fundamentally altered the course of my existence. I will remember this book and reference it whenever I can. I was forced to read it for class, and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I have read in my entire life this book has been the most inspiring. Many of the things in here are common sense. It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few. Greatness is in fact the reward of those who work hard. I read this book at exactly the right time in my life and would suggest it to anyone. I am an avid reader, but I have never enjoyed books presented to me in school until this book!",2
"Fascinating take on many modern topics. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's, but what a great intro. He takes a view of modern phenomenon and cuts to the heart of the issues which aren't the ones that you would expect. I particularly enjoyed the elements of cultural influence and how that influence persists over generations. I am practically applying the book by teaching my children numbers in Japanese as it could very well help them break down math more quickly.",2
"The good and the bad. Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.",0
Really enjoyable and easy to read book. Really enjoyable and easy to read book. A few big leaps and stretches but I didn't feel that it undermined Gladwell's ability to make you turn the microscope on your own life.,2
"You need to read this book!. Awesome book. A good mix of psychology, real life stories, history, and a feel good read. Finished it cover to cover in 4 days, I couldn’t put it down.",2
"kinda boring. high expectation for this book, but after reading half the book, i stopped. I felt like things were jumping around and many things are already obvious to me",0
Four Stars. Good Book,1
just incredible. I was riveted by this book and the amazing stats used to back up the author's claims. It has made me think very differently about my own life and that of my young child's.,2
Three Stars. Good.,0
"Good read. I like this book a lot because it makes one think about essential questions: how to succeed professionally, what should one think about individuals who seem to be very succesfull, what should one think about the circumstances where our children are brought up... there are a lot of facts and anecdotes in this book. I enjoy reading it!!!",1
"One of the best books I've read. One of the best books I've read. I absolutely love the conclusions he draws, though he takes a little bit of liberty with his interpretation of the data. I totally agree with what he says, though. Inspiring, uplifting, and incredibly interesting. You do not want to miss this one.",2
Good. Good,1
"I do not like to read, but when I do I read ........ Loved the down to earth tone when talking about some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...",2
"not as good as the tipping point. book was OK but it amounts to ""practice makes perfect"". not as interesting as the tipping point.",0
Very insightful from start to finish.. Never has a book ever become so alive . We can all achieve more if we put in a little bit of effort .,2
"First 200 pages: fantastic; Last 150: mostly fillers. This is simply one of the best books I have read..for the first 200 pages. Unfortunately, the last 150 pages mostly wasted my time.",1
"My favorite Malcolm Gladwell book so far. Everything Malcolm Gladwell writes is a gem, but this one is amazing. He makes connections among people and events and demographics and cultural changes in a way no other author comes close to. The reader will learn a lot from this one and want more at the end. I learned a lot about myself as well as about this society we live in.",2
It was very interesting. I liked how the author related back to himself at the very end. Very well written and I enjoyed reading it.,0
"Luck or circumstances. Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.",1
"borrow the book from a friend. Gladwell knows how to hook interest, unearth some unusual facts and spin a good story. Look somewhere else for original, prize-winning ideas. Nothing new here about the topic of success.",0
Really good book!. I bought this book for a class. I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone now.,2
Good. Good,1
"Very easy to read. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
Great read. Amazing book. Well worth a read.,2
"An important book. This is not just a good book. This is an important book. One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.",2
Buy this book. Love this book!,2
Great book. Read this book for a writing class in college and love how Gladwell thinks no matter your background you can achieve success.,1
Great book. Fantastic read. Interesting sociological information presented in an accessible way.,2
"Good ideas, but lots of fluff.. The ideas are interesting, though some have been disproven. I wish he would have cut the length in half.",0
Pop Social Science.. The first and last Malcolm Gladwell book I will read.,0
"Informative, but conclusions are strange. This book outlines some interesting statistics and relationships, but conclusions the author draws seem very strange to me (promotes despair?)",0
Gladwell at his best..... Great book showing hard work trumps talent....,2
"A book that in a nutshell comes down to being .... A book that in a nutshell comes down to being born at the right time and/or place. For the rest, if you want to succeed, then you have to put in 10k hours of effort to become an expert in a particular subject.",0
"The Outliers. The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called ""Skillful Teaching""....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster. I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field. Not difficult or technical in the least :-)",1
Good information to know. I don't necessarily agree with success being tied to some of the things he mentioned in this book. The information is good to have but it isn't lifechanging.,0
Worthless. First 10 pages crushed. Seems like an old discarded product. Disappointed.,0
"Insanely Good Read. Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.",1
Good Read!. Great book! I read it and passed it to a friend!,2
"This book will make you think!. So many interesting situations in this book, such as ""Why are Asian commercial airliners inherently more dangerous to fly?"" and ""Why are most National Hockey League players born in certain months?"" and ""Why did certain computer gurus achieve greatness while others did not""? Lots more situations to ponder as well",2
"quick read but how much did you really learn from it?. Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.",0
"Statistics can be made to prove anything. Although some of the ideas in this book are interesting to consider, my general feeling was that the author bent the information to fit his personal viewpoint. t did not come as a surprise to learn that being in the right place at the right time is a great advantage in life.",0
Must Read!. This book is part of a fantastic trilogy. Must read Blink and The Tipping Point....love Malcolm Gladwell.,2
love it!. must read! love it!,1
The book is original copy. The font size is bit small,1
"Worth Reading. I like Malcolm Gladwell, and this is probably his most applicable book -- it inspires and demonstrates his theories, rather than just explaining that they exist. I use it as a text in my AP Language class, and it is, by far, the kids' favorite read because it applies to their lives.",1
Required reading for college class. Required reading for college class,2
It's okay. Good product.,0
Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric .... Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric without being too learned for laymen to follow and grasp the concepts. I felt wiser having read this over a period of a few days.,2
"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",1
Amazing. Amazing quality. Amazing story.,2
"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",1
Five Stars. Good read.,2
"Very interesting.. Easy to read, informative. It explains a lot about how life 'happens' and develops by things that look like chance but are not really.",2
Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,2
Cover is very different. The cover is not as pictured in the advertisement. I am very disappointed. I had purchased this book before and it was stolen. Now the cover does not match the other 4 in the series.,0
"My dad recommended this guy. Almost sad at times, it completely dismantles the sentiment that success happens in a vacuum. Speaks at depth, without ever being boring or overly complex. Great read",2
"Great read that reviews a lot of Outliers and how they became such.. This was a fantastic read. It's very easy to take away from this book the understanding that Outliers (amazing people) is the result of the combination of a lot of forces with the primary forces being that of being good enough, being in the right environment, practice, dedication to growth, luck and timing. Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing. Malcom gets the point across in every chapter very quickly then continues to reinforce the topic by diving deep in to every person/situation/story explaining them in clear detail.",1
Just O.K.. It was heavily used. It still had the post it notes in it. It was really quick shipping!,0
Five Stars. A PRESENT!,2
good but repetitive. Well written. But the chapters (at least the first few) are very long and repeat,0
Neat point of view! It really spoke to me .... Neat point of view! It really spoke to me and how I need to look at all the little details of situations and create outliers in my classroom.,1
Five Stars. not as good as tipping point but an interesting read all the same,2
"Four Stars. Interesting perspective and I've referenced it often. Really common sense, though. It is the way life works.",1
Wonderfully Innovative. The research and conversational writing make this a wonderful must read. It will be particularly interesting for parents and educators.,1
Pretty good. Good book. Great writer,1
WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,2
"Thought provoking. The main thesis of the book is interesting and thought provoking. There are, I believe, many other factors to consider regarding what makes an Outlier the successful person they are. Environment, and opportunities for growth and development are crucial, that is true. I would also give ample credit to the Outlier's ability to be causative in their environment, and to find or even create opportunities for themselves. All of these factors and more will cumulatively create the outcome. A great book for a book club discussion!",1
It's a good book.. It's a good book. A different perspective for sure. Sometimes the author will do a little bit of stretching but I believe it was important so he coudl get his point across. Worth reading.,1
"Depressing, not inspiring. While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas. For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.",0
It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Words won’t do justice to this book! It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s so informative and easy to read while packing in so much interesting information.,2
"Excellent read!. So very interesting and insightful, I’ll be thinking of this book long after it’s read - a truly captivating book!",2
"I don't know about Malcolm Gladwell. I've read 3 of his books. All of them fine, but nothing special. All of them fairly superficial with nothing original or innovative. I think his books are very pop culture and should be read in the time frame (say within a year) that they are published. Too long after that and they become stale, not prolific or prescient. Gladwell is a very good and interesting writer, but I don't think his books have much depth or staying power.",0
"Truly superb. I finally read it and I find it to be everything everyone has said it is. Totally absorbing, ""Can't put it down"" reading, and staggeringly informative. TEN stars!",2
"Gladwell is a genius. Malcolm Gladwell is uniquely gifted in being able to first identify common assumptions and beliefs of social importance that are in fact questionable, then to make inspired connections that build a case for a contrarian perspective, and finally to present the evidence in a totally compelling, non-patronising and inspirational way. I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance. We should treasure visonaries and communicators like Malcolm Gladwell.",2
Eye opening. A must read for new parents. Makes you realize how important it is to take advantage of every opportunity and that hard work does have its rewards.,1
Highly recommended. Excellent,2
"Great book, very deep and relative to society now.. I gave this to my Marines as a gift, for earning a promotion. Certainly a great read. I recommend any newly promoted Marine to read it as well as any young man and woman.",2
"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",1
Five Stars. Item as described and fast delivery,2
"Robin's ""Outliers"" Review. ""Outliers"" is a thought provoking book discussing the events and environments that came together to give certain people the opportunity to be big successes, ie, the Bill Gates and Beatles of the world. It also discusses the reason why other people that should have been huge successes did not reach there potential.",1
"Great Stories, with a point. MG is a great story teller which makes you not want to put the book down - and the stories have a point - bonus! Great insights into success and failure. Wish he had explored the cultural ""background"" aspects more. This read also offers very practical parenting and coaching tips for bringing out the best in people, although they obviously aren't labelled as such.",2
"Forget statistics. Read it for what it is.. I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.",2
"Outliers: a must read!. When success is discussed and debated, this book will be its primer. Insightful and observant look at the cultural and human characteristics that affect our lives.",2
A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a .... A 'recommended read' for anyone in recruitment. Dispels a lot of myths and is also an interesting read on how some people have become extremely successful through luck and perseverance.,2
Five Stars. Right on time. 5/5,2
"Eye opening. This book goes deeper inside the nature vs. nurture, predestination vs free will argument more comprehensibly than any other book or scholar I have ever come into contact with. Malcolm Gladwell shows that success is a combination of luck and fate as well as development of skill and practice. If one is born into dire circumstances, will they succeed? Is fostering a talent more important that taking a abnormal interest in a subject the key to success? This book is a must have for a western civilization preoccupied with what the deserve over what they should work for.",2
Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was .... Excellent journalism. Another book I gave away and was happy to add to my personal library again. I recommend Caldwell's OUTLIERS to everyone.,2
Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,1
excellent book. Logical and engaging walkthrough of facts about successful people over the last few hundred years. Started devolving into feelings and hearsay in the last chapters.,1
"To sum it up, you can be lucky, or not. I enjoyed listening to the book, however, in the end, Gladwell concludes that an outlier for success is heavily determined by opportunities given to us from the moment we were born. This strikes little hope for those who want to be successful but weren't lucky enough to be born into an environment capable of guiding them to success.",1
"good book. Really enjoying it so far. You have to be able to ""think outside the box"" to get the full impact.",1
"Interesting theory. I don't think he adequately proved his hypohesis, but it is interesting reading. It DOES give one food for thought and conversation - if not necessarily convincing one of the accuracy of his conclusion.",0
Those who think they are outliers should read this. Ought to be required reading for every Prep Boarding School.,1
Worth the money. page quality is good but its cover pages looks a little damaged. Please take care of the products you deliver. We are paying to get fresh and new products. Thankyou.,1
"Absolute Genius. This is the first book I read for Malcom Gladwell, and I am impressed. The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",2
"Excellent book. Outliers is an intriguing book of ten distinct stories of how more than just intelligence and hardwork helped people to become outliers in their professions. The book explores the backgrounds of athletes, software developers, and lawyers plus many more. It is a great read and a great gift for others.",2
"Another article turned into a book. This is yet another article turned into a 300 page book. Only the first two chapters are worth a read. The author writing style is boring, repetitive, and predictable. This author is clearly over-rated.",0
Here is my animated review!,1
