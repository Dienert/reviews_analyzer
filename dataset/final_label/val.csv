"Recommended. Mr. Gladwell, Your book Outliers: The Story of Success was a very good read and it provided me with a new perspective on a topic that is widely referenced. Everyone has heard about the stories where someone goes from rags to riches, but you completely changed the way people think about success stories. Many people believe that it takes only pure ambition and talent to be successful, but you realized that there is way more to it than that. In ""The Trouble with Geniuses, Part II"", you showed that having a higher intelligence than someone else does not increase your chances of being successful. Being in school it is hard to understand how being naturally intelligent does not help because all of the awards and accolades are given to the smartest and strongest. However, the example of Langan and Oppenheimer showed me how some outliers in these award ceremonies came to be successful because they have charisma that others do not possess. Many people overlook these seemingly obvious occurrences, but your ability to convey this method has forever changed my opinion about success. In the class that we read this book in, we have an essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The goal of this essential question is to help us make connections to the things that we do in class and I can honestly say that Outliers provides the best answer to this question. Throughout every chapter you showed a new and different way to explain how success is a result of where someone is at, with two of the best examples found in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" The importance of birthdays as they pertain to sports had never once crossed my mind, but knowledge that I gained from reading your explanation in ""The Matthew Effect"" shows how much they affect success. The fact that some players will be naturally more mature based on cut off dates for specific sports seems unfair, but just proves the point that sometimes success comes from a little luck and opportunity. This chapter caught my attention because growing up I played a lot of sports and now I wonder to what extent did my birthday play in determining how successful I was. In ""The 10,000-Hour Rule"" you discussed two things that I love those being computer programming and the Beatles. This chapter contained the same theme of being born at the right time by discussing how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were in the perfect age range for when society began to become more technological, but it also showed how where someone is located affects success. Given that Bill Joy and Bill Gates were located near some of the few advanced computer terminals of the time and the Beatles were given long stints in a club in Germany, it is no surprise that they were able to succeed because along with their natural talent they were given opportunities to practice in places that allowed them to perfect their craft. Overall I feel like this book was one of the most interesting and thought provoking books that I have ever read. The amount of research that you had to put into this book is incredible given some of the hidden messages that you have found in a variety of things like why a group of people are lawyers at the same time. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that you put into this book because it really did change the way that I look at things. Sincerely, Ryan Crim",1
book. Our son loved this book so I bought it with every intension to read it but have not read it yet!! But my 34 yr old son who is extremly successfull loved it!,2
"Three Stars. Stories was good, rationale behind the stories was superficially explained",0
Five Stars. As advertised,2
"OUTLIERS OUTLINE. I'm a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. I think his research and writing skills are sublime; however, in Outliers, a book about about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary, he gets carried away.",0
Outliers. This book made valid points for the first 60% with statistics then faded out and became dull. I would recommend this book.,0
"Relatively entertaining.... A few insights here & there, but overall too simplistic. Clearly written to be a best seller, if you know what I mean.",2
"10,000 hrs too long. Interesting subject matter that could be written in 1/3 or less of the length of the book, with constant repetition as if the author believes the reader forgets what was previously read.",0
"Great book. Easy to read. Frankly, it is one of the best book that I read.. Great book. Easy to read. Frankly, it is one of the best book that I read. I saw video clip in which an interviewer asks Bill Gates about this book and his answer sound like a critic toward main ideas of the book. Now I understand that I wrongly understood the clip, Bill Gate didn't criticized the book he approved its ideas.",2
"A great book if you believe it's pointless trying to excel in life, as the odds are against you. I never leave reviews, but this book is a travesty. I am blown away and confused over the positive reviews this book has received.",0
Great!. Not finish reading it yet. But so far so good.,2
"Great information, but missing all-important prescriptive sections. Malcolm Gladwell manages to turn research books into stories that are engaging and exciting. It's a real gift. In ""Outliers,"" Gladwell supposes that there's no innate ""talent"" gene; that the Bill Gates' and Wayne Gretzkys and Robert Oppenheimers of the world are at least as much the beneficiaries of chance as they are of some talent that is so far beyond the rest of humanity. What's surprising is the deluge of research Gladwell trots out to support these assertions.",1
"but that it needed a better summerizing chapter to synthesize his ideas. I thought it was a very interesting book, but that it needed a better summerizing chapter to synthesize his ideas.",1
Educational.. Very informative.,2
"Outliers: The Freakonomics of Psychology. Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an ""outlier."" The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.",1
"Fantastic book. Lots of real-life examples, evidence-based approach, entertaining to read - what else can you ask for? I wish most of the books were written in the way this author writes.",2
"Outliers Letter to the Editor - Senior English. Mr. Gladwell, It was a pleasure reading Outliers, which is one of the more interesting books that I have ever read in school. My teacher chose Outliers as a class reading because it ties in really well with the essential question of our senior English course; the essential question is, ""to what extent does time and place define a person."" Before reading this book, I agreed that time and place can affect one's life; however, I never thought that it could have such a drastic effect on one's success. In Chapter 4, when you told the story of Christopher Langan, I was shocked to read that such a brilliant man like Langan can have such a disappointing future. In Outliers, you mentioned that practical intelligence is ""a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills are from our families"" (Gladwell 102). I found it really interesting that the most important factor in one's success is the environment one was raised in and not the level of analytical intelligence or IQ one possesses. It is something that is totally out of one's control, yet it still has such a dramatic effect. This quote really made me reflect on how I was raised as a child. I questioned my parents' parenting techniques and debated whether or not I have acquired this practical intelligence. As I kept on reading, the KIPP program that you talked about really caught my interest. Giving children who wouldn't otherwise get the chance to learn that much and get a better shot at college and a suitable job is awesome. Everyone deserves an opportunity like that. In a way, I had my ""KIPP"" program because I grew up in Philadelphia but my parents were able to send me to private school and not a filthy public school. The chapter that talked about plane pilots also caught my attention. I agree with you that your background may affect how you perform in serious situations. Americans know not to be passive especially when something is wrong, but someone from Spain or Colombia may be passive to the pilot because they are in command. This idea shows place can affect one's work and even life. Through the years though I think many are beginning to overcome this barrier. Overall, I believe you answered the essential question really well and all your ideas were very well explained and supported with great evidence. Therefore, I do not have any misunderstandings about the novel; however, I did at times think the novel got a bit repetitive. I got the concept quickly and wanted more but you gave me the same information just worded differently. The book really gives you a new perspective on how every little thing can control one's success. It is really interesting and once again it was a pleasure reading Outliers. From, Heather Monaghan",1
Three Stars. An interesting subject and thesis that could be explored further and more case studies should have been included.,0
It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) .... Fascinating facts and examples capture the reader's attention but some of the author's opnions are not totally applaudable. It seems like middle class family and the right brain (IQthat is) and right birthday... all these have to be right in order to be successful.,1
"Great Read. As with all of Malcom Gladwell's work, a must read. It makes you think about life and how you see it and live it. The take home point is grasp opportunities as they come, because they may not come around again.",2
"Nice, simple and informative reading. One of the best books that I've read in a long time. Haven't finished it yet but so far there are some valuable bits of information that really challenge the way I looked at success. Written in a style that makes it easy to follow once you get past the first chapter (imo). Glad I purchased it.",2
"Who Knew?!. This a great book! If you ever wanted a working theory on how to be successful, or how those you admired became successful, this is the book to read. Very thought provoking, convincing, creative and entertaining!",1
Five Stars. An excellent read!,2
"Thoughts on ""Outliers"". Good food for thought - dispels some myths about successful people. Easy to read and understand - enjoyed the book!",1
"This book is a very important look at how our great innovators rise to success.. I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book. Finally, someone has come to the truth of the luck of birth at a certain time, and luck of opportunity combined with concentration by the innovator, in seizing thr oppotunity or window of time.",2
"A book full of revelation. I read previous works from Malcolm Gladwell, such as blink and the tipping point and was looking forward to read this one; it is the same level of achievement.",2
"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I have always thought of myself as somewhat of an outlier and it was interesting to read this book for me. It is really interesting how our world and society as we know it shapes us. I like how the author used examples from a few different aspects that really made me think even more. Very though provoking! I followed this book with ""Where Good Ideas come from"" and suggest to to anyone purchasing this book.",2
Five Stars. Arrived quickly with no issues,2
"No excuses....get to work and get after your 10,000 hours. One of Malcolm Gladwell's better efforts. A great reminder (with proof points) that hard work, rather than genetics, is the primary determinant of one's success in life.",2
"interesting. very interesting concept, i liked this book a lot",1
"The real story behind success.. Excellent study of how so many success stories are due to special circumstances instead of the actual talent, among other aspects.",1
"Interesting. Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful. Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc. I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read. I'd recommend it.",1
Outliers: The story of success. I read this book twice before I bought it to pass along to others in my family. I think they were tired of my talking about it so much.,2
Well done.. Very interesting 🤔.,2
"Amateur.. Gladwell uses common knowledge to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He's the Disney knockoff of academia, the DC movies to the Marvel",0
"Great Book for a Critical Thinking Class. This is an excellent book to read for leisure reading or for a course on critical thinking. I used this book for a class in critical thinking and analyzing. The great thing about this book is the author discusses his theory as to what an ""Outlier"" is with examples and that unto itself, leads to discussions. Whether or not you agree with Gladwell, you will stop to think about what he has said once you have read the book.",2
Interesting studies. This book gave me a new perspective about how people create success. The reader was very fluent.,1
Great for first time parents.. I'm about to have a baby and this is a great read for expectant parents. I loved this book. Definitely would recommend it.,2
Food for thought. Interesting stories about what makes success (or failure)...and it isn't always what you think.,1
Another Awesome Read from Malcolm Gladwell. If you liked Blink and The Tipping Point don't miss Outliers. Gladwell again gives us a framework and ideas for thinking differently -- this time about society's most successful people and what it took to get to the top.,1
"Insightful.. This book offers not just an opinion, but actual data on what it might take to be successful, and how to go against the odds.",1
Good read. Mildly used and great read,2
"A voice to put you to sleep. Like always with Gladwell, very interesting material. But someone else should read the book. I could drink an entire pot of coffee and his narration would still send me off to dreamy dreamworld.",0
Five Stars. Fabulous service really great products thank you,2
"Fantastic book that will make you question all that you .... Fantastic book that will make you question all that you thought was true when it comes to success. If you want to learn something new and innovative, this is a book for you.",2
Four Stars. Very good read used it for a organizational behavior class in grad school.,1
"Extremely boring!. I love reading, and I honestly tried my best but I simply couldn't finish this book! Gladwell goes on and on and spends full chapters saying something that could have been done in a paragraph... So many pointless things... I felt such a waste of my time trying to finish the book. If I could I would ask my money back!",0
"Great Wisdom. One of the most thought provoking books of our time. Important read for parents, leaders and educators. Success is connected with hard work. Loved the true examples and thought provoking life stories. True life is better than fiction! Must read!",2
"Great book. Great book, with lots of interesting facts that make you think why people are so good at what they do. I won't give you more details because otherwise I will spoil the fun",2
"Success Story. This book was a real eye opener. It shows what other people may never think of. Malcolm Gladwell explains all the insights of how the people we least expect become successful or unsuccessful. Just become someone is intelligent and has high IQ, does not mean they will always become the most productive. Timing, opportunities, culture, and practical intelligence also play into how successful a person may be turn out to be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not directed towards group. Anyone can read it and everyone should read this novel. I found it to be brilliant and useful in various ways. Overall, Gladwell wrote an excellent message through this novel.",1
"Great book. In this book, the Outliers, I mostly enjoyed how the author, Malcolm Gladwell, found interesting facts or details that contributes to an individual becoming successful or an outlier. For example, Gladwell looks at,”Demographic Luck” (a.k.a the effect of one’s birth date). Gladwell shows that your birth date can affect whether or not you make a sports team or become smarter than someone else. I enjoyed this aspect because instead of just explaining his theory Gladwell supports it by using many real world examples.",1
"Understand what he is trying to say,. Understand what he is trying to say, just feel it is a little narrow minded to point to place and time of birth when relating to people being successful",0
Brilliant!. This was fascinating and thought provoking. I have been recommending it all round. A good one for those who wonder how much control we have over our destiny.,2
good read. give a few pages and it gets interesting,2
"Review of ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell. I bought this book for my 20 year old grandson for Christmas and read it first so that we could talk about it. We both found it really fascinating on several levels. Stories bring facts to life, and Gladwell is a master story-teller. His approach of telling a different story of success in each chapter is very reader-friendly in that you can read a chapter, put down the book, and come back later without having to remember what you have already read. However, I found it so interesting that I didn't put it down for long!",2
"I can’t believe I just read something this dumb. Do you want a one sentence summary of the conclusions of this book? Well, it doesn’t matter because I’m giving you one either way.",0
Interesting read. this book provides an interesting perspective regarding the subject of how people that our society deems successful obtains their success.,1
Interesting Read. It was an interesting read but not my favorite my author. Learned some interesting things so worth reading!,1
Came used and cover looks like it was printed from a printer n taped on. Absolutely terrible. Don’t waste your time. Condition was -10,0
"Great Read. Such a great book, interesting perspective on success and high level achievements.",2
"Who knew? Data applied to our lives. Great tales of the human condition, and how rare and unusual facts contribute to our world and the people who live on this mortal coil.",1
"Grear narration for a good book. Book starts on a pretty interesting note, bit gets monotonic by the end of it. In last 3-4 chapters, author just make some examples fit into category to prove the point, without getting a complete picture, and sometime deviating from what the book is about",1
One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people. One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people,2
One Star. I ordered new but it seems used. Corners are ripped.,0
Book ordered. The book came in perfect condition. As it was a present for a friend I was delighted and would recommend this seller.,2
"Success has many parents. An interesting account on how some people become icons in their field. Gladwell covers everything from sports, to high-tech, to legal and entertainment professions. All with facts, opinions, and interesting biopics.",1
Three Stars. Very insightful with regards to transparent social patterns that make people more susceptible in becoming outliers.,0
An Excellent book!. This book completely blew my mind and changed my thinking about what constitutes success. It's given me a fresh perspective on my own life and some gold nuggets of truth for the future. I highly recommend this book to anyone out there who's searching for some answers about what it means to be successful and how to go about achieving it.,2
Pretty good. An exquisite recap that shows the relevance of context for the development of human beings.,1
"My 16 year old loves it!. My daughter needed this book for her AP English language class in school. However, she has read it several times, and told me how much she enjoys the book. Win/win!",2
The secret of success. This book is telling the secret about success,1
"An honest look at success.. I have hope that even this late in the game of life I can forge a path to great success. This book has helped me understand that my background plays a key role in why I feel I have struggled with success as an entrepreneur. I feel inspired to collect data based on my own life, study the patterns, and give myself the chances that were absent from my familial and cultural legacies. Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell, for this meaningful gift.",2
Five Stars. One of the most informative books you will ever read.,2
"Should be on every bookshelf!. Have bought this book several times; give it as gifts, so keep having to replace it on the bookshelf! A great read and a real eye-opener!",2
Interesting Points But Overly Broad Assertions & Racist Postulations. I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.,0
Bloviation. A couple of interesting observations. Enough ideas for a good essay. Swollen into an entire book.,0
"Great Book for Stimulating Conversation. An excellent book to help people realize the vast importance opportunity plays in the lives of successful people. The first half of the book is more pleasurable to read, but the second half of the book deals with politically sensitive subjects that not many social justice warriors would be willing to accept or frankly listen to.",1
Good Read. In the beginning I was absolutely in love with the book but I kind of started to loose interest towards the end. I still think it's worth the read but I'm not raving about it as much as I was during the first few chapters. He uses some really interesting examples that really make you think. I also enjoyed the very casual tone/style of his writing he really speaks directly to the reader and gets his ideas accorss clearly. It was a quick read.,1
Age defiant!. It was recommended to me by a young person. I am over 60. Took a flyer. Cannot recommend this book to much. Have read all of Malcolm books. insight and wisdom.,2
Four Stars. Bought four of these for gifts and very happy with purchase. Would buy it again,1
"Malcolm Gladwell has a way of writing that almost feels like a m. Malcolm Gladwell has a way of writing that almost feels like a magic trick. e pulls you in with intricate stories and then spins out the complicated web of how they came to be, leaving you in awe at both is ability to spread the information and at the actual findings. I had to read Outliers for my English class and at first I thought it was oing to be extremely tedious, but I ended up liking the book more than I thought I would. n this book, Gladwell digs into the strange stories of unique opportunities, cultural legacies, and the importance of a birthdate that ead to success. It is a fascinating ride that had me gobbling up chapter after chapter and left me wondering about the successes of y own generation and what is yet to come.",1
"Senior English. (Cont.) Although I found most of your answers to quite reasonable, I found that your explanation regarding the ""Matthew Effect,"" was quite general. I don't believe that being older necessarily makes you better at something. After all, in the context of hockey players, the older kids are only older by a couple of months. However, I did agree with the fact that our society focuses too much on initial success and we naturally write off those who don't experience initial success as failures. As a result, we do tend to make the successful more successful while those who initially fail, continue to fail due to lack of resources and opportunities. This fact applies to students in school. At our school we have enrichment programs that selectively help the kids who initially showed talent in elementary school. However, as we grow older, I see that there are people not in enrichment that are smarter than some kids who are in it. verall, I found Outliers to be a thought provoking book that addressed situations and questions that we as a society often wonder about. The book is outstanding regarding the fact that it teaches us to analyze with logic and rational. As I have mentioned before, it is the perfect book to address our essential question. incerely, erry Lee",1
"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2
Excelent book. I recommed this book to be more realistic about success. We have to look at success in a different way,2
It is a book!. A very good and interesting read.,1
very thought provoking. Very interesting case studies and theories. They got me thinking of situations in my own life where things may have added up.,1
Great read. Makes you think about success. Well written and researched,2
Wow thats why people are succesful.. Was guided to this book by one of my sons rugby coaches. Well worth the read. Even if you haven't got a son/daughter who is talented and are getting frustrated by their lack of application this book is worth reading. Ever wondered why people are succesful well here is the answer.,2
Very interesting read. Well thought and some provocative ideas put forward! A detailed historical account of success that makes one pause and reassess success!,2
Good read.. Gladwell is a good author and always provides a thought provoking experience. What more can be said about this book ????,0
Highly recommended reading. Malcolm takes us into the world of .... Highly recommended reading. Malcolm takes us into the world of stats and you'd be surprised about some of the numbers.,2
Worthless. Bad pages quality. Looks like first copy. Disappointed.,0
"Good read. I love Gladwells writing style, i also love how much i learned from this book!",2
"Insightful. Interesting insights on education and the success of industry leaders. I would love to see an update on the 10,000 hour theory. Stanford recently did a study that disproved this idea. Still worth the listen!",1
Expected a better product. Book is good but the publisher Pustakbhandsar sent it of worse quality,0
"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable. Plus it gets the reader thinking about what causes success and makes an argument that is not often expressed outright - basically no man is an island and no one is a truly self-made man. Lots of great examples throughout the book to support the argument.",0
"Highly remmended read. This is a read for every person who may wonder why some people lead ""charmed""lives and most of us don't. It explains in well written and easy to read detail that is the hard work, opportunities seized, and belief in the unknown future that makes greatness, if not in ourselves, then in our children. A must read for all those who don't understand the wisdom of hard work being it's own reward, not handing things to people and expecting the same appreciation.",2
"Worth the read. I liked this book, it has good insight and is thought provoking.",2
Good. Good,2
"Read this when your children are very young. A book of ""things it is good to know"" when raising children and understanding success. Another outstanding Gladwell analysis that makes so much sense. Two important thing I will keep handy is: the importance of perseverance (how do you get to Carnagie Hall) and teach children to do math like the Chinese!",2
"Fantastic. From beginning to end, so educational. They say this man writes this book is an art in itself. I've learned so much.",2
"My first Gladwell. Parts resonated for me, while others seemed farfetched. There's a difference between causation and correlation which the author fails to acknowledge.",1
Fabulous - a real mind bender. I enjoyed this book enormously. Full of very interesting stats and studies that help you understand why some people can achieve so much. Some underling assumptions are successfully challenged. A book to bend the mind and make you reevaluate.,2
Loved it!. Read this for a sociology section. Loved it!,2
Thought provoking. analysis fascinating,1
"Broad Applications. This is a well-researched book. Gladwell does a great job of plugging the issue of chance into the formula of success. However, I would have liked to see more examples that do not fit each of his arguments, as surely they exist. It would have created a more compelling and fortified point to show why these possible ""outliers"" did not attain the status that Gladwell's Outliers achieved.",1
"Loved it - absolutely loved it!!. Beautiful, exciting and explains why things are the way things are. What I got from this book is that time and chance is just as important as having parents who propell your academic and social education - nothing is impossible!!",2
As stated. It was in good condition.,2
"Good Listening. I have not had as much opportunity to get through the full audio book, but have enjoyed what I have and look forward to finishing.",1
Amazingly Informative. I was drawn to Malcolm Gladwell because of his Masterclass on writing. I enjoyed the class and thought I would certainly enjoy his writings. I was not disappointed. This book about success taught me so much about opportunity and culture and how those two things impact the success of many.,2
Love Gladwell. Insightful and well-written.,2
"An honest look at success.. I have hope that even this late in the game of life I can forge a path to great success. This book has helped me understand that my background plays a key role in why I feel I have struggled with success as an entrepreneur.

Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell, for this meaningful gift.",2
Great non-fiction read.... I bought this book as a present for a friend. I read it some time ago and just loved it.....,2
"a startling collection of real life examples of time and place which look like chance, but are well-crafted and purposeful momen. Astonishing patterns that Maclom Gladwell has assembled here! Rich in detail, and a compelling and the unfolding storyline capture your interest from the start - hockey players ages, Bill Gates 'dropout' luck, Beatles overnight success....a startling collection of real life examples of time and place which look like chance, but are well-crafted and purposeful moments in time and opportunity that are much more than a '30 second soundbite'. Excellent read, and kept me hungering for me as the book unfolded. One in a hundred of books that I will remember for a lifetime. A great and satisfying read",2
Overcoming the odds. The format written,2
"Great book!. Outliers gives an excellent and true explanation about the success factors, taking opportunities, practicing, learning about your past and looking to succeed with this.",2
geeat book. Nice book. Made me really think. The hockey chapter as well as the plane crashes one really opened my mind to be more of a critical thinker.,2
"Very Informative and Insightful. I though the overall book was well written and insightful. It opened up my mind in terms of how people succeed through hard work, determination mixed in with lucky circumstances",1
"Another facinating read. Malcolm Gladwell's books are always a fascinating read. I find myself quoting him in conversation. He gives reasoning behind beliefs I have long held and point out ""obvious"" conclusions I can't believe I never thought of. Being a fact based person, I find his conclusions well founded. I highly recommend all of his books!",2
"There were certainly parts of this book that I found quite interes .... There were certainly parts of this book that I found quite interesting and that made a lot of logical sense. Although the points are occasionally repetitive and over-drawn, Gladwell makes the point of using examples that force us to rethink the definition of ""success"". It doesn't have to mean innate ability to be smarter or more innovative than others, and can depend on a person's circumstances in life. ooking back, however, I realized there were only 3-4 chapters that I found myself truly immersed in his theories. I wasn't very fond of the fact that he spent 46 pages talking about plane crashes when the point was easily established in a third of that amount of pages. On the other hand, I related to and felt that he did a solid job analyzing the success rates of students that wait an extra year to start elementary school versus students that start earlier and are the youngest in their grade. Additionally, I liked his take on the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" because it essentially provided a perspective behind the reward of hard work. astly, for the first half of the book, Mr. Malcolm Gladwell comes off as quite pretentious, almost as if his theories are superior to all others considering the subject matter. Even though the book is well written and makes good points, it wasn't particularly groundbreaking. It had some really good parts, and some parts I didn't enjoy as much.",0
Four Stars. Truly enjoyed it.,1
common sense. I was expecting to learn something insightful and new but it was all pretty much common sense. It does include interesting anecdotes and case studies.,0
Should be required reading of every human being!. Should be required reading of every human being!,2
Not quite in immaculate shape on delivery.. Some of the pages had a small rip when I receive this in the mail. It was as if something sharp had jabbed into the pages from the side. This did not impact the readability of the pages.,1
"Incredible Insights.... Outliers is an amazing book that discusses different examples of success. Non-intuitive insights are presented as a way of explaining success in terms of factors that transcend the ""rags to riches"" story lines that we are too often force-fed.",2
Good read. Good read,2
A great read. Highly recommended,2
"Well written.. I find that Mr. Gladwell writes another enticing book. I actually spent an entire day reading all the way through his third book, and to no surprise, it was one of the best reads of 2008. I actually suggested the book to one of my teachers, and she now plans to a project with next year's students in conjunction with the book. She even went about purchasing all three of Mr. Gladwell's books. It is easy to say that Mr. Gladwell will be, if he is not already, one of the best writers of our generation.",2
"Excellent Read - a Social Scientist version of Freakonomics. Easy to read, insightful, and very very interesting!",2
The Outliers - Success is deeper than you think. The outliers is mind-blowing and revealing. It shows a fascinating way to analyze human behavior. How can someone's birthday predict success? Why did life take you into a certain direction? These and other questions are answered with compelling facts and data. Situations that appear to be mere coincidences are actual blueprints to success.,2
"Fascinating. Well researched look at success, culture and opportunity.",2
Four Stars. Excellent book. I would recommend it for anyone interested in non-fiction.,1
An entertaining yet insightful read.. A terrific read especially for parents. Gladwell substantiates his theories with both quantitative and anecdotal evidence and uses entertaining examples that anyone can understand to show they play out in the real-world. Now I see what the Gladwell-hype is all about. Will definitely be checking out his other works.,2
"Good read.. Still reading it but,it's interesting so far.",1
Four Stars. Ver interesting read,1
"Outliers. I think it is an exceptional book, as it reveals aspects about human behavior not commonly known by the average man in the street. The value of ""Outliers"" in my view is that the Thesis of the author is not a fair-fetched one, but something that anyone could apply in daily life, for practical purposes.",2
"Just OK. The thesis is redundantly applied to every occurrence as a universal law of the universe. I rather think Gladwell fit selected historical events to the theorem....thus a tight fit. In general I thought it interesting but a ""so so"" audio book. It would not be a waste of your time to listen to the Outliers.",0
"Review for Outliers: The Story of Success. I originally bought this book because it was a requirement for one of my English classes, but by the end of the book I really did see the importance of what this book has to say. It is spot on with its statements and it is a fascinating read!",2
"Your success IS down to luck, at least partly. A brilliant book by an incredible storyteller with a profound and powerful message: it’s time to stop the glorification of genius and talent, and recognise success for what it is - a mix of opportunity, culture, luck, commitment and hard work.",2
"""Outliers"" is itself an outlier: a great book. Outliers: The Story of Success",2
"This is a must read!. This book is fascinating. I have heard several speakers refer to this book, specifically that people such as sports professionals, musical prodigies etc. have spent 10,000 doing their craft before they reach that level of excellence. Beyond that this has amazing sociological studies and information about why people become great at something. I don't even like to read very much and I am really enjoying this book. I am finding things useful for my own life as well as useful to train up my children. I gave a copy to my father-in-law and want my 14 year old son to read it.",2
"success. The author's views are very interesting. Age as a factor in sports or school has always been known to teachers. My area allows school entrance with birthdays up to about through October. So children born in November, December and January have an age advantage in sports and studies.",1
"Excellent author plus. Excellent author plus, the shipper got it here on time, just when expected! Loved this journalist's talent ...superb and masterfully prepared, engaging stories all to highlight some common thread. Each chapter is a keynote feature of some intriguing theme. My favorite was the over-arching idea that some things are just outside of the norm and probing all the possible takes of WHY that is. Hence the title. Now, the most visual of story-tellers takes you into many time periods and cultures and slices of professions in order for you to see his perspective and buy into his philosophy. It is part history, science, statistics and A TON of human interest all blended with an honest voice the reader trusts. Finished this one in hours.",2
"Good read!. This book was different than what I expected; however, I still enjoyed reading it. I finished the book in about a week. It lets you know that all successes are achieved through a series of fortunate events and your core support team, such as your family.",1
"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas.",0
Great read. Enjoying the book thus far.,2
Five Stars. a vital read for anyone who doubts their own ability to succeed.....just got to keep on keepin' on,2
Simply Amazing. I am probably the millionth person to praise the author and his work in Outliers. How ideas and concepts are woven together and how fat the author reaches in time and space to weave them together makes this a masterpiece.,2
Three Stars. Can't quite get into it? And it's an audio!,0
Came used and cover looks like it was printed from a printer n taped on. Absolutely terrible. Don’t waste your time. Condition was -10,0
"Excellent Book on Developing Skills. This book is filled with examples and data that are convincing to support the hours one needs to experience and invest to develop a particular skill to the professional level. The book cites successful and creative individuals. It opens the eyes on what is required to be an ""expert"" and serve a community or society. Excellent book.",2
a gift for a dear friend. a book everyone should read,2
Three Stars. Pretty interesting. a little wordy,0
Four Stars. confusing at the end about jamaica,1
Four Stars. It is quite an interesting read.,1
"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2
Fascinating perspective on normal every day life!. Malcolm Gladwell is amazing! How he finds all of this information is beyond me. But it is really really interesting! This is probably the fifth or sixth copy of this book that I’ve bought I keep lending them out!,2
"Didn't exactly read this book - Joe and I listened to it in the car on the way home from visiting family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, and was very fascinated by certain parts of it, especially the sections about the Beatles, computer programmers and Korean co-pilots.",1
"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",1
"Too Many Assumptions, But a Beautiful Ending. There's some interesting information about what it takes to achieve proficiency in a particular endeavor and what it takes to achieve excellence in your field (not necessarily what you'd think), but the generalizations here are uncomforable at best.",0
"Thought provoking. Very interesting read on how people benefit from circumstances in their environment. As a parent, it has made me think about what advantages I may be able to help create for my own children.",1
"Great Read, Faded Pages. Several pages were faded beyond the point of being legible. It's worst on page 245 for me, shame the return date just passed.",0
"Easy to read. The author reviews the aspects of successful profiles (known and unknown) not only from the education point of view but for all societal, historical and different points of view.",1
Good service. Product was as described. I am happy with my purchase,2
Perfect for you if you want to see the world .... Perfect for you if you want to see the world a different way and dig a little deeper in interesting subjects.,2
The book is original copy. The font size is bit small,1
"An intriguing read. I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's podcasts and articles in the New Yorker, but it took me a while to get around to this book. It was nice to hear the story told in Malcolm's own words, and I found the points he mentioned interesting and sometimes surprising. The overall message is that success is as much a product of a persons upbringing, culture and circumstances, as it is to how hard that person worked or how 'smart' they are. I liked that Malcolm concluded with the fact that anyone is capable of being successful as long as they are given the opportunity to practise their talents, but I can see how this opinion might be a little depressing to those who feel like they've missed out or were not offered these opportunities.",1
"the first half was riveting.. I enjoyed the first half of the book. The facts and figures made sense and were pertinent and relevant. the second half was more describing cultures and why some generate more successful people than others. not certain that I agree with all of the conclusions, but the book overall is entertaining and was worth the purchase.",1
"Excellent. Should be read by policy makers. Intriguing readable and fascinating book which shows how luck, fortune and class interplay for creating success . I'm passing this on to so many people",2
Read For a Class. The book is very interesting. It is full of interesting facts. Wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't for my class.,1
"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",0
"What makes a success. This book was a very simple read. Straight forward, interesting but nothing that kept me glued to the pages.I like Gladwell 's writing so I'm not knocking the book. Content wise it was a unique concept. Once the thesis is laid out, this who are wildly successful are a product of multiple unique opportunities, it predictable. I'd recommend this book to any one who likes Gladwell 's writing topic and appreciates unique topic.",0
"Theory. OUTLIERS is an interesting book but I don't feel it is especially enlightening or in most cases practical. We have no choice who our parents are, where or when we are born, and much of the material in the book is based on these circumstances.<br /><br />Warren Buffett in his book, THE SNOWBALL, speaks of the Ovarian Lottery and it is hard to challenge this. It may be that with the information we are given in OUTLINERS, assuming it is factual, that we might want to make some decisions about when our children enter school. Certainly being in the right place at the right time has always been advantageous in life.<br /><br />Children born to good loving parents with positive parenting skills will always have a definite advantage in life no matter where in the world they are born. It doesn't hurt to have a little luck but in most cases luck is the result of preparation. As Gladwell states: ""Luck is winning the lottery"". Though many parents would like to blame others for their children's misgivings all should feel a responsiblity for our children's successes and failures. <br /><br />Everyone will have many opportunities in life. The key is to be aware of them and take advantage of them as no one knows when the last one will arrive.",0
"Good food for thought. I've had this book on my list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally had a chance to read it. It's great for conversation topics with some of his case studies (as a big Beatles fan, I love the story of their time in Hamburg and the 10,000 hour rule).",1
"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",1
"leap of faith coming short. The book is a good read, maintaining the twist on the topic at hand as per other of Gladwell's titles. The only criticism is the stretch to accept the correlation between agricultural styles and educative approaches seen in contrast between Asian and Western culture. I do not think it's a well-supported argument.",1
"Duh. The blurb for the book says, ""In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"".""",0
"AKA ""Class Warfare: Prejudice and no Pride"". This book was mentioned by several thought leaders I respect. Well, now, I respect them a little less. Basically what this nonsense spews is that when you make it it's just stupid luck. Also, poor people are stupid and weak.",0
Made me think. Very well written and an interesting premise. My problem is its so anecdotal that it's hard to tell if Gladwell's theory can be extended out to all of society. But the stories were fascinating and I will read some of his other work based on this.,1
"Great book. Great book - gave it to two relatives as a gift. I especially like the chapter on how the sewing skills Jewish immigrants brought with them in the 19th century led to being their economic springboard, rising economically above other immigrant groups of the time, and making New York City the global center of textile manufacturing in 1890.",2
"Love Gladwell's Point-of-View!. Malcolm Gladwell's observations and social epiphanies are thought-provoking and applicable. His style of writing is exciting, and the fluidity makes all of books and articles such fast reads! I have been a fan of Gladwell since I read Blink in high school, and he hasn't lost his charisma with this one. Reading Outliers is inspirational for those who questioned success and ever doubted their ""luck"" in finding success. Otherwise, the book puts so many events and facts into new perspectives.",2
Just okay. Book is very helpful for entrepreneurs. But the paper quality and printing is too bad. I'm not satisfied with book quality. Please improve it.,0
"Which was perfect, because I was 2 days late to ordering .... The 1 book I had to read in college that wasn't a drag.",2
"30 pages in my book were just missing. Well it would be great to know what happens after page 16, my book didn't print anything after that until page 49.",0
Fascinating. Great book,2
"Amazing Book. Just like all of Mr. Gladwell's books, this was another hit. Well written and very inspiring and educational this makes you compare yourself against siblings, friends and co-workers. Just like all of this other books, they provide a thorough look into something that you may have overlooked.",2
"Must read for those who want to know what makes some people successful and others not so much.. I found it to be a very enlightening read as it was reinforced that success is earned, not given. Circumstances do play a part but not entirely. I recommend this book to everyone.",2
Tap if you hate this book. why (answer me in a review),0
"This is a very well written and interesting read.. Gladwell has a very accessible writing style and these theories are presented in a very interesting and thought-provoking way. I absolutely loved the book - for non-fiction, it has a great hook and I couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend it.",2
Fascinating!. This is my second time buying this book.,2
Quirky. Revealing. Insightful.. OUTLIERS is the third book which slices the world view in a slightly different way.,1
"Unscientific. I actually liked this book quite a bit. While I liked it, overall it was rather Unscientific in its approach. There are almost no citations, so you are to take the author at his word. There are definitely some very interesting parts. The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating. The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief. Gladwell describes things as they are without sugar coating it to keep people from being offended. His theories, however unscientific at times, seem plausible nonetheless. Worth your time to read this.",1
"Here's hoping I was born in a good year. Malcolm Gladwell has given us another page turner. After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",1
Interesting Read. Interesting read but why do I have to write this Amazon? I am just looking to read for a few minutes to elevate my insomnia and this is not helping.,1
Four Stars. Great perspectives. Need to process what I read and compare with related reading but definitely worth the purchase.,1
Four Stars. Interesting book,1
Outliers is outstanding. What made Bill Gates a computer whiz at a time when very few people knew about computers? How did Wayne Gretzky become such an outstanding hockey player? What are the circumstance that make an individual just good and another great? The answers may surprise you.,2
"great. New concepts, great stories",2
Interesting thoughts. Which sound convincing. In India we often see lives transformed based on this critical opportunity. Have seen many brilliant careers subdued cause of a lack of exposure a sense of entitlement that many don't have.,1
One Star. SOOOOO BORINGGGGG,0
"Educational and Eye Opening. Malcolm explains intricacies amd complexities in such simple language that this book will suit any audience. The book lays bare, in so many ways, how the world tends to work. It is an inspirational book that i enjoyed thoroughly.",2
Good buy from AMAZON !. Good buy from AMAZON !,1
A decent read. pretty interesting study of why some things or people are outliers and his you have to look beyond the obvious.,1
"Loved it - absolutely loved it!!. Beautiful, exciting and explains why things are the way things are. What I got from this book is that time and chance is just as important as having parents who propell your academic and social education - nothing is impossible!!",2
Interesting fast read. The author strings together some very interesting facts and figures that seem to support his theory of what makes people successful.,0
Four Stars. Great narrative style with interesting examples to drive point home,1
"Very informative. ""Outliers"" is very informative. In a few chapters I could relate to the experiences of people who I know personally as well as to those of my own. The chapter of 10,000 hours is especially significant because of projects I have undergone myself in which it has taken as much time to be acknowledged by others in proficiency.",1
"Observations On Icons Of Success In History. Book is very entertaining as well as interesting. Has some great history and examples of monumental successes and goes into detail on the circumstances surrounding those successes. Author has some very unique observational view points that are ammusing to say the least. Agree with the authors points or not his books are very thought provoking I think everyone would agree, even those who don't like the book for whatever reason.",2
Five Stars. My son loves it.,2
"Interesting read since it exposed the reader to a realistic way to look at how and why people succeed. A well-written and easy to understand approach to understanding individual success.. I enjoyed M. Gladwell's approach to presenting a comprehensive presentation of the path to success across different careers and cultures. ""Outliers"" allows the reader to think differently about how people within specific cultures become more successful than others. A positive approach to achievement that enables the reader to feel more empowered about oneself.",1
"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",1
"It Explains A Lot..... Great companion to ""Tipping Point"". My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.",1
"LESS IS MORE. This book, as other books by this author is long. Not long as in many pages, but long as in goes on & on & on & on on topics that do not need to be dragged out. ""COME ON MAN, I GET THE POINT""",0
"We can all be Outliers. From the Beatles to Robert Oppenheimer, and later understanding the cultivation of rice patties, this makes Outliers such an interesting read. The fundamental question in this book is, are geniuses really geniuses? Gladwell argues that it really where you are placed in society and maybe even luck in birth. This book was a fascinating read. Unfortunately sometimes Gladwell does not know how to end a chapter. Once a point is made, it is made. Overall, I did enjoy the book.",1
This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. The insights which are constructed on top of careful research are ground breaking and shook my previous understanding of how success comes about to its very foundation. Part one of the book entitled Opportunity is very well written and I sailed through the 5 chapters in record time.,2
Conditions. Great conditions,2
The cover of the book was torn. The cover was badly damaged. Sorry to get that from Amazon....,0
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Read with an open mind this book is definitely a life changer. One of the most inspirational and motivational book to date.",2
"Five Stars. Great book, from a great author.",2
Some Interesting Facts. A very well written and well researched book looking into why certain groups of the population are more successful than others.,1
Five Stars. If you like detail,2
"Good book, but overlooks obvious things.. Basic thesis of the book: people are only successful due in large part to opportunities afforded them (which come in various forms, culture, computer access, birthday, type of job their parents had etc). While yes these opportunities are huge—Bill Gates wouldn’t have become the person he is without the Mom’s club buying that computer for his school. (Example from the book) He wasn’t the only kid at that school who had access to that opportunity. On a more broad scale, yes a January Birthday is an advantage to aspiring Canadian hockey players but not all those who are born in January go pro. There are deeper levels in the individual outliers that enable them to achieve. Even taking his theory at face value, wouldn’t the real outliers be the pro players born in December?? Study them. The January kid should succeed. (Again this is another example from the book). I think the book makes a good point that a lot of times successful people had incredible advantages, what it doesn’t delve into is the difference between them and the other people who had the exact same advantages!",1
"💋💋💋💋💋. Oh my goodness i gave this book 5/5 kisses! It was an awesome book. It talks about how successful people are rarely successful on their own. Their was an advantage somewhere that they usually don’t mention. Even though persistence and hardwork is a major factor, if more people had some of the same opportunities then maybe their would be more successful people. I love how he talks about his advantages and his families advantages at the end of the book. I couldnt put the book down.",2
Great book. This book was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone.,1
"Interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed listening to this but I can't help but discredit the conclusions made by the author a little bit due to the inaccuracy of one fact he presented in the book. According to him, Singaporeans are outliers when it comes to math championship because they come from an agricultural society, in particular rice planting nation. The cultural belief that one must wake up before the crack of down to be rich (grow, harvest, etc.) certainly didn't come from this.",1
"Interesting Ideas for an average reader. While Gladwell brings up interesting theories about our inheritances, he does not actually prove anything and thus the book is more entertaining than scientific.",0
"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",2
Interesting and enjoyable. I really enjoyed this book . I think it helped more than most leadership books I have read.,2
"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards. Given all the rave reviews and how influential this book has purportedly been, I wasn’t expecting to feel so meh about it.",0
"Pop-sociology for the masses. This is the first Gladwell book that I've read. It was pretty good, but surprisingly sparse. He has a knack for tying together seemingly unrelated points and his prose is understated which makes for a pretty easy read.",1
Don’t buy it unless ur teacher/ professor makes u. I highkey hate this book but I might be a lil biased by I had to do a book report on it.,0
"This is a very well written and interesting read.. Gladwell has a very accessible writing style and these theories are presented in a very interesting and thought-provoking way. I absolutely loved the book - for non-fiction, it has a great hook and I couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend it.",2
Good book with great stories. And a fun read. The points Malcolm Gladwell makes are definitely accurate. And there’s an interesting set of anecdotes.,1
Four Stars. good reading.,1
"Interesting, Informative, Invaluable. Some things manage to remain hidden in plain sight for the longest time and then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, someone or something somehow manages to lift the veil of mystery from their existence. Others may not be hidden but their cause and effect mechanisms are not fully understood until a unique perspective finally comes along and combines common sense with the multiple streams of psychology, history, culture and mathematics flowing in the background. With 'Outliers' Mr. Gladwell somehow manages to accomplish both these 'little miracles' in a seemingly effortless manner. The ability to perform these rare feats simultaneously immediately makes it one of the rarest and most important books I have ever read.",2
Five Stars. Item as described and fast delivery,2
"Excellent Read, Freshman-College level required reading. Have you ever wondered why some people make it and some people don't? Malcolm Gladwell exams this question through interviews with many persons",2
"Fascinating. I enjoyed reading this book and it's study of the ""self made man""/genius myth very much. A fascinating insight drawn from the author's personal experience and background.",1
Insight into the reasons of success and failures. All star hockey players' birth dates show a rare recurring phenomenon;,1
Good read. Good read!,1
"Great for Book Club Discussion. Malcolm Gladwell uses lots of memorable stories in his well-written book debunking what we think about ""success."" Whether you believe he's made his case or not, you can't argue with the facts he presents, only his interpretation of them. It will make for a great book club discussion!",1
"Outliers. Not just a book, thought provoking and challenging especially if you have kids! What opportunities are you creating for them and what plays to their advantage naturally due to the factors discussed in the book? There are doubters out there who disagree with some of the concepts which is understandable, that's what the book is meant to do - make you question!",2
"Excellent book. The many interesting facts presented in the book are thought provoking. Moreover, now when considering what led to the success of an individual, some of the factors that at first would appear to be disadvantages should instead be viewed as those that directly led to their success.",2
"Absolutely fantastic book. One of the best books i've ever read in the thousands i've read to date, superb read and totally recommend it",2
"Expecting more.. It ok, I was expecting more information about how to be success. For example, How to use the examples of the successful people in my life.",0
Four Stars. Great book!,1
Insightful. Puts personal history in a different light. Reading this book made me appreciate all the outliers in my own life that brought me where I am today as a successful physician.,2
"Cherry-picking. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
All good. All good,2
"Not Entirely Accurate, But Good Principles. Reading Outliers as someone with a couple decades of professional experience, and many years more of a committed drive toward excellence, I was encouraged. 10,000 hours sounds great. I have that easily and am enjoying success in my career. This book appeals to my ego, really.",0
"Gladwell Rocks. First book of Gladwell, and I enjoyed it so much I bought 3 more to give to friends. It was entertaining reading, while I learned so much. Chapter 7 on commercial airplane pilots was fascinating...thinking outside the box. I'm going to read all his others.",2
Very interesting and thought provoking. Very interesting and thought provoking. Lover this book. I will recommend to anyone who is looking for a book to read,2
Four Stars. It's a great book to read,1
Four Stars. read it!,1
Good book. So true,2
"Outstanding Book. One of the best books I've ever read from a practical standpoint. Very motivating and helped me really see the ""big picture"" of hard work, keeping my eyes peeled for opportunities, and allows me to view success just a bit differently than I had in the past.",2
"Fun anecdotal book which gives pause for thought.. I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell, though find it important to take his writing for what it is: as an inspiration to think along his lines. His books tend to be somewhat drawn out, with long anecdotes to support his claims. Although somewhat tedious at times, they serve to help the reader remember his key points.",1
Surprisingly good..... .. Interesting connections one wouldn't imagine are explained.,1
great read. Really interesting read that can be applied to other great people in the world. As a father in waiting definitely left me with some interesting thoughts ob how to educate my kid,2
"Makes One Seek Opportunity. It was a great listen, it really made me reevaluate how I look at my employees. It helped me check my bias concerning individualism. It helped me look at outside factors and how those affect success. It was definitely an eye opening book.",1
"Best recommendation I've had. A colleague recommended this book as an interesting description of what is ""success"". Thoroughly interesting factual examples that contain concepts and notions that can be applied in professional as well as personal situations.",2
Not a fan. Didn’t like this book at all. Just a bunch of stories about people……. Thought it would inspire me but I couldn’t even finish this book,0
"Takes More Than the Individual. Loved this book. Could hardly put it down. Easy to read although a little repetitive in some places. Not a reason to avoid reading it as I hope it provokes the reader to re-evaluate more closely what came together allowing the achievement of stunning success. Great success (or potential downfall) arises from an intermingling of many factors, not just the individual's efforts or smarts. Many have the smarts but the misfortune of not being born at the right time in the right place. Made me realize we mistakenly worship the ""cult""of the individual's efforts without looking deeper into the timimg & circumstances that prove to be as much if not more a factor in success.",2
Stunning. To say that it cleared away with myths is the least I can say.Gladwell's outliers did much more for me.His mention of the 10000 rule and examples strengthened my resolve to excel in my chosen field,2
Hidden agenda in arguments????. I’m not sure what the hidden agenda is but Gladwell tried to force feed you ideas with shabby and one sided success stories. You could easily take from this book that if you weren’t born into the right socioeconomic class for you’re particular field of interest and you might as well just give up and go home. True Bill Gates had a great advantage that he had an open computer terminal at the age of 13 Gladwell presents the story as if he and his colleagues were the only ones on the face of the planet with such an opportunity. It’s just not true he tells half a story in order to make a point that can’t be really supported any other way. That’s only one example of the mini holes in his ideas. I enjoyed the book thinking fast and slow but there he basically reported on findings without necessarily injecting his own ideas and his own agenda into the writing. I got a lot out of that book but I think I will revisit it because this book is having me questioning the integrity of his writing in general.,0
Not bad. pushed two ideas: hard helps get you there but it matters more where and when you come from.,1
Book. Good book,2
"very interesting and engaging book. Very, very interesting, definately a good read for two reasons: it is thought-provoking when it comes to our idea of how success is achieved and it is very well written! In the ending, when the author chooses to use his own family history to illustrate the point he makes throughout the book, there are some shocking passages on racism, it really makes us realize how far we've come and how much is still to be accomplished. The chapter on aviation and the way culture influences how we act is pretty engaging. I had a really good time reading the book!",1
"We like to listen to these on road trips.. Anytime we have to drive for a while, I purchase a set of CD's that we can learn from. We have enjoyed this set alot.",1
"Five Stars. Love, love, love this book. Blew my mind and brought about so much awareness. Highly recommended!",2
"mind bogling! new approach to success!. I wasn't expecting much of another success story; however Malcolm gives such a straight forward and pseudo-scientific approach of how people achieve success, that I'm still ""in shock""!",2
not cohesive. the story is somewhat scattered ... I would stop reading for a day and come back to it thinking i was reading another book.,0
Bad quality. Very disappointed the paper quality of the product is worst.,0
"Does as advertised: explains outliers. You may have heard that this book explains outliers in society well, and this delivers.",1
"Human connectivity, interrelationships are key to meaningful lives. One of my past pupils recommended that I read this study in June 2018. I picked it up from Amazon and began to read it on a journey to San Antonio, and completed it on the return trip to Berkeley.",2
"assumption based onesided research methods. this is like the normal incredibly biased base news reporting...this type of ""soft science research approach"" is what gives all soft sciences a bad name!! wouldn't recommend to anyone...its just agenda based preaching...",0
Four Stars. great,1
Humanistic. It was very interesting and the author did a lot of research. It's just plagued with humanistic presuppositions.,0
Five Stars. Thought-provoking and interesting.,2
"Passed the time during a flight. Somewhat entertaining.......the stories presented to support the hypothesis that success is based less on hard work and more on where and when you're born (pure luck) is an interesting one. But, many books with many stories could written to support the opposite.",0
"5 stars. Such a great book, ai can't stop reading it! Arrived fast and was in excellent shape.",2
Well written. Extremely insightful and very worthwhile read.. Well written. Extremely insightful and very worthwhile read.,2
"Good read with lots of compelling points. Good read with lots of compelling points. Only trouble is, that it sometimes took too long to get to the point.",1
Better than Blink. Excellent book - great insight and very well written. Gladwell is an excellent author and this is one of my favourite pieces.,2
"Success is less about personal ability than it is about opportunity and hard work.. I chose this rating because this book gave me a lot of food for thought.The information was fascinating and the writing style brisk, amusing and easy to read. Success doesn't occur in a vacuum, it is more like a puzzle of many parts. I recommend this book for anyone who has ever wondered how the famous, and the successfully where they are and why.",2
"Well written and provocative but a bit myopic. Interesting stories and statistics about how ""life is not fair"".",1
Nice Book. Everything fine just didn't liked the cover it is removable.,1
"A great book if you believe it's pointless trying to excel in life, as the odds are against you. I never leave reviews, but this book is a travesty. I am blown away and confused over the positive reviews this book has received.",0
smart. i loved the very insightful stories. it was obvious that this was researched thoroughly. one of the best,1
Good Perspective. This book is part of a body of information on how to be more successful. It got repetitive to me.,0
"Good quality product. An must read book from everyone , good packaging by Flipkart but too late delivery it took​ 6 days so recommend Flipkart to deliver to early",1
great. great,1
One of my recent favorites.. I’ve gifted this book to at least 10 people. I just can’t say enough nice things about the book or Malcolm Gladwell. It’s a joy to have your perceptions realigned this late in life - but not easy. Gladwell does an amazing job of making you reanalyze the way you think.,2
Essential reading. Everyone need to read this book.,2
A Very Iteresting read. This was probably my most interesting reads for the whole,2
"Complex interesting. A hard book to follow at times. With the inter weaving of how opportunities determination, luck culture contribute to life",1
"Fatalistic. Interesting points, but he takes great pains to disqualify years of work in favor of circumstances and luck. He'd have you think the 70 percent of millionaires who came from humble beginnings are a mere product of their environment. It's folly but entertaining if taken with a grain of salt.",0
Good listen. Liked it...food for thought...Liked the authors voice and although it gets a little lengthy the message was worth it.,0
"A Newer Perspective. Malcolm Gladwell gives his readers a brand new and better perspective on phenomena which we thought we already understood (but didn't). I really didn't know that geniuses also have to work hard to perfect their areas of genius. Gladwell shows us that anyone who wishes to do great things must put in his or her 10,000 hours of sweat. Bravo!!!",2
"Outliers. As usual, Gladwell does an outstanding job of exposing the critical issues we face and how they are best dealt with.",2
"Insightful, Yet Expected. I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.",1
"Four Stars. Well written, insightful and thought provoking",1
Interesting. Worth the read.. This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and it was a good intro. I found the portion about the speech with the pilots to be the most interesting and thought provoking. Will definitely look for more of his work after this.,1
Four Stars. interesting book. claims weren't always convincing,1
"Simply Amazing!. Is truly a great book and one that you really need to read if you're starting your career and want to be successful. It helps you embrace your ethnicity, cultural background and other personal ""baggage"" and realize the good and the bad of the hand you got dealt. The best part is that gaining that awareness will help you create a plan to compensate or potentialize these subtleties of your own history.",2
"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2
"English Teachers Don't Read Their Recommendations. Summer reading, once again demonstrating that those selecting summer reading spend less time selecting the material they inflict than actually thinking about their students needs. Of all the wonderful and thrilling reads available this pedantic piece of semi-scientific fluffery isn't worth the time or effort. Better off reading a textbook on statistics than dwelling on those living at the edge of the bell curve. Flip a coin, what's the chance it will land on its edge? That's the chance a High School student will have of enjoying this book.",0
"Pretty good read.. Overall this is a pretty good book. The text is well written and a very informational, however, at times seems to lose focus of the overall topic. Yet despite this minor flaw, this book is a must read. Author Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job.",1
Two Stars. BORING!,0
"felt like half the story, but a great half!. great narrative and perspective. it just felt like it was building up and never really got there. what about those how are NOT lucky? Do they have a chance at success? are there things they can do to create/identify the all-important ""opportunities"" necessary for success?",1
"A bit fluffy, but enjoyable. ***1/2",0
Good read for awhile. Got tired of it Three quarters through. Got the idea of the principles.,1
"Fascinating.. Gladwell's books are absolutely fascinating. The topics he explores often seem completely mundane, however, the angle he takes on all of these subjects are completely unusual. The end result is a greater understanding of the subject matter and more importantly, a greater understanding of the processes being described in the books.",2
"Unconvincing and overly long.. I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",0
"The Outliers. The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called ""Skillful Teaching""....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster. I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field. Not difficult or technical in the least :-)",1
"Almost A Book. I gave this book three stars. Two means you do not like it. That is a tad strong. On the other hand three stars (It's OK.) is also not quite right. The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book. So, he starts with birth dates of hockey player but then goes to socioeconomic class (hardly news) and then a extended narrative about himself.",0
"Highly recommended. Good book. Easy to read. Thought provoking. Makes one think about privilege and opportunity. Interesting cases and anecdotes. I'll never look at self-proclaimed ""self-made"" people the same way.",2
"Four and a half stars. A good book that reveals how success is more related to history and circumstance than it might at first seem,especially in cases of success that are often put down to genius.",1
I really love it!. Is an information book. I bought it to read. It is very very good. I really love it!,2
"When were you born?. Well written, thought provoking book. A very good read.",1
"Entertaining book. I bought this book for a class I was taking in school. We were supposed supposed to study the way that Malcolm Gladwell writes since he is very successful in his style.I think he is an entertaining writer and this was a good read but I don't buy everything he's selling in it. I've read his other books as well and feel the same way about them. I'd probably like them a bit more if there were just a tiny bit ""more academic"".",1
"An interesting hypothesis sans convincing proof. As a Gladwell fan I took away a lot of interesting perspectives about success. The context of a person's life versus the content of his genetics...seems to be his central theme. His examples demonstrated the myriad failures of arbitrary distinctions. But his central hypothesis was not satisfactorily proved, at least from my perspective.",0
"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",2
amazing. Great story teller. Easy and fascinating read. Definitely recommend it. Being successful has a whole different meaning to me now.,2
They are lucky. Luck accounts for 90% of success.,1
"A new perspective. A new perspective of how famously successful people reach their success, from the reality of individuality to looking at the surrounding circumstances.",1
Incredible Read. I wish I had picked up this book earlier. This redefines how the world will see success for generations to come.,2
good read - interesting information. Good book. Lot of information that I found interesting.,1
"Buy it now, you won't regret it.. One of my favourite ever books. Gladwell is an awesome writer who provides such an educated, interesting insight on things that you just hadn't considered. This book has honestly changed the way i now think about things. Everyone should read this book.",2
"In improved understanding of the path to becoming an ""outlier"", but not really a ""how to"" book. Initial data is revealing and informative. Later examples and stories are longer and less compelling. A mixed message on how ""success"" is realized, and what truly leads to ""outliers"". An interesting read in the first few chapters, then a little less so as the story continues. The final chapter, an intimate story of his Mother's path through life, helps us understand Gladwell's key points, even though it is on a different level of impact than previous chapters.",1
"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",1
Four Stars. Great read,1
"Awesome read - gives you a new perspective on things. Awesome read - gives you a new perspective on things. The beginning reads a little bit like a text book, but be patient and stick it out till the end. You'll be glad you did.",1
"My favorite Gladwell book. I have read several of Malcolm Gladwell's books so far, and this is definitely my favorite. I also got the audiobook version and it's very well done. Highly recommend both versions, really provides some food for thought!",2
Its OK. Dry read.,0
"awesome book but i think he rushed the ending. I really lovedthe book.And the writimg is very very good and pleasant to read. I do think Malcom does miss an opportunity that perhaps he will work on in a secomd book. Malcom takes the long standing argument between librals and conservatives of accountability vs circumstance and supports enviornmental influences on peoples lives with very high quality arguments. I really appreciate the quailty of the reaarch and the well placed word while making the argument of nuture over nature. The point he misses is at the end he calls for change at the societal level and rebridges the gap between librals and conservatives. I think Malcom need to take his findings, keep the persuasion of the influence of the envioronment on success, but then focus on the HOW wnvironment was overcome and promote individual accountability to change not just societal pressures but personal or cultural changes that people have power over. I kept expecting that part two would show how thechange of Korean Airs saftey record was implenented, the hard choices to make cultural changes are to lightly pressed upon. Had he focused on How succesfull organizations (including familes) used the understanding of culture to change their outcomes or even understanding, Malcom would have briged the gap between liberals and conservatives and more than likely, over time exerted more influence of the necessary socitial changea he belives should be made.",1
"quick read but how much did you really learn from it?. Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.",0
"Very interesting. It just goes to show that to master your field that education, talent, intelligence, and luck all factor in. However, hard work brings it all together. A 10,000 hour commitment, are you willing to put in the work? How bad do you want it?",2
"A must read. Excellent book! It was my book club selection. When I heard it was a non-fiction about how to be successful I thought I would be bored. Well, was I wrong. I couldn't put it down. It was fascinating . I have recommended it to everyone I know.",2
Cheese. Cheese,0
Worth talking about. The subjects and stories spur discussions with co-workers and friends that continue as new readers join the conversation. The insights are thought provoking and coincidences surprising. I found it fun to read and difficult to put down. Any book that is talked about on a regular basis is better than most. It may no be life changing but it will certainly give you a new perspective on success and who is successful.,2
Re-frames Success. I have enjoyed every book Malcolm Gladwell has written - his style weaves real-life examples together to support some big ideas and the examples in Outliers are rather compelling. From Hockey Leagues to healthy towns - the concept of Outliers is illustrated perfectly.,2
"I didn't like this one nearly as much. I picked this up after reading Malcom Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point"". I didn't like this one nearly as much, but it was definitely still interestig. I couldn't put it down at points. I eneded up giving it to my buddy to read and he had good things to say about it too.",1
"Good read!. This book was different than what I expected; however, I still enjoyed reading it. I finished the book in about a week. It lets you know that all successes are achieved through a series of fortunate events and your core support team, such as your family.",1
"Helps to understad ""Outliers"". it is a great book, and helps us to build our ability to think about ""Outliers"". Though I read Tipping points by Gladwell, I really think Outlier wins. Malcom had done phenomenal job explaining the events and comparisons. Must read.",2
Wonderful and Informative. If you're a fan of sociology and cultural phenomena or just a curious person this is an excellent book. Gladwell has a jovial and knowledgeable way of explaining just about anything.,1
"This one is a weird one for me to write, and I’ll explain why. Without being unnecessarily reductionist, I used to think that there were two types of reactions to Malcolm Gladwell: you either hate him or love him. This was an opinion informed by my own experiences, having finished an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and psychology (an area Gladwell lives and breathes in). Graduate students, professors, and my own peers would be quick to talk up or talk down Gladwell upon hearing the name of",0
"Master-piece!. Great read! You should read Peak by Anders Ericsson, the man behind the 10 000 hour rule. According to Ericsson's research it does not take 10 000 to reach optimal level.",2
"Changing the way the world understands itself, one person at a time.. Malcolm Gladwell has something important to say. He makes an elegant case, employs agreeable logic, and is a colorful story-teller. Even if you disagree with his primary arguments, you will surely enjoy the craft of his artisans' prose, and learn something new.",2
Five Stars. Quite an interesting insight into prodigious people.,2
"A great Book for Outliers and Others. Another Malcolm Gladwell book, another delightful way to learn some fascinating facts. (I answered two questions on ""Jeopardy"" after reading this book--in my living room, not on the show.) He entertains and teaches at the same time, not an easy task. I tried for twenty years and finally gave up. Congrats, Malcolm.You have at least one devoted fan.",2
Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!. Whos GOT NEXT? this book if applied in your own life will take your personal or business life to the next level if you would but apply the principles in this book.,1
"Interesting Angle, But Acknowledge the Work Done. This is a great book and it definitely brings up some incredible points! It fails to hit on one important point though: the people discussed in the stories still had to put in an incredible amount of work. This point is barely touched on, almost passed over. Yes the people discussed had incredible opportunity thanks to the times and locations and even months they were born. But this is never enough. You still have to put in the work. The author almost makes it seem like anyone could have been Bill Gates born under the right conditions. I disagree. Not everyone with access to a computer in the late 1960’s would get out of bed at 2:30AM to program at 3:00AM. Plain and simple. The outliers are the people who engaged in incredibly hard work, and had some luck and help and opportunity along the way. The work still had to be done though. I agree with what the author is saying mostly, and yet I find it a bit discrediting to people’s achievements. I believe this is the other extreme of the individualism scale talking. Listen to the book and draw your own conclusions. Definitely a worthwhile read though and time well spent. Excellent book!",1
interesting. i think there could have been more example's of people that had great,0
"Nice book,. Nice book",2
None. No book,0
"Challenging conventional wisdom. This book is about challenging many of the ideas or bias we have about successful people, in particular, the people considered to be ""outliers"". For example, a lot people and parents think that talent and hard work is everything you need to success, and they could be right until certain degree, but the truth is that real outliers achieve success because there a lot of other additional factors contributing to their success besides innate talent and hard work.",2
"We All Have Some Help to the Way to Success. I loved this book because it gives some scientific insight into what a lot of us know from common sense. I know someone who has a genius IQ, but has never done anything useful with his life. This book shows how past a certain point, IQ doesn't matter in your overall success. I also know that because the cut-off date of my birthday, my parents chose to wait to start me in first grade until I was almost a year older than the other kids. Consequently, I was always ahead of the curve academically because of my age. I know other people whose parents chose to start them a little earlier in school, and they never catch up academically. This affects their self-image of being a success and they compare themselves unfavorably to other folks. I loved this book, it is fascinating and seems to prove a lot of the beliefs I already had.",2
"Good Read.... A lot of good research information to ponder over, for the reading enthusiast!! Ta-ta!",1
"I'm left feeling a bit meh.... The author has done his research which speaks to the strengths of this book. At times it was hard to keep abreast of the points the author was making. Just like my review, it could have been condensed.",0
"Three Stars. Interesting book, which provides a unique way of viewing thibgs.",0
"Outliers. As usual, Gladwell does an outstanding job of exposing the critical issues we face and how they are best dealt with.",2
Good. Excellent Read! Highly recommend! Arrived quickly. No issues,2
"Just buy the book!. An outstanding book that I would recommend to everyone - adults and teenagers. Everyone in my family is reading it. The insights the book highlights are simple now that someone has done the research to point them out. Enough said, buy the darn book and read it.",2
"Great and informative read when focused. I really liked this book. It took me a few months to read because I didn't find it as gripping as other writings, so I would often read a couple of books and come back to it. I challenged myself to focus over the last week and I'm so glad that I did. This was a wonderful book and it has opened my eyes to a better way of thinking about success.",1
Five Stars. I really enjoyed this book it is amazing,2
"Easy to read. The author reviews the aspects of successful profiles (known and unknown) not only from the education point of view but for all societal, historical and different points of view.",1
An important book. Makes a number of important points about human behavior and the path to success not vetted by others. Found it useful and interesting.,1
Five Stars. Very satisfied.,2
Cheese. Cheese,0
"Fun. Come on... It's great. Book Candy and sometimes a hoot. Sometime a ""?"""" but always Gladwell. Love it. More please!",1
"A simplistic tale on the causes of success. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is a tale about the causes of success. The book reads like a novel peppered with interesting tid-bits. The problem with many of his arguments is that they are too simplistic, often sensationalistic and unfounded. To economists or data analysts, ""Outliers"" feels like a case of literary curve fitting gone awry. Let me briefly outline point by point, how, many of the ideas of the book are simplistic.",0
great motivational read. quick and easy read - this will motivate you be be an 'outlier'.,2
"One of the I've read!. If success, opportunity, and privilege are themes that interest you, this book is for you. With entire chapters devoted to education, I encourage any teacher (especially math teachers) to pick this up and read it. I could not put it down. Highly recommend, it will change the way you see the world (and the way you see success)!",2
Interesting Concept. The book ended quite abruptly. I seemed as though the author had run out of viable arguments. The exposition of his thesis ended when the book was only 80% read. The rest was references. These are fine for verification of concept however do not add to the argument for me. I am interested in the author's theories and conclusions.,0
Well written and thought provoking.. Interesting read. Some of the points made are common sense but this books makes a good analysis of what successful people have in common. Definitely worth the time.,1
"Nice foundational read. Triumphant stories are much needed right now, people are looking for answers &amp; this book will help. Other great motivational stories are listed which I personally recommend to anyone.",1
Five Stars. Great,2
"A great read!. A very interesting and thought provoking read, thoroughly enjoyable!",2
"Maybe good for an entertaining read. Overhyped book. Maybe good for an entertaining read, but no robust information to add to anyone's wisdom.",0
"Outliers review. I purchased this book for my son's 11th grade summer reading for school. My son says this book is hard to follow, mostly because it tells different stories of peoples success, but has no continual story line. He really doesn't enjoy reading this book.",0
"Interesting thoughts, findings and conclusions.. Fascinating view on the intricacies of the environment that cultivates certain behaviors, traditions even the skin color resulting in people's lives being full of happiness or shallow decades and centuries after...",2
Fascinating. Excellent read would recommend reading it through twice. Now annoyed that my parents didn't have me earlier in the decade and later in the year,1
"Great insights, easy read. It's difficult to go wrong with Malcolm Gladwell.",2
"Success story. This book was recommended by a friend, who is very appreciative about where he came from. So I decided to read this book as educational tool for me as a coach.",1
"An informative, entertaining, yet droning novel. From the moment I began reading, I knew what I was in for. A book that spells out it's message in the title, while containing descriptive elaboration. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, in fact, there are a handful of sections that are truly fascinating. It just doesn't know where to go sometimes.",1
"... you stare and wonder at the images of the brilliant, the rich and famous asking yourself what life .... So you stare and wonder at the images of the brilliant, the rich and famous asking yourself what life would be like in their genes?",2
"Second Time I bought this book !!. This is the Second time I have bought this book. The first book was borrowed from me before I even finished it..... it made its way thru the family and now is being passed around to friends. ""Outliers"" is marvelous, and I can well understand why it has stayed on the best seller list for so long. This book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell, and now I look for everything he writes. I will start reading this again, from the beginning, and with any luck will be able to finish it before someone borrows this copy, too !!",2
Me.. It sucks so far...,0
"Inspiring but wrong. This is an entertaining (and somewhat convincing) book. However, when you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that most of Gladwell's work has been discredited by science and has no more bearing on Psychology than one's astrological sign.",0
"I personally didn't like that the author contributed a lot (maybe most) of .... I personally didn't like that the author contributed a lot (maybe most) of these people's success to luck. The stories were great and I enjoyed the writing as well, but I wouldn't necessarily agree with the author.",0
Eh..... This book was okay for awhile. I got bored with it halfway through. I suppose it's a philosopher type of thing.,0
"Not my favorite. I kept waiting for the meaning of the book until the last page. The facts were interesting, but I got very little from this book except that success takes time and commitment.",0
A review of Outliers. A Review of Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell,1
Brilliant!. Absolutely Enjoyed it! Intelligent,2
"A book that makes you rethink how your past and culture may affect you and how to act upon it. I liked about the book that it makes clear that great success stories involve a lot of factors and people, that one may overcome (or be blocked) their cultural and family barriers. A book for a self-improvement process that not everyone is ever ready to start.",1
Great work stays focused on the data not conventional wisdom. Great work original thinking that inspired susequent books such as matthew syeds black box thinking...,2
"Interesting read, not over the top.. A good read and insight into how some are successful and how other just don't get the same opportunities. We can miss the point that many have to make the opportunity become available to them. We have a or to do with seizing the opportunity.",0
Five Stars. My husband loved this book.,2
"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",0
Good book. Very good book and I enjoyed reading it. I would definately suggest this book to someone else. It was fun reading this book.,1
great. very nicely packaged. the book arrived in great condition and smelt really nice. 10/10 would buy again,2
"Extraordinary and very very good. The book may or may not be so original for the experts on the subject, but to me, it was extremely original, interesting, thought provoking, fun to read and revealing. I am a rather successful person myself who tries to understand the routes to success so that I can maybe try to lead my three children accordingly. Towards that end I found the book very very useful. Having read all his other books, I think Gladwell is a pathbraker. Congratulations. Thoroughly enjoyed every single page.",2
An interesting compilation of stats and possible correlations to determine .... An interesting compilation of stats and possible correlations to determine success. Other than an observant commentary on factors - not sure what you can get from this other than it helps to be in the right place at the right time.,0
"Practical knowledge, easy to read, good presentation.. Easy read, excellent presentation.",1
"Outliers: The Story of Success. Repeat and repeat of why the author thought people were a success or failure. A very boring book. As a very wise lady once said to me, ""There is no sense like common sense, or degrees as long as your arm and can't wash behind their ears!!!!",0
"Insightful, Yet Expected. I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.",1
a good read. good read - worth the £3 or so,1
"A must read book for those seeking life success!. Malcolm Gladwell is a thoughtful and knowledgeable writer of topics that make us all think about our lives as we know it. In Outliers, Gladwell explains that our environment and interactions shape us greater than we perceive. What do you believe?",2
Loved it. I loved this book. Its nice to see how some people became succesful. I would recommend this book for sure. Good reading material.,2
Recipe for success. Interesting consideration of successful people and groups of people. What advantages do they share or opportunities did they have/ take.,1
Outliers. Thought it was good. Made me think about my own life and certain advantages I have had. Definitely recommend this book.,1
Great Read. It was a great read and really had me thinking about a lot of life situations and they can either advance or hinder life opportunities.,1
"entertaining, informative book for parents of young children. I enjoyed the first half of this book more than the second half. Much of the book covers material that is pertinent to parents raising young children.",1
"interesting. very interesting concept, i liked this book a lot",1
Four Stars. Good book,1
a must read!. great book a must read!,2
"Outliers: Finally got around to reading it. Gladwell poses some interesting observations on successful people and what contributes to their success. Basically he says practiced skills, environment and timing are the common denominators. Being born in January, I was unlucky not to be Canadian.Read the book to understand why.",1
Five Stars. Great read and very thought provoking.,2
"Thought provoking read with interesting case studies. My favorite quote: ""Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky -- but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.""",1
"The X- Factors of Success. Talent is both overrated and underrated. The fact is this book uncovers just how luck and hard work account more for becoming successful than talent itself. Having said that, we also learn that talent is often squandered due to cultural and systemic restraints. Eye opening and fascinating to say the least!",2
another America has it wrong book from a Canadian. At first some of the examples are interesting but by the end you are sick,0
"The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks ma. The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born.  These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.  thought the first half of Outliers was interesting as Gladwell talks about months and years people are born that may factor into a person success.  was more or less bored reading the second half which discussed families, and locations that define how hard you are going to work to be successful.  I also did not agree some of the facts discussed in the second half. utliers is an interesting read.  I picked it because some of the other books I had been reading mentioned it.   I would be interested in some of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s other books.",1
Thank You. Interesting stories to read and values to learn are an important part of this book. Find your own meaning within these stories because each one is very different.,2
Outliers allows us to take a deeper look at the ingredients of success. In outliers we are exposed to the various factors that have contributed to the successes of a diverse set of individuals. It highlights the fact that no one is successful solely on the basis of their own work or talent. It exposes the true story behind success.,2
Outliers. Interesting facts to keep in mind for having more opportunities in life. Specially that we can improve with our efforts,1
good book. good writing,2
Fascinating book!. Fascinating book! This book has so many neat stories that are so fun to read. Especially helpful if you have a child with a summer birthday and are on the fence with whether to send them to Kindergarten at age 5 or not. This book helped me feel justified in my decision!,2
Inspiring. Fantastic inspiring and encouraging novel. As a student i find it very applicable to those learning and those who believe themselves knowledgable.,1
"An interesting read. A step back from the focus on personality and a humbling examination of the role of culture, chance and kindness in the making of those who achieve great things. Easy and enjoyable to read, I would recommend this book.",1
"Fascinating. Thought provoking and fascinating. A different look, a different approach to analyzing success. Thoroughly enjoyed it and want to read more of his books.",2
Stupidity goes unanswered. Mr. Gladwell needs to better understand the statistical significance of an outlier (and the definition of multicollinerity). Correlation of independent variables is skewing Gladwell's message and he doesn't even realize it.,0
Some particular aspects of stathistics. The outliers are aspects of the life of every day those in a particular moment become important for some motive.,1
Five Stars. Excellent product and service,2
"Outliers - A MUST Read. This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous ""Stories of Success,"" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created ""Outliers"" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule) and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",1
"An Outlying Success. Malcolm Gladwell creates an impressive argument about the story of success that will capture the attention of all readers.  His discussion reveals a deeper meaning behind what makes certain people successful and why others never succeed to their full potential. Gladwell's book will keep you talking for days about the pure luck of hockey players, the determination of the Beatles and the opportunity and passion of Bill Gates.  He will reveal the answers to common myths concerning IQ, math, and plane crashes, which are sure to be hot topics. These riveting accounts of success combined with Gladwell's unique style of writing and humor will surely entertain and inform his audience with a complex story of success.",1
Love it. Love it,2
A good eye opening book. Great read with very well researched examples. Written in a very gripping and flowing way. Makes it a very interesting read.,2
"Interesting. Though it was good information, different perspective to success. Captivating examples used. Good narration, easy listen.",1
Very different approach to success.. I love this kind of nonfiction audiobook. Never considered how cultural influences could become an obstacle to clear communication between pilots in the cockpit leading to a tragic mishap. Well researched writing.,1
"Didn't quite live up to expectations. I am a great fan of Malcolm Gladwell and had high expectations of this book having read both Blink and The Tipping Point. However, this book isn't quite in the same league.",0
Insightful and thought provoking. A very interesting and fresh set of principles that are likely keys to the differentiated performance of people. Ist may change the month(s) that people plan on having their babies born.,2
"Excellent book. Worth reading, highly recommended, great examples of how human persistence, hard work nad luck are much more important than sheer intelligence.",2
Pretty good. Nice book for motivation,1
A gift. The theory of the book lines up well with what I see happening in multiple organizations. Want to learn more.,1
"Great easy read!. Outliers was a far different look at how to become successful. His examples go into depth about the opportunities that successful people have had. It makes one reflect on - what am I going to spend my 10,000 hours on?",2
Great. Great page turner which is well written. Arrived fairly quick.,2
"A Humbling Look into the Reality of Success. An insightful examination of myriad factors and forces that pave the path to success. Lineage, sociocultural conditions, and education, leveraged by sheer determination of will and relentless pursuit of growth opportunities create outliers - those individuals whose success or accomplishments are evident to others. While they may have worked 10,000 hours to reach a specific goal (see Beatles story in the book), it took more than practice to achieve success.",2
"Thoughtful. This was an eye opening book, it was consistent and gave you the opportunity to self analyze and think the situations in the book for yourself. It was open minded, but it had a clear message. Certainly recommend for those who want to dig deeper into the meaning of success.",1
Glad I read it..... Glad I read it; made me think about the authentic life of those we find difficult to understand; not compelling.,0
Bought for college English 1301. Bought this book for my college English class and it is a very good read and a refreshing change of view to think about.,1
"Compelling thoughts. This book kept my attention the whole way through. It is an interesting study, the idea of success and the perception of that meaning. It is also thought provoking to analyze the contributing factors that are present in each individual story of what might be considered great success. And that those factors span across many demographics and vocations.",1
Three Stars. as expected,0
"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2
1) Sloppy methodology:,0
"Outliers, a success. This was a great insight into the world of success and the myth of the ""rags to riches, I did it all by myself story."" Gladwell explains that opportunities, timing, luck, &amp; cultural legacies all play a chief role determining if a person will be successful or not. He examines the opportunities presented to Bill Joy, Bill Gates etc and shows how the most successful people in the world would not have made it if certain events didn't happen the way they did. There are so many more ppl in the world with the capability of being successful who just don't succeed due to circumstances. The story at points was a bit scattered, but the overall message of success makes it worth it.",0
"Another brilliantly thought provoking read by the masterful Malcolm Gladwell. Amazing! He shines a new light on the ideal of what it is to be successful. By doing so it inspires the reader to take this new perspective and apply it to their own life and opportunities. Malcolm Gladwell never disappoints me as an author, and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this book.",2
"Excellent read. Thought this was going to teach me about success, instead it was an eye opener to something even better. Practical steps are not always required for a book to be great, the only we need sometimes is a change in mindset/ paradigm shift, and this book did that for me.",2
factual. Interesting data and in depth research provides insights that are logical and factually supported. Well organized and a fun read.,1
Three Stars. 1000 HOURS.... IT IS TRUE,0
"Thought provoking.. I really enjoyed this book however I don't think it goes far enough. Why aren't all the hockey players born in Jan,Feb,March?",2
"Absolute Must Read. Can't stop talking about it, months later.. I read this in the summer and would re-read chapters because I was fascinated with the stories/evidence. By far it is the most incredible dinner, business conversation piece I have ever read. People will be amazed when you ask them a question like: ""Do you know what ties together most of the Junior Hockey League Professional players?"" ""Do you know what causes most major airline crashes?""",2
Fun to read and enjoy authors growth. I have always enjoyed the content of Gladwell's books; but as he grows from a researcher to a world renound author his books are becoming more enjoyable to read. I look forward to reading his next book.,2
"Easy, quick and informative. This book was hard to put down. The ideas presented by Gladwell are approachable and very useful. The anecdotes are a little redundant but they serve to hammer his points home and by the end of the book you’ll find them well worth while. An easy, quick and informative read that I plan on revisiting",2
Superb book on understand the drivers of social mobility. I read it in 2 days. Truly inspiring and though-provoking. I cried on the chapter about the Christopher Langhans of the world and learned a great deal about parenting ( for future reference). I was challenged as an educator. I wish information like this was available when I was a teen and my parents would've been in their early 30s. I will use this as a tool in adjusting my social mobility.,2
"As a small business owner I had hoped to get .... As a small business owner I had hoped to get something out of this book that I could use myself. Since the bulk of the stories are about 19th century immigrants to NYC, I didn't get too much. I didn't take the stories as much more than an indication to look around and see what could be done to improve myself with the ideas and skills that I already have. Already doing that.",0
The book Outliers is a perfect book for those who want to be suc. The book Outliers is a perfect book for those who want to be successful because it takes you through a journey to your success.,1
Two Stars. It was OK. A little slow.,0
"One of the best reads I had all year. Hard to put down.. If you've read David & Goliath or Tipping Point, Malcolm takes us down a different and very thought-provoking road that explores what makes people successful and happy. It also showcases how humans interact with machines and their surroundings as Malcolm shows us why things (and people) failed or went wrong.",2
"The Building of exceptional Children. A book every parent of school age children should read. What does equality of opportunity really mean? Knowing how the game is played, and how that will affect your child's success is thought provoking. If you have a child with talents or abilities this book could help you maximize his chances for great success.",2
"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2
Another great book from Mr. Gladwell. After Tipping Point and Blink we have another great book.,2
One Star. Book is full of unsubstianted talk about research that the Author did not do.,0
Four Stars. Thank you,1
"Time and chance. ""The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but Time and chance happen to all,"" so says the Teacher in Ecclesiastes. Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.",2
"Outliers-Keith. Outliers is another insightful look by Malcolm Gladwell at what factors contribute to extraordinary performance by individuals in many walks of life. Not that you can take those insights and make yourself extraordinary, but you understand that there are opportunities that present themselves to you throughout your life that can make a difference, depending how you respond to them. A quick read that offers pause for reflection and a refreshing look at the dynamics of success.",1
Interesting book. I really enjoyed this book. it was eye opening to read about the different factors that led to success for people like Bill Gates. definitely recommend.,1
"A very nice read. This is such a nicely written book, that I finished it only in a week. The concepts are so mind-opening and it changes your perceptions of things totally. I would highly recommend it.",2
Very thought provoking. Really enjoyed the content but I wasn't thrilled with Gladwell's performance of it. Still very much worth the listen.,1
"An explanation of occurrences of phenomenal success. ....and why belief of our society as a true meritocracy is wrong. Often as a child, I was taught that this country is a place where one could pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be successful. I knew this was false narrative as some are never given the straps, and the boot is reserved for certain folks. Great read.",2
Five Stars. Great book!! Priceless!,2
Interesting book.. Perfect read.,1
"Intriguing Insight. Captivating scenarios- obviously immaculately researched. While time invested is a commanding observation, Forrest Gump may have summarized all with chocolate.",0
Good book with lots of information. Lots of information in the book that makes you reflect and understand how timing fits into many things. Also different pieces of history throughout the book.,1
"Brilliant.. I think that Outliers should be required reading in high school. It's not just insightful, it actually helps you understand how to succeed, and overcome obstacles you didn't even know you faced. Brilliant.",2
"Awesome read for motivation. I must admit starting the book with references on sports were not very interesting since I am not a sports fan, however the whole point was to reference how people's circumstances translates into an opportunity. With each example he gave, he backed it up with reasonable background information.",2
"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",2
Like alana. This is boring.,0
"Five Stars. Excellent information, easy to read and extensive research to illustrate concept presented.",2
"Another good Gladwell delivery. Gladwell delivers another great read with his simple and efficient perspectives. If you liked his earlier books, you will not be disappointed with Outliers.",1
"Bravo!. I'm a bit late to the Gladwell party, but definitely glad I came! Outliers was thought-provoking and a fast, excellent read. After reading several negative reviews that Mr. Gladwell has a tendency to over-simplify things, I think that those reviewers are missing the point. I believe several people have said that as well. I must be a simpleton because I'm having a blast reading all of his books. I finished Outliers, then I read The Tipping Point and now I'm reading Blink! Can't wait for David and Goliath! Bravo Mr. Gladwell, Bravo!",2
Product delivered quickly. Excellent condition,2
"Very thought provoking. Absolutely loved Outliers! Very well written and with so many fascinating points. I want to read it again to make sure I picked them all up! (Be aware that this is not a quick and easy read; it requires your full attention and time, but it's so incredibly rewarding and fulfilling!)",2
Great shape.. Thanks for the fast shipping and great item!,2
"an educator's look at success factors. This was an amazing research project as to what makes some people successful, however, the section on Korean pilots was too long and not relevant to me as an educator. The most relevant to me was looking at kids' birthdates and how it forced them into academic or athletic experiences they weren't mature enough to handle.",1
Gladwell has presented a series of functional and useful paths to success. Gladwell has presented a series of functional and useful paths to success. I look foreward for his further observations on the subjects.,1
"Gladwell is a Fabulous Narrator. The outlier theory is fascinating, and I appreciate the knowledge I gained from each and every story, but a few were a bit lengthy. Gladwell's voice, however, is smooth like jazz, soothing like a hot bath. I swear it was like one long massage for my ears. I could listen to him talk forever....",1
"Anecdotal evidence. This book has an interesting concept and is well written if one likes to read newspaper articles. Given its author, its not suprising it is crafted in a journalistic style. However, it was an interesting read that proposes a believable theory of how people succeed through practice and fortitude.",1
"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book. Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",0
Required MBA Reading. If you want an MBA you'd better read this book. If you already have an MBA you'd better read it.,1
"Makes you think. This book certainly makes you think and is enjoyable to read. It can open up a new way of evaluating how we look at successful people and how opportunity and circumstances shape our own lives. While some may argue that the book leaves success up to chance, I believe the author shows that it takes the combination of giftedness, work ethic, and the ability to take advantage of unique and incredible opportunities to be successful.",2
My personal review. What the author did with the book is what i liked about it.For example is where he tells us how the date of birth determines if you are going to be good in sports. Another example is where IQ isn't about everything you need to be smart. Like i was saying with the IQ it just doesn't always require an high IQ to be smart for example a layer you just don't need a hi IQ buts also a fast moving thinker so you can back up the defendant.,1
"A different book. I was told how good this book was so I purchased it. It is a different approach to the subject of doing well in ones work. It gives a good outlook on those who may not be considered ""winners"". It was a challenging book for sure and I would recommend it to all those who want to succeed in life.",1
"Stating the Obvious. Had high expectations about this book given its reviews and mention of how it would change one's life and make you feel clever. Unfortunately, none of that happened. ""Outliers"" should probable be best seen as a collection of anecdotes and observations...some interesting, some bland, many unrelated.",0
The book outlines the things needed for success. Great book. Gives a completely new perspective on successful people.,1
"Not my favorite. I kept waiting for the meaning of the book until the last page. The facts were interesting, but I got very little from this book except that success takes time and commitment.",0
Gladwell always a must read. Very easy reading and brings together all the those things you could see but couldn't quite put your finger on.,2
"Delivery. Despite paying extra for shipping, the book still took forever to arrive.",0
"I did not know that .... Read this book, as ever Gladwell sees behind the glitz of reported genius to show much is structural and the 10,000 hours applied to Bill Gates and The Beatles shows how they were ready to take up the opportunity which came their way. If you do not read this you will miss an opportunity for yourself.",2
"Really great read. I absolutely loved this book. It's clearly written, suspenseful and engrossing, it has great examples and overall taught me a lot. Great read, makes me want to work harder and have more grit, as well as hopefully figure out what innate advantages kids born in the 80s may have! 😀",2
"Entertaining and provides some food for thought, but don't take it too seriously. Some of the reviews here are as if not more interesting than the book itself! Mr Gladwell's Outliers is an interesting read to be sure. It is my first Kindle purchase and I read it in one night, so it is neither long nor difficult to digest in a short amount of time.",1
a good read. good read - worth the £3 or so,1
Gladwell’s unique perspectives are a gift. I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. None of his books disappoint and Outliers is no exception. If you enjoyed this or any of his other books I would recommend that you listen to his Podcast called “Revisionst History” it’s phenomenal.,1
"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",1
"interesting. Interesting, as all his writing has been.",1
Wonderful. Good book.,1
"A must read!!. Wow I love this book, I adore the author, this is, I believe, his best work.",2
super book. great author,2
"I'd like to find a way to include it in my .... This book is a must read. I'd like to find a way to include it in my curriculum at school. Especially the 10,000 hr rule. Students need to know these things as do the parents. Poor kids (and their parents) think if they dont get it right the first time they are failures at life, and this is being reinforced by parents and teachers. It breaks my heart! Thank you for writing this book and sharing these insights.",2
"Interesting pop science book - not scientfic, but is interesting. I thought this was a fascinating look into stories of success. What's key to notice is that although Malcolm Gladwell claims, or at least suggests, that he's looking at things scientifically, what he's really doing is telling stories. For instance, he doesn't really pin down what he means by success in the book, which makes the whole thing a bit tricky.",1
"Great Anecdotes and Insights, But Doesn’t Tie Back Together. Great anecdotes and insights, but the book doesn’t bother to tie these findings about circumstance back to the central theme of becoming a successful person or “outlier” yourself, which I assume is its mission. For some I imagine it would actually achieve the opposite goal, an existential fear of always being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” through its extreme determinist viewpoint. I still loved the book, but I think it may be harmful for certain people to think this way, especially if they weren’t very confident about themselves going in. [AUDIBLE]",0
"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",1
"One of the best I've read!. During a discussion during a recent checkup, my doctor recommended I read this book. It gave me a totally new way of looking at life and success. I now understand more clearly why some people seem ""luckier"" than others in their lives outcomes. Very eye opening. The Author is fantastic, and I love the way he closed with his personal story. I will read more from Gladwell!",2
Five Stars. perfect,2
"GOOD BOOK. Very interesting and motivational. I'm only writing this review to meet the twenty word requirement on the kindle review, so yea.",1
insightful indeed!. Story of success is a classic read and has been an eye opener for me. Success truly is not only result of luck or opportunity alone but what you do of the luck or opportunity...,1
"Educational leadership research. As a doctoral student, I was assigned this book. I now begin to analyze how it can be used for educators as they delve deeper into student and staff conversations. How can we use this knowledge to lift up students who we would otherwise put down and ignore?",1
Great read for an athlete. Very well written book to give any athlete.,2
"Nature vs Nurture. The debate of Nature versus Nurture is an old one. Hero culture, that idea of individual exceptionalism willed from “boot strap” beginnings, prevails heavily in the US. What this vision lacks is the detailed history and nuanced perspective on all of the circumstances that set up success in spite of all other factors.",2
"Thought Provoking. Gladwell has once again used his unique writing style, his meticulous research and his ability to tell a story to produce an eye opening and thought provoking book. I recommend this book to anyone who engages in out side of the box thinking.",2
Mostly fluff. Kind of a good book with the 10000 hour rule and everything but the rest is mostly fluff for me.,0
"Inspiring Read. Very good read, this book helped open my eyes and view the world in a different way. I always thought that rich amd successful people were born that way, I never knew that luck had such a big factor in it.",2
"Well written. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, probes .... Well written. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, probes into the backgrounds of several successful individuals (plus one band) to identify what it is that has led to their success. What he finds is a relatively consistent pattern of conditions, choices and effort. My takeaway was the importance of reflection and mentorship in the lives of others.",2
"Causes one to stop and think. Really an interesting read! I can't quite ""buy"" some of his theories but it is so thought-provoking that I passed it along for all my adult kids to read, too.",1
"Very Interesting. Gladwell does looks at things in a way that many people don't. There isn't one cause to success as more of a sequence of events, timing, and luck. Recommended.",2
"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",2
Good. Was an interesting read. New insights to ponder on success. I found some of the stories and points a bit too repetitive at times.,0
