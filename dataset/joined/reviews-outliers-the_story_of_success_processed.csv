0,0,"Journalism and pseudoscience. Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",2017-11-12,Reino Unido
1,1,"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",2018-03-03,Reino Unido
2,1,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",2014-06-23,Reino Unido
3,1,"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2019-01-17,Reino Unido
4,1,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",2020-02-18,Reino Unido
5,1,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2018-09-01,Reino Unido
6,0,"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2014-08-17,Reino Unido
7,1,"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",2017-09-10,Reino Unido
8,1,"Worth a read. Malcolm Gladwell has a storytelling style that makes for compelling reading, albeit based around 'one big idea', in this instance 'grit'.",2022-03-05,Reino Unido
9,1,Wouldn’t it all boils down to one philosophy?. It’s a 5-star research work. That’s all.,2020-07-17,Reino Unido
10,1,Extraordinary. Every chapter should be read. Each one reveals interesting stories built from dissecting facts and discovering true causes.,2018-11-29,Reino Unido
11,1,"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2021-12-28,Reino Unido
12,0,"A great book if you believe it's pointless trying to excel in life, as the odds are against you. I never leave reviews, but this book is a travesty. I am blown away and confused over the positive reviews this book has received.",2022-01-27,Reino Unido
13,1,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement. This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,2021-02-10,Reino Unido
14,1,"We can all be outliers and this book explains how!. What is an Outlier? How do people become outstanding in their field? Are the born with a skill? Do you have to learn a skill? Do you have to be born at the right time? Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”? The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time. Were they the brightest or the best? As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",2019-12-16,Reino Unido
15,1,"Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right. I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",2022-03-12,Reino Unido
16,1,"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",2017-10-01,Reino Unido
17,1,"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",2019-09-03,Reino Unido
18,1,"Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",2014-12-23,Reino Unido
19,1,"Food for thought. Outliers is my book of the year so far. I know I'm late to the party, but it really made me think. I'd heard most of it's ideas before (partly because it's been so successful), but never expressed this clearly, and accessibly, and all together.",2018-11-10,Reino Unido
20,1,Essential reading. Everyone need to read this book.,2021-09-05,Reino Unido
21,1,"Epic. Excellent book. Particularly recommended for teenagers (and their parents) who wonder why they might be under-performing or what they will end up doing with their life. It is full of 'A ha"" moments When I first started reading it I wasn't enthralled but as the author started to show connections and underlying situations that build up to success, I was really impressed.",2019-03-31,Reino Unido
22,1,"Not what I expected but a great read!. I was expecting a self help book on trying to be sucessful. No dont be mislead this is a book not telling you have success in your own control but rather the opposite. Its still a great book, that is written amazingly with some really relevant and interesting examples. The chapter on Bill Gates is a story I have found myself telling others about",2021-04-23,Reino Unido
23,1,"Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is. This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view. As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages. It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",2019-09-17,Reino Unido
24,1,"A good book. A better read than i thought it would be. I purchased this as the kindle daily deal and thought it might be ok but not that good, but i was wrong. It's a great book and i enjoyed it a lot. Some great arguments on why people achieve success, hard work obviously, but luck and circumstances also key factors, as explained in book.",2017-06-19,Reino Unido
25,1,Not what I expected. I had seen this title recommended by a few sources and thought I should give it a try.,2020-04-09,Reino Unido
26,1,"I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if .... Although the author Tries to make you look twice at what you thought were life's predestinations, it does so by choosing very precise close space situations and drawing conclusions from them. I would normally say it is dangerous to draw a universal law of things from such a finite number of observations.",2017-11-08,Reino Unido
27,1,"Much more than 10,000 hours. I came to this book for it popularising the 10,000 hour theory - some say over-simplifying. I was surprised and then delighted to find that is just one reference in a book drawing together many insightful ideas to unpick the myths of what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field. But as Malcolm Gladwell reveals, there are other factors, many beyond our control, which should keep us humble if successful and tolerant of those who missed out. I look forward to reading his other books.",2021-10-09,Reino Unido
28,1,Really interesting book about how luck & hard work plays a key part in success. I found that I couldn't put this book down.,2018-07-13,Reino Unido
29,1,Enjoyable read. Having read reviews for and against the book I thought I would read it - especially as it was a Kindle special. It's an easy read and although a little repetitive I did enjoy it and do think he makes some good points. In the end it's probably a little too simplistic in its conclusions but that doesn't spoil it as a good book.,2017-07-27,Reino Unido
30,1,"Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes. This book is full of interesting stuff: From why one rural community in the US had amazing health to how plane crashes happen. It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance. (Try also reading Mindset by Carol Dweck.)",2020-02-05,Reino Unido
31,1,Interesting and thought provoking. Pulling together multiple strands of experience and narrative into a single whole is done well. I certainly hadn't quite realised the extent to which our dates of birth affect life chances of individuals.,2018-09-24,Reino Unido
32,0,"A bit boring. I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book. To be honest it’s a bit boring and author goes around same subject again and again. We stoped reading midway through. I don’t know may be it is a matter of taste, but we didn’t like it.",2019-05-16,Reino Unido
33,1,"Amazing. The best book I have ever read. Such an amazing mix of humour, adventure and life. Interesting from the first word",2019-09-08,Reino Unido
34,1,Why are great people great? They take the opportunities given. Great book. Easy read. Hits home his point again and again and gives many case studies of “success”.,2018-02-04,Reino Unido
35,1,Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,2020-05-17,Reino Unido
36,1,"Fantastic (but don't read it before a flight). The author has that unique skill of being able to view and interpret the World exactly as it is, not tinted by any preconceptions or expectations. His 10,000 hr rule, from my personal experience, is bang on. I found this book was similar in vein to Freakonomics which I also recommend, and Tipping Point has also been on my list for a while so I will definitely be reading that sometime soon.",2015-10-27,Reino Unido
37,1,"Will make you question who you are. This book will make you question who you are - where you come from, what's your legacy, and what helped you accomplish whathever you've achieved so far in your life. It will also make you ask, do I have 10,000 hours of experience in something so far? Recommended read.",2019-09-05,Reino Unido
38,1,"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories.

39,1,WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,2017-12-01,Reino Unido
40,1,"Fascinating. I loved this book. At first there appear to be lots of statistics and facts but this quickly emerges as an overall theme which underpins the development of understanding generally, the ingredients which can lead to success.",2020-11-19,Reino Unido
41,1,It started strongly then rambled a bit. The insights in the first part of the book about reasons for outliers were amazing but it probably would have been a better book if it had been shorter. Some of the later chapters weren’t as interesting.,2022-03-12,Reino Unido
42,1,"An honest look at success.. I have hope that even this late in the game of life I can forge a path to great success. This book has helped me understand that my background plays a key role in why I feel I have struggled with success as an entrepreneur. I feel inspired to collect data based on my own life, study the patterns, and give myself the chances that were absent from my familial and cultural legacies. Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell, for this meaningful gift.",2021-02-05,Reino Unido

49,1,Read This. Absolutely brilliant and informative. No need to say more other than read it for yourself . Very well written and laid out,2019-10-05,Reino Unido

52,1,"Impossible to put down. I highly recommend this book its such an eye opener, its hard to pin point which part is the best. You will enjoy every page.",2020-02-02,Reino Unido
53,1,"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",2013-05-28,Reino Unido
54,1,Brilliant!. An interesting account of some of the world greatest and those outliners that may be less known. The book was gripping from start to finish.,2017-10-14,Reino Unido
55,1,"Great read.. This was an interesting book, that grabbed me from the first line. Gladwell provides logical reasoning and sense behind his ""theory / arguments"". Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting. What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way. Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",2014-07-19,Reino Unido
56,1,A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,2014-11-21,Reino Unido

65,1,"Very engaging. I had read Bounce (Outliers came first) and much of the same studies are repeated in this book so I skipped a lot. But if you haven't, it's a good read and really makes you think about the nature of success and talent. It would be an interesting one for a book club as it offers much to debate such as about nature/nurture, social mobility and how advantageous our beginnings are.",2014-08-07,Reino Unido

320,0,"quite longwinded and not telling stories that a person can use for their own success. This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'. It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies. I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",2020-07-18,Canadá

I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?!

The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",2019-11-14,Austrália

374,1,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.",2016-03-14,Canadá
375,1,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2015-11-05,Canadá
376,1,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck. It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary. For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced. Based on your astrological sign! That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older. And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference. That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children. Is that fair? No. It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up. Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year. That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2009-11-05,Canadá

One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret. It means looking at ourselves, at work habits, our cultural legacy and asking ourselves some hard questions. Gladwell's thesis is inescapable and puts the responsibility on each of us to create a better world and a better self.",2017-03-03,Canadá

545,0,"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",2015-11-16,Reino Unido

551,1,"Interesting and thought provoking. This book was recommended to me by Amazon (thanks, BTW), and I found it an interesting and insightful read.

One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind."" Carson emphasized that despite all odds he was able to pull himself out of poverty and become a neurosurgeon and accomplish the things he did.",2017-07-03,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell is uniquely gifted in being able to first identify common assumptions and beliefs of social importance that are in fact questionable, then to make inspired connections that build a case for a contrarian perspective, and finally to present the evidence in a totally compelling, non-patronising and inspirational way. I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance.

It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",2017-08-18,Reino Unido

He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line.

Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book. On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!! There are plenty of examples today so leaving out half the population is unacceptable. Leaving out half of the population also makes it easy to justify your argument!",2017-03-21,Canadá

592,1,"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book.

594,1,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2018-09-26,Estados Unidos

602,1,"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards.

There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747).

611,1,"Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!. “Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point. Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it.

Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies.

In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there.

Gladwell explains why some people achieve great success while some other, equally gifted and hardworking people do not. Gladwell posits that success is based on a unique set of circumstances that are outside of the successful person's control and then does a pretty good job of proving his point. While he never dismisses the factors of effort, talent and hard work, he does put these in perspective and the context of unique opportunity.

625,1,Outliers are less mythic than we think in the end. Always historicize is a dictum espoused by Fredric Jameson and other cultural critics when it comes to understanding phenomena. Malcolm Gladwell here adds to the materiality of success as a phenomenon that is essentially not abnormal or irrational—the oddity of success can be historically explained if we keenly study the opportunities made available to a seeming outlier. Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out. Gladwell’s seeming unwillingness to do the academic dance expected of scholars is refreshing: He’s a popular cultural critic who seems to want to make academic inquiry and discovery a layman pursuit.,2018-09-09,Estados Unidos

Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",2019-06-27,Estados Unidos
628,1,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",2015-02-10,Estados Unidos
629,1,"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them.

The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5.

People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",2013-09-22,Estados Unidos

It reinforces the fact that the most gifted people literally had time, sources of opportunity, used their abilities to negotiate for what they need, and literally took advantage of the number of hours in a day to get ahead. Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting).

Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",2014-11-07,Estados Unidos

654,1,"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application.

On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens. I may never be as great as some of the individuals discussed in Outliers, but there is no reason to think that I can’t be on a success trajectory of my own, putting in my time practicing hard, thankless work, or cashing in on the values of my great-grandparents.

This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are.

In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too. The one thing I feel that I struggle against daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school.

""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"".

The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper.

729,1,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed. The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair. Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November. It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year. Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children. They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year. However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year. As the school years pass, the gap widens. A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform. Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",2011-01-25,Estados Unidos

No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders. Its all about the parents. We are the creators of our own children's destiny.

It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table.

This does a fabulous job of showing how some of our most famous cultural icons, like Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, and the Beatles, succeeded to the level of great fame and fortune not just through individual effort. Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan). There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.

Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck. I agreed with everything in the book. It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control. Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against. That is unfair.

Although business-inclined folk might see this as a challenge to their tenets (hard work and talent = success), to me, it felt invigorating. It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work. It will tell you that the road to success is convoluted and sometimes hidden in plain sight.

The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book.

The central message percolating within Outliers is the context of one's life must never be ignored nor given short shrift. But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled? We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person. How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives? Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success? Do we really have a handle on that? Was Stalin a success because he got the metro system in place in Moscow? Was Micky Mantle a success because he built a Hall of Fame career?

It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place.

But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",2009-01-11,Estados Unidos

But they don’t. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are.

818,1,"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",2017-09-25,Estados Unidos
819,1,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful.... I really enjoyed the diverse fields and examples from which Gladwell draws to make his points. I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York). Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds. Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct. Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis. A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",2014-01-14,Estados Unidos

855,1,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer. You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories. But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""? The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point. Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past. You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"". Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech. And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous. Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success. Surely the successful need to ""share their success"". Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals). This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",2013-02-28,Estados Unidos

I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read.

The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in the roots or causes of success. Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact."" Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing. According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot.

885,1,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",2009-07-12,Estados Unidos

There are key ingredients, he says, such as being in the right place at the right time, receiving extra tutoring/training, and additional opportunities. Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc?

However, the author strategically does this to build the plot and the theme behind the entire book. The way we analyze outliers and success stories in general, is completely flawed. Gladwell provides numerous examples as to why our mindset is flawed and backs it up with irrefutable research from different fields. If you're a hard worker but feel like you just can't seem to find a break, then this book is for you. Not only will it motivate you but it will refuel your persistence in the goal of ultimately achieving success.",2016-01-26,Estados Unidos
902,1,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",2011-07-24,Estados Unidos

As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful.

911,1,"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening. I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging. He was right. Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance. In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary. Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts. Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control. These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",2011-09-05,Estados Unidos

For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field.

The more dedicated to their education, the ""smarter"" these students become. The message delivered by Mr. Gladwell is music to my ears. I have quoted his stories in all of my classes to extremely receptive audiences. I heartily endorse this book for students of all ages.",2008-12-22,Estados Unidos

This is a trippy little book that amused me with its many ""aha"" moments. Many of the detractors have given this book a low rating due to the fact that some of the findings are not new. For the semi-illiterate such as me - that's OK. I haven't read the other books referred to so I found Outliers FASCINATING! I knew that the kids of my Asian friends were better at math than my kids - I just never knew why. I thought Bill Gates was just lucky as well as smart. I didn't know he'd paid his dues, and paid and paid and paid. I'd heard about all the rich old guys of the 1800's but didn't see any commonality until Gladwell pointed out their birth years.

996,1,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",2012-02-22,Estados Unidos

I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",2010-05-25,Estados Unidos

For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line.

The stories about hockey players and how the slight difference in age gives the slightly older boy tremendous advantage were particularly enlightening.,2014-04-15,Estados Unidos
1003,1,"If you don't know what success ""is"", you cannot prepare for it. Having read all of Gladwell's popular titles I see the continuation of his endless quest for the answer to ""why"". The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited.

The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",2012-03-23,Estados Unidos

Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2012-08-04,Estados Unidos
1008,1,"Outliers is Outstanding!. In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary.

Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",2009-05-26,Estados Unidos

1035,1,Insightful analysis with many great examples. This book was recommended to me by one of my friends as a mind blowing experience and it was absolute true.

I'd recommend this book to all the leaders and parents and probably would recommend a simplified version of it to be read and tought to all kids.,2016-12-31,Estados Unidos
1036,1,"View-changing read!. This book was given as a reading assignment in my college English class. At points it made me angry about my life and what I had been given, through no choice of my own. I kept reading and I finally realized that this book allowed me to understand life as I know it. Gladwell writes to entertain and inform. Not once did I find it dull.",2014-10-01,Estados Unidos
1037,1,"Outstanding book. But where do I go from here?. This very thought provoking book helps describe how some famous outliers were able to take advantage of the opportunities timing, culture, and hard work gave them. I read this genre of books to help stimulate ideas to help me rise above my own circumstances, or at least be able to help my own children rise above their own. As historic information the hind sight we can gather from this book doesn't help me recognize future opportunities for myself or my progeny. However, the idea of cultural influence having a significant role over these outliers and how that came about was well worth the price of the book.",2014-08-09,Estados Unidos

Loved this journalist's talent ...superb and masterfully prepared, engaging stories all to highlight some common thread. Each chapter is a keynote feature of some intriguing theme. My favorite was the over-arching idea that some things are just outside of the norm and probing all the possible takes of WHY that is. Hence the title. Now, the most visual of story-tellers takes you into many time periods and cultures and slices of professions in order for you to see his perspective and buy into his philosophy. It is part history, science, statistics and A TON of human interest all blended with an honest voice the reader trusts. Finished this one in hours.",2014-08-11,Estados Unidos

Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.",2013-09-28,Estados Unidos
1041,1,BEST BOOK EVER. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It assaulted interesting things with evidence supporting every idea and it makes you question the way we view certain aspects of everyday life.,2018-06-17,Estados Unidos
1042,1,"A Self-Help Book You Can't Pass Up!. Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is. Reading this book will give you an entirely different outlook on not only the world around you but also our worlds history and how today has come to be. This book is a #1 national bestseller for a reason and you will not regret making the decision to read it!",2012-02-21,Estados Unidos

1046,1,"This is a great read, a must-read. It automatically became one of my top ten books. Gladwell has a unique way to tell interesting stories.

1047,1,"One of the most fascinating reads ever. Unless your offended by being called a *#&5*#$%.. fascinating book. As a southerner, though, I, too, would want to fight any jerk who called me what provoked southerners in a test that Gladwell writes about. Wish he would get the guts or whatever, to do the same instead of telling us southerner to adjust our behavior. Never be a gimp and tell someone how to act!",2015-08-07,Estados Unidos
1048,1,Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. This book is a really good reminder that hard work can pay dividends. Most of what is seen as talent is actually the product of earlier training and practice. You don't have to be porn in the top few precent of IQ to achieve at the top of your field.

1055,1,"This book is an outlier.. This is one of my favorites in my personal library. I especially love the ""10,000 hour rule"" in the book which suggests that no matter your level of talent or genius it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become world-class in your discipline or skill. He explains why even geniuses like Mozart were not exempt from this rule. The title does not over-promise but it delivers in content.",2016-03-14,Estados Unidos

1057,1,"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",2014-01-09,Estados Unidos

It covers a wide range of interesting topics and many of the thought provoking concepts have spurred excellent conversations with my kids as well my peers at work.

1062,1,"Informative. This is my first time reading this Author. This book was very informative about success and the true stories behind it. I liked the book very much and the thought that the author did a fair comparison of all angles of a successful persons life like, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there. The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention. This book is not only educational but also entertaining. Reading his other book now called Blink and I am almost done with it. I will say that I like this book better than I like Blink.",2011-08-28,Estados Unidos
1063,1,"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself. In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount. One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself. Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately. I agree with the premise of the book to a point. While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors. By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",2017-01-13,Estados Unidos

1070,1,Readability. Quite enjoyable read,2020-01-13,Estados Unidos
1071,1,Interesting Nonfiction. The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life. It reads almost like a fiction book. The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened. He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,2013-05-20,Estados Unidos
1072,1,"First-rank work by Gladwell again. This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress. Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book. Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.) There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground. Easily one of the most important books of the last 10 years, imho.",2009-01-19,Estados Unidos
1073,1,"Outstanding Outliers. This is equal to Gladwell's Tipping Point and better than Blink. It contains fabulous, specific examples of how brilliance is often a factor of early opportunities available to some and not others, from hockey stars to Bill Gates. The book slows toward the end, it seems as if there is filler to make it long enough for hard cover, and I can also make a case that the brilliance is in taking advantage of the opportunities that others ignore or don't appreciate. But it's a provocative, fine read.",2009-02-12,Estados Unidos

It is a great book if you have young children and want to help set them up for future success (my opinion). He covers a number of topics from sports to business and why some people in those arenas have been so successful. Some of it is God-given talent, but there is another component that you will be surprised (or maybe not) to learn by reading this book. Great read.",2013-10-29,Estados Unidos

I learned a few interesting facts about what outliers are and, perhaps more importantly, some ways to make just about everyone perform at the ""outlier level"". I suppose many of the observations in the book could be considered common sense. But until someone like this author points out what's happening that common sense is never engaged.

Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion. By backing it up with analysis and multiple cases, creditability results. There is a strong enough case established to make his views worth reading and thinking about.",2014-11-08,Estados Unidos
1097,1,"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously. It is well written and very thought provoking. Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society. Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion. My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success. The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook. Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely. This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions). Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W. Bush -- does anyone think that he would have been president if not for Daddy Bush and the family and life circumstances he was born into?!",2010-03-16,Estados Unidos

While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",2015-06-29,Estados Unidos

This author's understanding of the value of both the Terman study and psychological testing is so poor, that it is clear that he only used this information to make his point. He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential. He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking. He needed to understand far more about what he was writing.

This book was required reading for my high schooler this past Summer Break (but I got to it first). Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here. The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting. Convincing, great food for thought. The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time. I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages. (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.) For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research. This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education.

In one book Malcolm Gladwell put the years of life experiences of very successful people in this country and abroad. He showed how important to work your 10.000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. You can be born a genius, but you'd accomplish nothing, if you won't work hard, but if you are working hard and long hours, the success would come to you.

For example, Gladwell looks at,”Demographic Luck” (a.k.a the effect of one’s birth date). Gladwell shows that your birth date can affect whether or not you make a sports team or become smarter than someone else.

Talent by itself will not get you to where you want to be in life. Hard work by itself will not get you where you want to be in life. Opportunities by themselves will not get you where you want to be in life. But if you combine talent, a good work ethic, opportunities, and being born or growing up at the right time, can lead you to a very successful life.

The real point is, it's inspiring. Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity. Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable. I think it's a good estimate of the truth. I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.

It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few.

1420,1,"Interesting and entertaining read. Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful. Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point. He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality. The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",2009-09-27,Estados Unidos

Another example is where IQ isn't about everything you need to be smart.

How did Bill Gates become a billionaire? And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes.

1629,1,"Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review. The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this. I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage, to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific.

The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.

It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part.

This is definitely a hit, starting with the excellent analysis of why so many ice hockey stars seem to be born early in the year and moving on to easy to read but insightful discussion of success in a range of fields. It's never boring, not a word wasted but is worth the price of purchase alone for the chapter titled ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"", which is about as stunning a chapter as I've read in non-fiction.

Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses. But this book was different. Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times. It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help. Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family. I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had. It was all there. The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.

1899,1,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",2011-04-21,Estados Unidos

1905,1,"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",2010-06-21,Estados Unidos

The book may or may not be so original for the experts on the subject, but to me, it was extremely original, interesting, thought provoking, fun to read and revealing. I am a rather successful person myself who tries to understand the routes to success so that I can maybe try to lead my three children accordingly. Towards that end I found the book very very useful.

1927,1,"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected. You can also see the influences of his family in his life. His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician. Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha). Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success. Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",2015-03-08,Estados Unidos

When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell. Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience. Many books are a great read. How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come? To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance.

But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",2010-04-29,Estados Unidos

The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me. The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",2009-01-04,Estados Unidos

While I am one who believes success can be attained through hard work, there are other factors that play into success, such as talent. Gladwell tries to dispel this, but in the process places himself in a corner. He claims talent is a small pool, and then uses a small pool that are not talented to argue against.

2176,0,"Journalism and pseudoscience. Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",2017-11-12,Reino Unido
2177,1,"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few).

2178,1,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",2014-06-23,Reino Unido
2179,1,"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2019-01-17,Reino Unido
2180,1,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",2020-02-18,Reino Unido
2181,1,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2018-09-01,Reino Unido

Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2014-08-17,Reino Unido

As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half.

My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style.

The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field.

It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck.

2214,1,"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories.

2215,1,WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,2017-12-01,Reino Unido
2216,1,"Fascinating. I loved this book. At first there appear to be lots of statistics and facts but this quickly emerges as an overall theme which underpins the development of understanding generally, the ingredients which can lead to success.",2020-11-19,Reino Unido
2217,1,It started strongly then rambled a bit. The insights in the first part of the book about reasons for outliers were amazing but it probably would have been a better book if it had been shorter. Some of the later chapters weren’t as interesting.,2022-03-12,Reino Unido
2218,1,"An honest look at success.. I have hope that even this late in the game of life I can forge a path to great success. This book has helped me understand that my background plays a key role in why I feel I have struggled with success as an entrepreneur. I feel inspired to collect data based on my own life, study the patterns, and give myself the chances that were absent from my familial and cultural legacies. Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell, for this meaningful gift.",2021-02-05,Reino Unido
2219,1,"Four and a half stars. A good book that reveals how success is more related to history and circumstance than it might at first seem,especially in cases of success that are often put down to genius.",2020-12-01,Reino Unido
2220,1,"Fascinating. I enjoyed reading this book and it's study of the ""self made man""/genius myth very much. A fascinating insight drawn from the author's personal experience and background.",2020-05-31,Reino Unido
2221,1,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Easy to read book, well researched and a page turner. Uses world class examples that everyone can relate to and people who we all know. Absolutely love it! I particularly liked all the research that went into it without it being too high brow a book. 💯",2018-05-27,Reino Unido

2229,1,"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",2013-05-28,Reino Unido
2230,1,Brilliant!. An interesting account of some of the world greatest and those outliners that may be less known. The book was gripping from start to finish.,2017-10-14,Reino Unido
2231,1,"Great read.. This was an interesting book, that grabbed me from the first line. Gladwell provides logical reasoning and sense behind his ""theory / arguments"". Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting. What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way. Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",2014-07-19,Reino Unido
2232,1,A very thought provoking read!. This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today. Some sections were extremely interesting indeed and whilst understanding what Gladwell is trying to convey some sections were a little 'long winded' and 'too American' for my specific interest needs.,2014-11-21,Reino Unido

2241,1,"Very engaging. I had read Bounce (Outliers came first) and much of the same studies are repeated in this book so I skipped a lot. But if you haven't, it's a good read and really makes you think about the nature of success and talent. It would be an interesting one for a book club as it offers much to debate such as about nature/nurture, social mobility and how advantageous our beginnings are.",2014-08-07,Reino Unido

What's key to notice is that although Malcolm Gladwell claims, or at least suggests, that he's looking at things scientifically, what he's really doing is telling stories. For instance, he doesn't really pin down what he means by success in the book, which makes the whole thing a bit tricky.",2009-02-03,Reino Unido

This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'. It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies. I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",2020-07-18,Canadá

I followed that expectantly with ""blink"" - this never seemed to get anywhere and has left me with little recollection of what it was all about. So I had hopes for better things with ""Outliers"" - the subject matter sounded interesting ""Stories of Success"" (whilst choosing to overlook some less than glowing reviews here.",2010-05-31,Reino Unido
2538,1,"Friendly style and simply brilliant, buying copies for friends!. What I really love about this book is the way Malcolm Gladwell 'speaks' to the reader. I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?!

The fascinating way of demonstrating how different so called outliers outperformed others is clear, scientifically based and analysed very well. The style of the chapters is good and follows scientific appears with results explained and critiqued by Gladwell. I certainly recommend this book to all people who are keen to learn about the reasons behind succcess and to consider all factors lead to that ( your own genius, your heritage, culture, parents, social privileges, colour, religion and the list goes on).",2019-11-14,Austrália

2550,1,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.",2016-03-14,Canadá
2551,1,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2015-11-05,Canadá
2552,1,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck. It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary. For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced. Based on your astrological sign! That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older. And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference. That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children. Is that fair? No. It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up. Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year. That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2009-11-05,Canadá

One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret. It means looking at ourselves, at work habits, our cultural legacy and asking ourselves some hard questions.

2721,0,"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",2015-11-16,Reino Unido

One of the first things I realized in reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell is that his position is diametrically opposite from that of Dr. Ben Carson, who through his campaign for the presidency stated that ""poverty is a state of mind.""

I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes! And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance.

It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",2017-08-18,Reino Unido

He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line.

Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book. On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!! There are plenty of examples today so leaving out half the population is unacceptable. Leaving out half of the population also makes it easy to justify your argument!",2017-03-21,Canadá

2768,1,"OK Read/ AWESOME Message of Hope. I received the book in the mail yesterday, and I'm almost done. It's a very easy read. The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability. That being said, the book gave me hope. It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone. Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring""). Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose. We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection. Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening. As I said, I've not yet completed the book. Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",2017-11-09,Estados Unidos

Literally, go take the bus and have a conversation with any stranger and you'll find that to be more rewarding of an experience. I can't believe it has such an astounding reputation.

2770,1,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success.

This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand.

Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes.

Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it.

Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies.

Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out.

Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",2019-06-27,Estados Unidos
2804,1,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",2015-02-10,Estados Unidos
2805,1,"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them.

But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.

Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting).

Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",2014-11-07,Estados Unidos

2830,1,"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",2013-11-22,Estados Unidos
2831,1,"Interesting and Empowering. This book is great not just because it challenges preconceived notions of success, but because it forces one to re-evaluate his or her own story of success. On the one hand, it can be humbling to admit that my social and cultural backgrounds play such huge roles it what I’d attributed to my own inherent greatness. On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens. I may never be as great as some of the individuals discussed in Outliers, but there is no reason to think that I can’t be on a success trajectory of my own, putting in my time practicing hard, thankless work, or cashing in on the values of my great-grandparents. As with all of Malcom Gladwell’s books, he first changes the way we think about certain things, and we then have the rest of our lives to build on what it means to think differently.",2020-10-13,Estados Unidos

Malcom Gladwell also explains from many different angles why Outliers are not simply the ones with amazing genetics as it requires many forces to become an Outlier, including pure luck and timing.

2838,1,Gladwell's Best Book. Probably Gladwell's most entertaining book. We all love a good success story. A story about cases where people go from nothing to overwhelming and legendary status. This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are. The conditions that were out of their control that they luckily fell into. You also learn of the extraordinary amount of work they also had to put in. A great read.

2840,1,"Not the Whole Story But a Great Start. As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too. The one thing I feel that I struggle against daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.",2013-07-14,Estados Unidos

All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else?

The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise. As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur.

Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks.

The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.",2012-12-20,Estados Unidos

It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported.

Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over. Advantages they inherently had. He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying. He picks great examples and this really helps the book.

The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",2009-05-22,Estados Unidos

I chose ""Outliers"" just to read something else by this author. I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one. I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered. Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception. I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe. I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later. You won't be sorry.",2014-03-13,Estados Unidos
2905,1,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed. The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair. Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November. It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year. Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children. They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year. However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year. As the school years pass, the gap widens. A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform. Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",2011-01-25,Estados Unidos

No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders. Its all about the parents. We are the creators of our own children's destiny. And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG! its us. No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it? its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are.

It's not about luck and I don't know if it can be taught, but it's much harder to get our children moving in the right direction when they have to go through our uninspired school system and even harder to inspire them to greatness if they begin believing in the ""system"" as the way there.

Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan). There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.

It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.

It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work. It will tell you that the road to success is convoluted and sometimes hidden in plain sight.

The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book.

We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person.

It was a good read, but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case.

2951,1,"Fascinating stuff. This book had been recommended by a friend, and since I had read Gladwell's THE TIPPING POINT and liked it, I decided to give this a try. It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come ""out of the blue"". Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.",2009-05-19,Estados Unidos
2952,1,"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",2009-01-11,Estados Unidos

The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist.

But they don’t. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.” which I find extremely powerful.

He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion.

2994,1,"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",2017-09-25,Estados Unidos
2995,1,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful.... I really enjoyed the diverse fields and examples from which Gladwell draws to make his points. I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York). Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds. Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct. Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis. A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",2014-01-14,Estados Unidos

The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",2009-05-01,Estados Unidos

3031,1,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer. You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories. But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""? The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point. Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past. You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"". Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech. And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous. Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success. Surely the successful need to ""share their success"". Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals). This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",2013-02-28,Estados Unidos

I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read. Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of ""pop-science"" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book.

The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in the roots or causes of success. Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact."" Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing. According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot.

For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things.

3061,1,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement.

Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc?

3078,1,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",2011-07-24,Estados Unidos

Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful.

3087,1,"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening. I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging. He was right. Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance. In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary. Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts. Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control. These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",2011-09-05,Estados Unidos

Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., ""Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway."" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field.

These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",2015-01-21,Estados Unidos

I read all of his books :)",2015-05-26,Estados Unidos
3167,1,"I can't take the full credit for my success.... The above statement is one of the life changing take-aways I have from the book. Gladwell, uses a perfectly selected group of examples to explain the unique, and yet similar circumstances that it took for the Outliers to succeed. However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.",2013-10-27,Estados Unidos
3168,1,Fantastically interesting and compelling book. I originally purchased the audible version of this book but I found it so compelling that I purchased a hard copy as well. It's easy to read and relevant to anyone. I would recommend this to anyone.,2018-12-18,Estados Unidos

3170,1,"Enjoyable, Thought-provoking. My favorite of the Gladwell triumvirate.. Outliers is more observation than advice; as it should be, considering the case it's making. It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked. Similar to Tipping Point and Blink, Gladwell offers memorable anecdotes - himself obviously a student of his own ""sticky"" storytelling as defined in Tipping Point - packaging complex subject matter in distilled, memorable format for those of us making a living on something other than University Stipend.",2010-06-05,Estados Unidos
3171,1,"Love Gladwell's Point-of-View!. Malcolm Gladwell's observations and social epiphanies are thought-provoking and applicable. His style of writing is exciting, and the fluidity makes all of books and articles such fast reads! I have been a fan of Gladwell since I read Blink in high school, and he hasn't lost his charisma with this one. Reading Outliers is inspirational for those who questioned success and ever doubted their ""luck"" in finding success. Otherwise, the book puts so many events and facts into new perspectives.",2013-11-04,Estados Unidos
3172,1,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",2012-02-22,Estados Unidos
3173,1,"One of Best. I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",2010-05-25,Estados Unidos
3174,1,Change How You View Success. This book questions the common belief that success is entirely individual. Anyone who has wondered what makes a person successful or has felt intimidated by the seemingly self-made nature of outliers would enjoy this book.,2011-04-16,Estados Unidos
3175,1,"Outliers by Gladwell. This book sparked a very interesting discussion with a book group about the concept of an outlier. While Gladwell's information was interesting, it seemed to most of us to represent fairly common sense. However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it. Gladwell's book seemed narrow with respect to being almost exclusively American in nature and ignored so many that were in other places in the world and other times in history.",2009-05-19,Estados Unidos

3178,1,Highly recommended. I very much enjoyed this book. For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line. This book however brought home to me how much other unique (unique to them and their time) factors contributed greatly to their success. The stories about hockey players and how the slight difference in age gives the slightly older boy tremendous advantage were particularly enlightening.,2014-04-15,Estados Unidos
3179,1,"If you don't know what success ""is"", you cannot prepare for it. Having read all of Gladwell's popular titles I see the continuation of his endless quest for the answer to ""why"". The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited. Overall, the text makes sense and adds another conversation point for social gatherings or filling time before a meeting.",2009-01-15,Estados Unidos
3180,1,"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",2012-03-23,Estados Unidos

3183,1,"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2012-08-04,Estados Unidos
3184,1,"Outliers is Outstanding!. In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary. He proposes that 10,000 hours of practice make us outstanding; that's why The Beatles -who played on stage in Hamburg for 270 days, 8 hours a day make their special sound, or why the Hockey players born in january-febraury had more chances of make it to NHL (because they are closer to start date).

3196,1,Excellent Book!. This book is very well written. Gladwell helps one to understand that there is more to success than just hard work and ability; it has a lot to do with being in the right time and place.

3200,1,"Interesting Facts. The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful. In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",2009-06-27,Estados Unidos
3201,0,"Speaking of outliers.... What is it about Malcolm Gladwell's little 8.5""x5.5"" books that I find so annoying? Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",2009-05-26,Estados Unidos

Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately. I agree with the premise of the book to a point. While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors. By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",2017-01-13,Estados Unidos

3246,1,Readability. Quite enjoyable read,2020-01-13,Estados Unidos
3247,1,Interesting Nonfiction. The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life. It reads almost like a fiction book. The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened. He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,2013-05-20,Estados Unidos
3248,1,"First-rank work by Gladwell again. This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress. Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book. Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.) There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground. Easily one of the most important books of the last 10 years, imho.",2009-01-19,Estados Unidos
3249,1,"Outstanding Outliers. This is equal to Gladwell's Tipping Point and better than Blink. It contains fabulous, specific examples of how brilliance is often a factor of early opportunities available to some and not others, from hockey stars to Bill Gates. The book slows toward the end, it seems as if there is filler to make it long enough for hard cover, and I can also make a case that the brilliance is in taking advantage of the opportunities that others ignore or don't appreciate. But it's a provocative, fine read.",2009-02-12,Estados Unidos

It is a great book if you have young children and want to help set them up for future success (my opinion).

I learned a few interesting facts about what outliers are and, perhaps more importantly, some ways to make just about everyone perform at the ""outlier level"". I suppose many of the observations in the book could be considered common sense. But until someone like this author points out what's happening that common sense is never engaged.

Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion. By backing it up with analysis and multiple cases, creditability results. There is a strong enough case established to make his views worth reading and thinking about.",2014-11-08,Estados Unidos
3273,1,"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously. It is well written and very thought provoking. Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society. Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion. My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success. The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook. Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely. This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions). Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W.

While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",2015-06-29,Estados Unidos

He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate. He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking.

3337,1,"Many undercurrents influence & direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro & micro levels.... This book was required reading for my high schooler this past Summer Break (but I got to it first). Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here. The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting. Convincing, great food for thought. The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time. I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages. (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.) For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research. This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education. The insights this book will provide them should serve them for a lifetime. The insights I gained, some of which were hypotheses previously, will serve to provide more understanding of what possibly may be going on under and around me during my lifetime.",2017-11-20,Estados Unidos

3340,1,"A Good ""Eye Opener"" but Gladwell Goes to Far. Outliers, like many of Gladwells other books, starts with a rather simply idea and supports it through various stories. In this case the idea that Gladwell promotes is that massive success, such as that achieved by Bill Gates or The Beatles, occurs not primarily from hard work or raw talent but rather from a ""patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” Gladwell weighs luck above all other criteria in any success story.",2016-11-13,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell has taken a remarkably broad approach to try to identify if there any factors in common between 'OUTLIERS' - people whose achievements lie well beyond the normal range. His studies are as diverse as Mozart, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. He looks at football teams and ""geniuses"". His conclusions are unexpected but compelling - lateral thinking which surprises and entertains.

The main premise of the book is that the most successful are not successful only because of hard work, though that is part of it; they also tend to have had great luck in getting experience (or, more specifically, the opportunity to get a lot of practice). The examples he gives are fascinating and I fond quite a bit too highlight. As some of the reviews have said, it makes you think; mainly, obviously to look at success as dependent on circumstances, but also to realize that most people have the potential to be immensely successful, as long as they are in the right place at the right time, regardless of their IQ.",2013-09-12,Estados Unidos

It debunks the convient myth that people we look at as successful or just born with it. That thinking lets some people feel comfortable with not being as successful as they could be. The bottomline is the book shows you why Bill Gates and a few other successful people are in effect successful.

I look forward to enjoying many new aha moments as I read the other books written by Mr. Gladwell. I had selected this book in hopes of discovering some recipe that I might employ to foster the interests of my children. I had hoped to discover the formula for helping to cultivate/ foster their ultimate success. This book did a great deal to inform my thinking.

No, the writer is not presenting original research but Malcolm Gladwell is a genious at taking the research of others and putting it together in new ways that are thought provoking and mind-changing. I read this book very quickly but the ideas presented here about success and how it is attained will stay with me for a long time. It has changed how I look at myself and others.

For example, Gladwell looks at,”Demographic Luck” (a.k.a the effect of one’s birth date). Gladwell shows that your birth date can affect whether or not you make a sports team or become smarter than someone else.

Talent by itself will not get you to where you want to be in life. Hard work by itself will not get you where you want to be in life. Opportunities by themselves will not get you where you want to be in life. But if you combine talent, a good work ethic, opportunities, and being born or growing up at the right time, can lead you to a very successful life.

The real point is, it's inspiring. Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity. Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable. I think it's a good estimate of the truth. I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.

Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful. Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point. He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality. The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",2009-09-27,Estados Unidos

How did Bill Gates become a billionaire? And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes. Gladwell lays down the blueprint for outliers, and gives the story of success.",2013-11-15,Estados Unidos

My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research.

3805,1,"Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review. The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this. I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage, to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific.

The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.

It lets the reader learn the concept of what makes successful people, well, successful. It goes step by step explaining the importance of circumstance and luck (yes, luck!) as key role players in the lives of people who achieve (or don't) the kind of success that we normally attribute to just hard work and ingenuity. It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part. This also helps the reader realize that to become successful there are barriers we have to overcome beyond our own personal shortcomings, that we have to work to overcome invisible barriers imposed on us by years and centuries of traditions and culture.",2012-07-13,Estados Unidos

His revelations about human behavior are always interesting, make sense and are surprising, nonetheless. He thinks outside of the box. Every parent and teacher should read ""Outliers"" for insight into what goes into success and how little things can help or hinder all of us.

In the ending, when the author chooses to use his own family history to illustrate the point he makes throughout the book, there are some shocking passages on racism, it really makes us realize how far we've come and how much is still to be accomplished.

So just when I was sure Blink was the most thought provoking book I'd read since Walker Percy's Lost In The Cosmos, along comes Malcolm Gladwell with Outliers. The subtitle, ""The Story of Success"" is a little off-putting because this book is actually MORE than it promises. These aren't just stories of success: the careful reader will find his own pathway to success. Gladwell doesn't promise as much. His publisher probably won't let him.

Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses. But this book was different. Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times. It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help. Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family. I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had. It was all there. The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.

4075,1,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",2011-04-21,Estados Unidos

4081,1,"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",2010-06-21,Estados Unidos

The 10,000 hour rule that was mentioned was very profound and devastating. I am a professional in the medical field, and after reading this book I no longer feel that it's ethical for me to continue practicing.

4103,1,"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected. You can also see the influences of his family in his life. His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician. Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha). Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success. Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",2015-03-08,Estados Unidos
4104,1,"Great read!. This book should produce some degree of thankfulness in those who read it. In the words of Paul, ""What do we have that we have not received?""

4108,1,"An Outliers' Tipping Point. Why this book matters: I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers. When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell. Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience. Many books are a great read. How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come? To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance. Well written book, well researched, and inspiring others to greatness. Don't blink Malcolm, you have created a tipping point.",2009-08-13,Estados Unidos
4109,1,What Separates Us from Most. This book was fascinating. Outliers helps us to understand that we have been shaped by circumstances beyond our control.

But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",2010-04-29,Estados Unidos

The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly. Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me.

Gladwell's study indicates that the intelligence factor plays far less a role than many other factors such as time spent on a skill, education, and one's cultural environment. his work is going to have a tremendous effect on the education of children. it will also lead many parents to place more emphasis on intervening in their children's development, especially in having them learn special skills at an early age. we know that tiger woods began playing golf as a toddler. parents will begin taking this concept more seriously than before. black parents will also begin to understand the relationship of culture to their worldview and resultant behavior, especially what they are teaching their children on a subliminal level. it is very critical reading for those of us who live in the black communities of america. this book will spawn tremendous activity and research.many more books will be written because of it.",2010-03-10,Estados Unidos

4514,1,Success awaits. Can't wait to dive into this one!,2017-02-26,Estados Unidos
4515,1,"For Entrepreneurs. I’m a student at University of Baltimore and I am in enrolled in an Entrepreneurship course. To summarize the book, Outliers takes you through a serious of account and stories to explain how successful people become successful. The first part of the book explains that successful people are successful because of the opportunities they are granted. This allows them to be able to hone their craft, or depending on the era they were born, gives them a chance to capitalize in certain situations. The second part of the book talks about legacy and how depending on your culture, shapes the person you’ll become. What I love about this book, is how it explains how to become successful through the use of inspiring accounts from the lives of people who just like me had or have an ordinary life. In most cases, it’s hard to explain and gives steps on how to be successful because many believe it’s based on luck. However, Gladwell proves that success is almost calculated and mapped out based on the time of several attributes such as your cultural background or opportunities. However, some of his accounts like basing the hockey player’s age as the reason as to why most are successful is farfetched in my opinion. For entrepreneur students, it teaches them to dismiss the fact that being successful is just luck or a random occurrence. Entrepreneur students reading this book learn that success is all based on how you position yourself and the opportunities you decide to take.",2015-03-04,Estados Unidos

4527,1,Language matters. An amazing read! One of my favorite parts is how language of a particular culture can make or break performance at high risk/stress work enviroments.

And how the levels of crushes reduced dramatically once the airlines adopted English language to streamline communication between a pilot and crew.,2014-09-26,Estados Unidos

4786,0,"The Myth of Productivity. Gladwell points out some very important factors to increase productivity as a laborer and to be more competitive in an economy that favors employers: Education, Hard Work, Funding, Connections and a little luck. These are especially important in a declining economy, but their importance is attenuated in a growing economy. As demand for laborers exceeds the labor supply, opportunity is created for everyone, not just the most productive and competitive. This is the fundamental point that Gladwell does not understand. He never asks the important questions: What is causing the demand for labor to decrease? What is causing a reduction in the supply of jobs? What is causing economic decline? Why don't we change what is causing demand for labor to decrease instead of increasing the labor supply? And this is my ""genuine misgiving"" with Gladwell's ""glorious misconception."" Still, the reality is that the economy is in decline and laborers will have to become more competitive in order to gain the diminishing number of jobs available in the market. I think Gladwell does a good job providing psycho-analytical reasons for accepting and persisting in the grind of life as it becomes more grueling and for accepting failure as the result of bad luck. More capital consumption in order to grow and make more competitive the labor supply is not a long term solution. Increasing the labor pool does not equate to increasing the job pool. It is not opportunity in real terms.",2013-07-16,Estados Unidos

But the overall impression one gets after reading the book is that it is a long argument for the value of hard work in certain limited fields. Yes, Gladwell does say that his ""outliers"" like Bill Gates and Bill Joy had extraordinary opportunities and luck that other people didn't have; but none of that opportunity and luck would have done them any good if they hadn't been willing to work very long hours at programming, in order to become the best programmers in the world.

There are people that can learn a new language (Lithuanian) in a couple of weeks (not 10,000 hours - Think Daniel Tammet). What annoys me is that some people now quote that FALSE STATEMENT as though it were gospel. It's NOT! Oh well, there are also other major errors in Gladwells books, but he IS entertaining. And it wouldn't hurt if he lost that ""absent minded professor"" look! He could tuck his shirt in (or leave it out). Not half-in half-out...before a giving a talk at TED.

5423,1,"Yes, Society is Screwing You; Find Out Just How Bad It Is. This was an utterly fascinating book about the secret factors that contribute to individual success. We are told to be smart, savvy and take advantage of opportunities, but factors like what time of year you're born, what decade you're born in, the circumstances of your education, and other factors beyond our control have a great deal to do with how successful we can become. This will amaze you, and if you're thinking about it, you'll get mad at how your circumstances determine who you can become. After a certain point you'll read this book for pointers on how to screw the system that is screwing you. The discouraging thing is that virtually no one makes it who has not worked hard and done their homework, but most people will be stopped hard by factors they can do nothing about. I have read several Malcolm Gladwell books and have been consistently pleased by the numerous examples and behind-the-scenes exposes that he consistently highlights. You have long suspected that society is a rigged game, but the extent to which society is jerking you around must be seen to be believed. An enlightening, maddening book that should be required reading for every high school student.",2016-01-17,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell is a master storyteller who weaves an astonishing tapestry from case examples in sports, technology, manufacturing, education, and other arenas to support his premise. Outliers is fascinating as a sociological map of those we might consider geniuses, but we learn that the true geniuses may be still on the farm, because their circumstances never provided the fertile soil of life situations to propel them to their full potential. Likewise, there are those whose heritage interfered and set the stage for tragedy. Most striking is that you only need to be smart enough, not a genius, to excel.

The PC revolution was not his doing solely, and it was probably planned. His family has been in Eugenics. His foundation disguises their real goal by putting on the face of philanthropy.

I thought there was no way it could be bad, but lo and behold, I was disappointed and bewildered by the time I got to the end of the last CD. Dumbfounded, really. It is boring, tedious, explains nothing, and gives you an overabundance of details in fields that you probably have no interest in. The main thing is that the author never quite explains the meaning, reason or route to success. The author give you the feeling that there is no rhyme or reason for anything, that it is all chance.

6271,0,"Gladwell is over-rated. After reading all three of Gladwell's books (Tipping Point, Blink, and Outlier), I have pretty much figured out his formula. Glackwell is half black as well as a Canadian. Basically, he writes about things that would normally be politically incorrect for a white person to write about. For example, according to Gladwell, Asians are good at math because they come from a culture of growing rice. He does this from behind the ""shield"" of being half black, so of course he can't possibly be implying anything racist or ethnocentric. In addition, Gladwell has a very obvious ideology that he is espousing - essentially that of a political liberal who believes that the individual is less important than the culture he comes from or the lucky advantages the individual enjoys. In other words, the important thing is the collective.",2009-01-12,Estados Unidos

However, things like family background and socio-economic status really do matter. Even plain old luck, such as where and when you were born, can make a huge difference. Measured IQ may afford an advantage, but only to a point.

Yet just as I was delighted with that work, I was equally disappointed with ""Outliers."" His findings stated the obvious. Parental support combined with opportunity/chance provides the landscape for amazing success stories. Are these outliers or merely the results of strong parental support? Certainly culture, environment, and other variables combined play a role in success. It would seem that the true outliers would be those that came from lower income families. These families were concerned with economic survival that no time was available to support the educational needs of their children. When children from this background and despite the odds achieved success, they would truly be the outliers.

The context is a Bronx school program called KIPP and inner city disadvantaged kids. The disadvantage being, middle class parents building up their kids during the summer break while poor kids just languish over the summer doing nothing. He upset me when he said, ""It is not the brightest who succeed, If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is rather, a gift."" Got that folks, we are not in charge of our own destiny. You didn't build any thing you think you worked hard for. I just lost total respect for this mans writing abilities, which I might add, he's just lucky he has.

6423,0,"McSuccess. This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists. However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful. I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations. After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A. Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause. Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era. Duhhhh. What makes his ""research"" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation. For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable. In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion? Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.",2009-10-26,Estados Unidos

Hard work, preserverence, determination, commitment and resilience are qualities that this book does not celebrate. Instead, it focuses on culture, upbringing, date of birth and chance. If you are looking for self improvement, I would highly recommend skipping this title and reading books like “The secret of the ages” by Robert Collier, “The power of your subconscious mind” by dr Joseph Murphy, “The richest man in Babylon” by George S. Clason etc.",2019-02-15,
6467,1,"Engaging, but overrated. Outliers has many interesting statistical anecdotes sprinkled throughout, to be sure. My interest was held. But at its core, the book's central theme is simply ""successful people are aided in their success by their families, culture, education and other chance factors. They could not have done it alone."" This is not exactly a particularly profound revelation. Gladwell repeatedly asserts that most people think Bill Gates-type successes are simply due to that person's raw talent and little else. But is that really the case? Does anybody really think Bill Gates could have achieved what he did had he been born in Botswana, for example? What's more, while crediting these outside factors with making these ""outliers"" possible, he fails to note that in almost every case, hundreds if not thousands or even more other people had virtually identical birth situations, yet failed to achieve greatness. Gladwell's goal seems to be an attempt to take the shine off of society's great success stories by, in effect, claiming they just got lucky. But I think the formula for producing an outlier is more complex than that. Too often in this book, Gladwell seems to be profoundly stating the obvious.",2008-12-13,
6468,1,"Captivating (if not an outlier). Regardless of what you ultimately think of the author's analysis, Gladwell is a masterful storyteller, weaving together interesting anecdotes from such diverse sources as plane crash research to hillbilly feuds to standardized math tests. That Gladwell narrates the audio book himself adds greatly to the listening experience. Critics will complain that his thesis is obvious (that opportunity, cultural inheritence and hard work play key roles in success), or that his examples are selective and ignore in turn outliers that don't illustrate his points -- or, somewhat inconsistently, both. But Gladwell's books are successful because he examines phenomena and topics of importance in an accessible and entertaining way. No one should mistake Malcolm Gladwell for a big thinker like, say, Stephen J. Gould, but Gladwell would be the first one to tell you that he's no outlier. Don't accept everything the author says as truth revealed, but do listen to this book -- it's one of the best non-fiction offerings available through Audible.",2008-11-21,

He uses various examples of elite success and attributes the outcome to competative or situational advantages. He however dismisses the fact that in every example both advantage and personal perserverance, hard work and above average work ethic are clearly present.

Gladwell is a fine writer and this book, in the same style as Blink, explores the real factors that contribute to the success of those we think are so above and beyond us (Bill Gates, the Beatles, etc.). Gladwell makes it clear that their talent, drive, energy, and intelligence WERE key to their success but that these, alone, would not have done it for them. They needed unusual opportunities. In fact, the opportunities given them that were not given others were as important to their achievements as their personal qualities. This book helps reduce the ""superstars"" down to human level. If you had been given the opportunities these were, you might have achieved what they did or more!",2009-03-08,

We often think that outliers (those special, exceptional people) are disciplined, self-made successful people. That is not the case. It is the environment, support system, and other factors that can make an ordinary person into an extraordinary person. I recommend skipping chapters 6 and 7 about family feuds in the Appalachian and South Korean airplane crashes and coming back to at the end. Those chapters demonstrate how culture can be a detriment to a person's success.",2020-04-19,

The book is written in an organized way yet displays profound out the box thinking. Many of us like to think of our heros as truely exceptional people but Mr. Gladwell shows us in his book that many times it's taking what's been given to us, practicing, and being in the right place at the right time. I enjoyed the entire book but what most impressed me was his personal tale about himself, his mother, and grandmother and how being an Outlier has more to do with what went before us then what we actually were able to do ourselves. I liked how the book made me think about how even if I wasn't an Outlier that by me providing opportunities as a teacher or a parent that I may help a future Outlier.",2009-11-09,
6487,1,"Some interesting thoughts to ponder. This is a well-written book that brings up some important things to think about. Gladwell's conclusion that you need to be lucky as well smart and hardworking to be hugely successful is probably true. To get really far out on the bell curve you need for everything to go right, or wrong, depending on which side of the curve. Still it is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from extreme outliers, at least when dealing with a standard bell curve. If you are interested in what makes rich people rich read ""The Millionaire Next Door"", it deals with the more applicable part of the curve for most of us. Drawing conclusions from relatively few data points is always risky but Gladwell shows clearly the a small head start can get you far ahead.",2009-06-24,

This book will make us all want to go out and change our educational system, look at what country the pilot of our plane grew up in and marvel that our Scottish ancestors took time out from their violent inclinations to have kids.

I thought the point that success is factored upon opportunity and having the support of influential ppl was obvious. And you don't need a scientific research to figure that out or there is a need to proof it. However, I think he forgot that opportunities can be pursued and not brought to you and that's one major factor of successful ppl.

Malcolm Gladwell doesn't say anything new here except for the fact that every individual needs to work hard and practice makes perfect. The only difference here is the amount of research the author has gathered is remarkable and many of his facts and researches prove a point. The epilogue chapter was completely unrequired.

For example Asian kids being better at math, well they are still better at math even when they are raised in or adopted into another culture or country. Maybe rice farming did make them better at math, but this characteristic goes beyond mere culture because you can remove culture and it still remains. The same goes for much of the other topics in the book.

6510,0,"Not what I expected. So, it seems that people that have success were just in the right moment, raised by the right family and were born at the appropriate time. Even the mother of the author. I can agree in some of the points made by the author; yes, those people were in certain circumstances that they took advantage of and bum! Success was the consequence. So, if you just want to hear the stories of these people and what circumstances surrounded them to be successful then go ahead and buy the book. But, and here is a breaking point, if you want to learn something of these stories to apply it to your own life and maybe also be successful, then that’s another different story, the book won’t provide it to you so easily. You have to interpret it. My interpretation is that you have to be aware of your own “circumstances”, your strengths and your advantages that life provides you, and you have to be able to take advantage of them. That’s it. If you are blind to those advantages or circumstances that you have, then you won’t catch them and you won’t be successful or don’t as successful as you could be. So open your eyes. Be aware and know what time you are living, and “see” what you have in your favor. I am not sure that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs were aware or what they have in their hands and they consciously took advantage at that time…maybe after 30 years they were able to see it, but well, that’s another discussion.",2019-11-28,

6525,1,"Disappointed. Throughout the book, the author uses narratives of several famous Individuals to generalize to the population. In effect, he attempts to validate his perspective with scattered anecdotal evidence. I found this somewhat misrepresentative during the progression of the book and then it all made sense listening to the interview at the end. The author purposefully planned the book as an ""assault on rugged individualism""--his description. He appears to do this to advance some sociopolitical perspective (again, listen to the interview). Sure, circumstances and opportunity play a role in all our lives, not only the rich or famous. The hockey team story is way overblown. Could 6 more months of physical and emotional maturity make a difference in adolescent athletes? Sure, but are not most sophomore athletes better than their freshman year? Yes, it is simply development, practice, and competitive play. That some are denied opportunity because of these factors and it is unfair is nonsense. The author also seems to discount all the other intra-individual characteristics that could be significant factors in the courses of these lives and the outcomes of the stories. If you have ever made something out of nothing by virtue of your determination, had insights and developed some innovative project, or creatively solved a dilemma, you may not like this book. According to the author's perspective, you just got lucky and then anyone could have done the rest. He magnifies one factor in the equation disproportionally and minimizes the other contributors. I enjoyed Blink, but he's off target here. These are interesting stories, which is why I suspect so many people rate the book so highly. Anecdotes do not equal evidence.",2014-11-07,

This book came highly recommended from a few friends and coworkers as a thought-provoking and almost groundbreaking book about what makes the outliers of society so successful.

When you stop and think about how someone like Bill Gates became so successful, you know that he had to have everything in his life line up. There are thousands of cases of people who are very smart but just don't have the opportunity to succeed and become extremely wealthy. While Gladwell does bring up some good examples to support his main thesis, he often over simplifies things with statements like in order to become a great hockey player you have to be born in January. The reasoning makes sense, but it throws out any other variable that may come into play and it seems like he almost wants to discredit an individual's drive and natural ability.",2013-01-30,

But I enjoy reading opinions and research and that is exactly what Gladwell combined here.

Gladwell's message--that success is more about nurture than nature; along with importance of being in the right place at the right time--these are not new conclusions.

The author is a master at taking a series of observations and making a circumstantial case for a point, but then never critically assessing whether his assertions are correct by looking at them in some objective manner. The hypothesis is that there are random but predictable factors control our fate. So here is the problem. It is easy to look retrospectively and say, Bill gates is who he is because someone bought a computer for his 8th grade class which gave him a unique opportunity. So if that purchase was the key for bill, what happened to all his classmates and why don't we know anything about them. Another hypothesis is that its really the extent to which you practise that determines your outcome, so really successful musicians are there because they practiced more over the years. Umm, but what led them to practise so much more at an early age? The author acts like he has solved the nature vs. nurture; argument, but it is not so simple. Then ther is the statements that once you reach a certain basic level of height for basketball players or intelligence for the rest of us, that additional height or intelligence does not matter. Umm, why do BB players get measured to the millimeter at pre-NBA draft camps, and why does their stock fall if a player is found to only be 6-6, instead of 6-8, and why are there so many slow relatively clumsy 7-0 white guys sitting on rosters if height above 6-2 does not matter.",2009-09-10,

He uses examples varying from teenage hockey players in Canada and teenage soccer players from Europe to Bill Gates and Bill Joy.

True Bill Gates had a great advantage that he had an open computer terminal at the age of 13 Gladwell presents the story as if he and his colleagues were the only ones on the face of the planet with such an opportunity. It’s just not true he tells half a story in order to make a point that can’t be really supported any other way. That’s only one example of the mini holes in his ideas.

I'm sure I'm the only one but just in case I'm not, maybe skip it or listen to that chapter with caution.",2022-03-14,
6600,1,"90% there.. Great book. This book is a like eating a great steak and then the last bite has a bad crunch. Gratitude is where I believe he was going, instead the final chapter/interview seem to shift from gratitude into “you didn’t accomplish this, you did because someone else”. It seems to miss the hard work requirement of the individual and that individuals made every single choice. Maybe he covers that in other books. Still would recommend the book, gratitude is what I am taking away from the read.",2022-03-10,
6601,1,Excellent!. one of my all time favorite books - bonus points for the author's voice and cadence.,2022-03-08,
6602,1,"Amazing read. Enjoyed listening to Malcolm’s thought process of how the “talented” and those who are revered for their skills are products of time , cultural legacy, opportunity or even the time they were born. It’s such a unique way of looking through the lens of the author and which feels so true given not everyone gets to grow under the same circumstances or situations.",2022-03-07,
6603,1,Amazing!. Great book and recording. I also enjoyed the interview at the end. It is well worth it.,2022-03-03,
6604,1,"Gotta love when authors narrate their own work.. Gladwell is one of those authors who I was skeptical of, thinking that he was perhaps a bit built up and unworthy of the adoration he receives. However, his work lives up to the hype, and this is well worth the read.",2022-02-28,
6605,1,Insightful.. This certainly gave me a different perspective of my life. It was a great read.,2022-02-24,
6606,1,great listen. This book layed a new perspective to what being successful means. It had great examples and the data he collected and reviewed to make his points. It makes this book very interesting.,2022-02-14,

6608,0,Woke Conclusions. I would definitely not recommend this book. The conclusions he draws are a stretch. It seems to me that the point of this book is to convince Us all that there’s no such thing as an outlier. There’s just a bunch of lucky people who are successful. What a silly hypothesis.,2022-02-13,
6609,1,"Absolutely my favorite book of all time!!!. The first time reading this book was 10 years ago when I picked up a book from Barnes and Nobel on my way to catch a flight.  At the time, I was not much of an avid reader, nor have I ever finished an entire book in one sitting. Before I knew my flight was over, I had finished the book in entirety.",2022-02-10,

6611,1,"Gets better. Least favorite Malcolm Gladwell book so far, but still great. Much of it just seems too obvious. It does improve the further along it goes however. As the examples become more complex the book becomes much more compelling.",2022-02-01,

6617,1,It was “eh”. I could sum up this book with “work hard and put a lot of time in and hope luck is on your side”. It’s not a great listen. I’ve heard it’s a better read but I honestly don’t think I would’ve made it through had I tried to read it. I knew it was gonna be rough when the opening of the book starts with a 20 minute diatribe on hockey players birthdays.,2022-01-13,

6622,1,"very interesting. A look behind the curtain of what helps to make some of the most successful people successful. This is not a book that tells you how to become successful, but instead looks at the reasons people became successful. some very interesting theories",2021-12-31,

6624,0,"Biased. If you know how easily statistics and be manipulated, then you’ll see right through this book. One sided approach to his stats and opinions from sports (sorry Mr. Gladwell, but hockey has periods, not quarters) to his reviews in college academics. Some may be true or have a correlation but the easiest way I can explain the bias is just because it correlates doesn’t mean it causes it.",2021-12-21,

6626,1,"Thoughts from a pure grinder. I am a hard worker and that has gotten me a lot of success. I will say that I am afforded a lot of privileges which contribute to me little success. I can respect that and will continue to take advantage of any opportunity I can. I just really really hope that people realize that we all have different areas of advantage and it those who find them, work on them and make something of them self on these “talents” “opportunities” or luck that find success. There are a lot of ppl who will read this book and think to themselves I am not afforded any privileges by any means, therefore I can not have the success of bill gates or Ben franklin. That is not what this book is trying to do and I wish that Mr. Gladwell would have pointed that out. Work hard at what comes easiest to you or what makes most sense to you. That is how one finds there own unique genius.",2021-12-18,
6627,1,"Finally, a case well made.... I have intuitively understood that there are many influences of success, but have never heard it explained so well and completely. I enjoyed the different stories and the similarities they share, explained masterfully. Well done Malcolm!",2021-12-16,
6628,1,My intellect is fed. Thank you Malcolm for publishing something that provides insight to a view which may have previously been assumed. I enjoyed listening to your book more specific I enjoyed listening to it from your voice. I hope that others have the same experience that I did.,2021-12-13,
6629,1,incredible analysis of his data. Malcolm Gladwel tells some very impressive stories. the stories reflect his attitude about the americas. his stories make an attempt to negate the value of rugged individualism which is a mainstay of america. I totally enjoyed the book and continue to study it today because it allows me to juxtapose my views on data that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. I highly recommend reading and listening to this book.,2021-12-11,

6637,1,Great book. As a student of human behavior I have found no writer more interesting than Malcom Gladwell. Concepts of people and events that I thought I had a pretty firm grasp on are much more complex than I may have imagined. I appreciate the mind of this author and his ability to dig in to the complexities of the human condition to paint a more complex and I believe accurate picture. I’ve now read 5 books by this man and will read everything this man ever writes.,2021-11-07,
6638,1,Surprisingly good!. I was assigned to read this book as part of a leadership program. Some of the books were pretty dry and I started this book with that mindset that it was just another dry read. Once I got into the book I found it to actually be very interesting and kept my attention. After reading it I began to recognize situations and incidences in my own life that were applicable to the book's content. Worth the read.,2021-10-25,

It's a struggle to listen through his overgeneralized narrative on the statistical data. the facts the writer puts together is amazing to know, but the way he puts it is so unbearable to listen through. I hope he could clarify/ assure from time to time that he 'doesn't mean that everybody born/doesn't possess the outlying traits that he described are bound to be doomed, but just statistically less advantaged.' Please do not takes his word literal and do process if u are looking for life advice. I hope all readers knows better and are not misled after listening to the heavily biased topics, that daytoday reality does not operates statistically.

The book breaks down cultural, historical, personal and environmental factors that help shape some of the most successful people in our world today. Each chapter offers different backgrounds of “Outliers” in history. Definitely is an interesting point of view.

It provides important details around the circumstances of the ultra successful and how they got there. It’s premise, I will admit that I have agreed with but often overlook, that no one gets far without help and support from others. The part that was eye opening for me, was how much the right timing of birth plays in being afforded opportunities that are life and even world changing.",2021-06-22,

6691,1,"Better the second time. I had read this book years ago closer to when it was published and at the time my takeaway was about hard work and the ten thousand hours rule. Re reading this book now as a DEI consultant and coach, I am amazed at the depths that Gladwell goes to in describing and making the case for privilege, exploring the validity of cultural legacy and the necessity for acknowledging culture. Gladwell's very candid approach to describing society's collective agency on creating a society that allows for more people to succeed is right on time for 2021. Refreshing take.

6714,1,"Te abre la cabeza. Las personas somos seres de hábito, y este libro desenvuelve aquellos mecanismos inconscientes que todos tenemos y nos hace más conscientes de cómo y porqué los exitosos llegan a donde están. Realmente lo encuentro útil más allá de entretenido",2021-04-09,
6715,1,"Engaging all the way through. Excellent reading, well written, and kept me coming back all the way through. can't recommend enough.",2021-04-08,
6716,1,"Insightful.. Outliers includes a detailed analysis of environmental factors (culture, year, upbringing, etc) that helps to explain the exceptionalism of several individuals in different contexts (hockey, law, computer programming, etc). The book, in some sense, is a critique of rugged individualism and it is definitely convincing and strong in its argument. The audio book is an easy listen and short. The book is easy to digest.",2021-04-06,
6717,1,"Very interesting.. This was a well written, well performed book. I thoroughly enjoyed it as my first introduction to Malcolm Gladwell's works. I look forward to reading more from him.",2021-04-06,

6721,1,"A must read for all. I think this should be a must read for everyone. It shows that people in our society who have great success or opportunity are no different than most individuals. Gladwell really puts things in perspective and I would hope this book would make people look at individuals with success, money, and fame differently.",2021-04-03,
6722,1,Loved it. Great inspiration to think deeper about the world we live in and the circumstances that shape it.,2021-04-02,

6725,1,what creates success. very interesting study on what creates and allows some people to become fantastically successful,2021-03-29,
6726,1,It helped me to look at the world differently. I love it when an author writes in such a way that it helps me see the world from another perspective. This book is a great example of that. It has me reflecting on how I'm raising my own 5 kids and what I can do differently. I'm also looking at how I'm going about my own career and I'm seeing why I've had success and wondering if there were other reasons and if I can create new success,2021-03-28,
6727,1,"Gladwell always delivers a unique take. I’ve listened to or read most of his books and they all strike at something that ripples under the surface of reality and guides humanity as a whole or individually. He narrates his own book extremely well. I’ve heard him on a lot of podcasts and he is great speaking in general, but also reads very well.",2021-03-24,
6728,1,"Great Book, Great Story. I am a fan of the Gladwell, but in general, it was an excellent follow through in ideas and content. What is the context of our success. This books executes on that concept perfectly, with insight to help other on their path outside of circumstance. Great read, worth the time and study.",2021-03-23,

6731,0,"Fatalistic. Interesting points, but he takes great pains to disqualify years of work in favor of circumstances and luck. He'd have you think the 70 percent of millionaires who came from humble beginnings are a mere product of their environment. It's folly but entertaining if taken with a grain of salt.",2021-03-20,

6733,1,"good way to understand outliers, engaging stories. It is important to understand outliers if you want to understand the world, because so many dynamics in our world are driven by outliers. This book helps with that and presents the main ideas in engaging stories which I have learned new interesting information from as a sice effect.",2021-03-18,
6734,1,"Amazing Book. Amazing Book everything was clear, I loved it . highly recommend that anyone or everyone should read it",2021-03-17,
6735,1,Addictive!. Great listen. Read very well. I liked it so much I bought the paperback too.,2021-03-16,
6736,1,Gave me a new perspective!. This book was a great study in compilation of various types outliers. Gave me a new perspective on what I do and do not have control over.,2021-03-15,
6737,1,"Success is not an accident. Outliers can be anyone. I picked up this book because it was on my daughter's reading list, but it was an eye-opening read, I suggest that anyone could benefit from reading this book.",2021-03-11,
6738,1,"Classic, Persuasive. In this book Gladwell makes a strong case for what it takes to be successful, and that people we think of as outliers are not really outliers at all.",2021-03-11,
6739,0,Boring and overrated!. Too boring as a book and audiobook.,2021-03-11,
6740,1,"Opportunity meets preparation. Outliers downplays the effort required for sky high success and instead focuses on the luck angle. Although a bit unfair in how lopsided it is, I instead see it as a balance. The self-made-man myth is ubiquitous to the point of being entirely unquestioned in America and is in desperate need of such balance.",2021-03-10,
6741,1,"In its own segment, highly recommend. Enjoyed this immensely and would encourage you to keep a note pad or notes open on your phone, it will be thought provoking and have you thinking about how you may have an advantage you never thought about.",2021-03-04,

6743,1,Outliers. One of the most fabulous books I have ever read/listened to. I cannot recommend this highly enough to everyone. All high schools should have this book on the must read list or students.,2021-03-03,
6744,1,I really enjoyed Outliers. I enjoyed and learned a lot from Outliers. I too am interested in many of the great people mentioned in this book. I question their success not in a negative way but exactly in the way that Malcolm explains. It was nice to learn how just the right amount of occurrences and in a certain order leads to the ultimate outlier. It makes sense and history shows it.,2021-03-01,
6745,1,"It Takes A Village. An excellent listen on the formative potential of the butterfly effect, in my opinion. It opens one up to recognize patterns and sociological support systems everywhere in our cultures, to be aware of one's own potential for positive impact upon oneself and others. Highly recommended.",2021-02-26,
6746,1,"Outstanding Book. A great read, My best part of the book was about the Culture legacy. How did I know connect where a person comes from to how they act. I also learned so much about Rice paddies. Highly recommended it.",2021-02-25,
6747,1,"Ignores some things. When pointing out the luck of being born at certain times, it isn’t mentioned how many others who did not become outliers were also born in that period. So even if the periods were vital, there was still separation from the masses. It also doesn’t take into account that people other than outliers were provided with similar or better opportunities yet still didn’t become outliers.",2021-02-23,
6748,1,Outliers will make you cynical of genius. Rightly so. Malcom Gladwell tries to point to factors that make up success stories that are often overlooked and just attributed to personal genius for eye catching headlines.,2021-02-20,
6749,1,Intriguing. I happened to read Outliers just after reading Atlas Hugged and the common theme of the vital importance of a nuturing community for the success of humanity is a lesson we all need to heed. No one excels without help.,2021-02-20,
6750,1,What's the point?. I couldn't get the point of the whole idea of the book? shall the football players not been born in Jan stop playing just because they born in the wring date. I believe the book could be more of small talks not a book. The only reason I completed this book is to understand what's the author is trying to prove.,2021-02-19,
6751,1,"Another masterpiece by a true Outlier!. Malcolm Gladwell delivers us yet another masterpiece! We are all blessed to have such a profound thinker, researcher, and skilled author in our time.",2021-02-19,

6755,1,An intriguing read. This was a very interesting and thought-provoking book.,2021-02-13,
6756,1,Brings a great perspective of the world. The main idea that outliers are in fact a natural product of the world we live in is life changing. It helps you see the world in a more realistic view.,2021-02-12,
6757,1,"Novel ideas for Western minds. I personally loved it! Being an Asian, I could relate to a lot of metaphors explained in the book which act as recipe to success. Surely a one time read! My favorite chapter was about Aviation and plane crash.",2021-02-10,
6758,1,"enlightened. this blew my mind. contains well thought out, well-researched material that really makes a person consider their socioeconomic and social advantages and constraints, as well as the merits of hard work. don't read if you're committed to the idea you are ""self-made""",2021-02-06,
6759,1,Eye Opener. A real eye oponer on what is really behind success!!  Excellent book. A 100% recommended.,2021-02-05,
6760,1,"A Good Reminder to Have Gratitude. This book was an insight reminder to show gratitude to the many people and circumstances that came before, that provide us with the opportunities we have. Though it does not make much mention of the importance of taking advantage of such opportunities, and the imperative strengths of the individuals who did, I felt that no such emphasis was necessary, and enjoyed the perspective that was presented. Knowing the role that circumstances have in success, it gives us the insight to work to create those circumstances for our posterity and those around us who are found without them.",2021-02-01,
6761,1,you can't stop listening 👂. Honestly I could not stop listening I didn't want to pause it and I don't think you'll want to take a break either it's just that interesting,2021-01-31,
6762,0,One of the hundreds of similar books. Another book is written using the same formula.,2021-01-30,
6763,1,Mind changing. This book is incredible because it truly provokes the thought process and helps define true success and the reality that each of us has the ability to create change. Though your surroundings and chance play a major role it is up to you to exploit the opportunities and take advantage of owning the opportunity. Great read!,2021-01-26,
6764,1,"Interesting facts but there's more to it. Believing everything the author suggests could place a mental barrier to what you can achieve. For example, if you were born without the previliges of outliers you might have all the excuses for not trying hard",2021-01-24,
6765,1,Thumbs Up. Fascinating perspective that prompts a lot of thought. I suggest this book to all.,2021-01-23,
6766,1,Fantastic. I love the insight this book brings to light. Very impactul and shows a different perspective not typically thought of,2021-01-20,
6767,1,Great but weird too. Very interesting but also filled with weird correlations that don’t pass the statistics test.,2021-01-20,
6768,1,Great Book. wonderful book with true inspiration and insight of success.,2021-01-17,
6769,1,Valuable Knowledge. I used this audiobook when I was reading with the actual book in my hands. I love to read and listen at the same time. I hope the audiobooks would be more affordable.,2021-01-17,
6770,1,very interesting and easy listening. written and read in a way that even the statistics were easy to absorb and understand. very great insight and I like the message/conclusion a lot,2021-01-16,
6771,1,New favorite book. This is my new favorite book of all time. Such a beautiful way of describing how events lead to unimaginable outcomes.,2021-01-13,

6773,1,"The most eye opening thing I've read to date. I cannot think of a book more revealing or interesting than this one. Reading this inspired and baffled me. I found myself gasping numerous times at truths I couldn't believe, but were so obviously staring me in the face my whole life! I cannot say enough good things about it. I'm revitalized and ready to level up my business through what I know now must reach at least 10,000 hours of practice and some seriously good luck. Read this book. I guarantee you won't regret it. 👌🏼",2021-01-09,

6777,1,"Great book, worth listening more than once.. It was a great book to listen to. it's the second book I listen from Gladwell and he's not only a great author, but is also engaging when he narrates. I'm definitely listening again because of all the content let you thinking not only about success and successful people but also about your own circumstances and how have they affect or will influence the course of your life.",2021-01-09,
6778,1,"Amazing. This book was an inspiration for me, and was both a joy and blessing to listen to.",2021-01-05,
6779,1,First M.G book. I enjoyed listening to this book. Drawing on themes that the “self made man” is a collection of generational opportunities is a very interesting concept. Especially when he draws the correlation to his personal family experience.,2021-01-05,

6782,1,"Factors which contribute to success other than hard work and talent !. I always knew that the contributors of success apart from hard work and talent were circumstances, situations, opportunities, your social environment, parents, friends, culture etc. but I did not realize the impact that these factors had on one’s success until I read this book !",2021-01-03,
6783,1,A Think Piece. love love LOVE Malcolm Gladwell,2021-01-02,
6784,1,A new take on success!. I loved the authors dissection of the essential components of success. It doesn’t take genius!  The most successful of us had breaks that were the foundation of their success. The author challenges us as a culture to reproduce those breaks for everyone! And gives examples of those that are making that vision come true!,2021-01-02,
6785,1,Interesting story but should’ve left the narration to the pros. Interesting story but should’ve left the narration to the pros.. Gladwell almost manages to ruin a good story with his flat narration.,2020-12-31,

6788,1,"Circumstance is Critical!. Brilliant book that recognizes that intelligence, talent and desire are critical but circumstance determines incredible success as much as anything!",2020-12-23,
6789,1,"the first half was riveting.. I enjoyed the first half of the book. The facts and figures made sense and were pertinent and relevant. the second half was more describing cultures and why some generate more successful people than others. not certain that I agree with all of the conclusions, but the book overall is entertaining and was worth the purchase.",2020-12-21,
6790,1,"Loved it. I loved everything about this book. The content, the way it was delivered, just everything.

6791,1,"Gets you thinking!. Just finished #Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell! It was great! I do want to mention why.. I was really intrigued by the multiple analogies and parables used in so many famous and ordinary people's lives. Ranging from Bill Gates and Bill Joy to geniuses like Einstein and autodidacts like Chris Langs. To pilots to rice Farmers to Jamaicans to the people in The Deep South and finally people like me who are just very lucky. I loved how he was able to encompass all of our strengths and weaknesses to help us realize how the outliers are created in our world and how we can become or already are, our own outlier! Definitely a book that makes you go...huh 🤔❤️",2020-12-15,
6792,1,A must read. Like all of his books he makes you question the way you think and act.,2020-12-13,
6793,1,"A voice to put you to sleep. Like always with Gladwell, very interesting material. But someone else should read the book. I could drink an entire pot of coffee and his narration would still send me off to dreamy dreamworld.",2020-12-07,
6794,1,"Another Classic. Malcolm Gladwell delivers another information packed, thought provoking book. He explains outliers and in great detail shows you their place in history.",2020-12-06,

6796,1,"GREAT WAT TO STAY GROUDED. I come from a place where only a few thrive and when you do, people think that person was self made. I love how this book shines light on all the opportunities individuals have in their life which allow them to succeed that are often overlooked.",2020-12-03,
6797,1,Amazing book. I really enjoyed this book. The stories are told in a way that engaged me and made me want to hear more. I have referenced some of the examples of outliers he discusses in regular conversation which is always followed up with “how do you know this”?,2020-12-02,

6801,1,"Very dragging. The narrator and the way this book is written was a bit dragging for me from the very start, but after a certain point (not THAT far into the book) everything just got so repetitive. Yes, concrete examples are nice, but that’s basically all of it. He makes his point that outstanding people had certain uncontrollable advantages with regard to timing and general life situation. That point is rephrased again and again and again...",2020-11-27,
6802,1,Amazing book.. One of the best books I have ever read. When I become the King of the world I would make this book mandatory readying for everyone 😊.,2020-11-26,
6803,1,"Life changing for those seeking success in life!. This book changed my life! The most impactful section was about how everyone who is works class has put in 10,000 hours practice and also how there are twin styles of child rearing and I had the lower class neglectful one. This answered long festering insecurities and self criticism about why I wasn’t further ahead at my attempts at entrepreneurship and other efforts to find financial freedom - my environment, family, culture, and resources were not supportive of my goals hardly at all and the falling behind my peers I now see be predictably based on the thesis of this book.",2020-11-25,
6804,1,“Success” Deconstructed. Gladwell deconstructs the notion of “self-made” with each and every example as what we would classify as out of the ordinary. He brings those awe-inspiring traits to a perspective that easily explains how astounding success is shaped by just the right situations and circumstances.,2020-11-24,
6805,1,Practical enlightenment. I love his relatable examples in this book. I think he put to words what most people suspect - success is where hard work meets opportunity.,2020-11-23,

6808,1,Great read! Highly recommend.. I really like the way Malcom Gladwell put things into perspective when it comes to the many ways our generational and cultural upbringing can influence our success. I appreciate the way the book ended on a more personal note which is made me come to understand and respect him that much more. Highly recommend this book.,2020-11-12,

6810,1,Makes up think. Very interesting concepts nice voice to listen to easy to read and hear excellent book,2020-10-28,
6811,1,"Excellent ideas about the origins of success. Gladwell eases us into his thesis thorough a series of rock solid examples. I enjoyed 90% completely, but struggled through the in-depth aviation pilot section. Gladwell needed to stress this to make this point clear about the significant role of culture on our performance and so I'm glad I kept going. The conclusion was powerful and almost cathartic. I already love Revisionist History, but after listening to this book I respect even further Malcolm's ideas and analytical process.",2020-10-23,

6814,1,"Excellent Book. I completely subscribe to the philosophy that there is an element of luck in every successful person’s story. And the flip side, I’ve never subscribed to the notion that we can be anything we want to be. This book provides evidence to support that perspective. This doesn’t mean hard work doesn’t pay off. Of course it does, but the opportunity to work hard does not present itself to all of us. Excellent book, and Gladwell’s delivery of the content was perfect.",2020-10-10,
6815,1,Interesting Analytical Detail of the Successful. The storyline invites the reader to be introspective of ones own life as compared to the analyzed stories. This can be handy for understanding ones self and how to go forward...at least for me.,2020-10-10,
6816,1,"Good but not what I was expecting. *Edit* I would recommend listening to the end interview first. It put the book more into a perspective i wish i had during the book.

6820,1,"You'll be astounded by the relationships uncovered. For many decades, I have been curious why certain people were able to ""make it"" to upper stratosphere of accomplishment. My own world has shown that 10,000 hours of mastery helps elevate your position, but this helps you understand that mastery alone isn't enough. However, it still leaves room for understanding so that perhaps you can begin to seek the right community, for support. If all goes well, you'll recognize when it is in front of you.",2020-10-01,

6822,1,"Amazingly insightful!. I love that I'm listening to this book in the voice of the person who had written it, there's a higher level of connection and understanding to what's being said as it's conveyed by the actual source of ideas from which the book was conceived. A magnificent break down of the simple, yet strange, idea that outstanding success in life is a wonderful, intricate mix of genetic and cultural happenstance, environmental and societal influence, and most importantly, obsessive work ethic and passion for what you do.",2020-09-25,
6823,1,"Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell has a very interesting perspective on why and how people have gained their success. He presented many points I hadn't considered. As an educator, I found the last few chapters very interesting. However, I was wondering where he was going with the rice patties. A bit long winded there. Also, I found the aircraft data beyond the necessary information to round out his point.",2020-09-24,

6825,1,"3rd time I read/ listened to this.. great material. my only issue with it is the fact that even if the greatest, rarest opportunities and circumstances become available to someone very few will run with them and stick to it for at least 10000hrs. that's the critical component that's lacking in this book.",2020-09-24,
6826,1,AMAZING !!!. if you're a person at desires to improve yourself for your life or the ones who love and care about give them this book after you read it and it will give you a blueprint on why certain people are successful and what factors play into their success.,2020-09-21,
6827,1,Loved it. I can’t get enough of Malcolm Gladwell.. Examples that support his thesis are so thoroughly threaded and easily digested. It helps explain the success or failures around us.,2020-09-21,

6829,1,"We are products of our space and time. Best dissection of determinants if success that has ever been written. Malcolm has completed a masterpiece that not only educates the listener, but also gave me a license to suspend a lot of judgement that I usually place on myself. It is not that some are phenomenally smarter better faster than others (while a little of that plays a part), but it is how the conditions in your personal ecosystem combined with your hard work and use of talent make way to outlying circumstances of success. Phenomenal book, and the author reads it to you himself. Could not ask for more. The performance of the read was equally satisfying and of high caliber. I’ve listened to many books on audible, and have never submitted a written review. The revelations of Malcolm’s work in “Outliers” incited me to write my first review. Thank you for this gift of knowledge!",2020-09-19,
6830,1,Good break out book. Great book to start thinking about this topic: aka IQ doesn’t equal success. Another book to read or listen to would be the book ‘Grit’ by Angela Duckworth is how her name is spelled I believe.,2020-09-16,
6831,1,Please give successful people some credit. Only focusing in the environment of the successful people not their own strengths & willpower,2020-09-15,
6832,1,intriguing. fascinating ties into cultural/societal topics. my open-mind grew just that much more. great stuff. thanks,2020-09-14,
6833,1,"Great story about the way the world works. Loved it. Gives perspective about success and failure. How it's not only us, but there are many other factors and it important to remember those and have perspectives in live.",2020-09-14,
6834,1,"Not entirely wrong.. It's almost too obvious that Mr. Gladwell made his conclusion before starting to write this book. I think he makes a great analysis, and the bit about Culture is very interesting. But his conclusion is way too extreme, almost dismissing hard work altogether, even though it's the single trait that every one of his examples have in common.",2020-09-13,
6835,1,"Very good. I liked the narrators voice, it is the type of voice that keeps you interested. Also the book itself has a very entertaining story i really liked and it changed the way i see stuff in life.",2020-09-11,
6836,1,interesting read. Loved the first plot and understood the idea of the book and then different themes added the same thought.,2020-09-10,
6837,1,Amazing Book!. LOVED THIS BOOK. So Eye-opening and Revealing. It really is interesting how it opens your mind into so many things that can take part of how far you can go in life. I really enjoyed Malcom Gladwell's narration. His voice is very enlightening to the ear. And he's very easy to follow.,2020-09-09,
6838,1,I enjoyed this book. Malcolm Gladwell narrates his book very well. They’re are many interesting points he makes that may change your perspective.,2020-09-09,
6839,1,"the man never disappoints. Reading a book by Malcolm Gladwell is like sitting across the kitchen table from a sibling or a cousin who's just enough older that he's had time to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, to see the interconnections you haven't lived long enough to notice, and to lead the conversation with wit, humor, and humility. In a world of pusillanimous blatherskytes, his is a voice of reason and civility.",2020-09-05,
6840,1,Perspective Changing. Excellent read that can change your perspective. This would be a great book to adopt as part of a learning curriculum because it makes you great full for what you have been provided.,2020-09-03,
6841,1,excellent content?. this is real life real lessons. perhaps needed a better rehearsal for performance. thank you,2020-09-01,
6842,1,"Paul Harvey on steroids. If you enjoyed Paul Harvey and the rest of the story, then you will like this. The author finds obscure people and situations then tells the rest of the story. However, when the author goes off on philosophical curiosities, then the story is destroyed. He copies the hockey story from Freakonomics and doesn't give credit. As far as me the reader/listener, I can draw my own curiosities. Thanks Gladwell for some good stories. Perfect for my boring commute.",2020-08-29,
6843,1,The listen was as enjoyable as the read. Having read the book years ago I was obviously familiar with the book's content but having the author Malcom Gladwell actually read it out loud was so much more impact full and might I say intimate. really a fine demonstration of storytelling.,2020-08-29,
6844,1,Not factual. It is just writer's opinion without any scientific fact behind it. I understand it can be applied to many books in this genre but nowadays expectations are higher. If you want to be different from a yellow book you have to include historical or scientific facts. But stories were interesting and you won't get bored.,2020-08-27,
6845,1,"Bombdiggity. Malcolm Gladwell made me think about and look at the world, and the people living in it, from a much broader perspective. I loved it from beginning to end.",2020-08-23,
6846,1,Excellent. The truths are fascinating. My 13yr old son and I both just finished it. Highly recommend it,2020-08-23,
6847,1,"super insightful and very well researched.. the research, data, and analysis provides important insight and context often left out of similar conversations. malcolm performing his own reading as a trained podcaster makes this downright enjoyable to listen to.",2020-08-22,
6848,0,"Of little use. Apart from some interesting anecdotes, the book does not contribute to understanding success. It is obvious to all (I hope) that success derives from a combination of several components among which: talent, ambition, effort and also luck and circumstances. Focusing on luck and circumstances does not help one to understand the key drivers of success that are not in the realm of circumstances.",2020-08-21,
6849,1,Gladwell is always interesting.... I always enjoy Gladwell's books. Always great subject matter. While not my favorite of his books I still highly recommend.,2020-08-20,
6850,1,Amazing. truly one of the best books I've ever listened to. The author uses an evidence-based approach to present a seemingly set a reality about success and it's definition and how it intertwines with opportunity and hard work.,2020-08-20,
6851,1,"Course Material. I enjoyed the first half and second halves separately, to me this book has an overall message and content but could be separated and the end result would be much better.",2020-08-19,
6852,1,"Absolutely fantastic. All should read/listen.. This by far has been my favorite book by Malcolm Gladwell. Interestingly enough, it allowed me to examine my own life and recognize the opportunities, or lack of, that have been presented to me and how those have attributed to my successes and those of my families generations back. The thesis of Outliers is unique and challenges the western culture belief of the individual success. I think it is absolutely fantastic and recommend it to all.",2020-08-18,
6853,1,"Better late than never. This book makes me think of how it would be nice if Gladwell was able to produce and get an elementary, middle or high school version of this book into the hands of millions of little Black and Brown skinned children. If these books made it into the classroom or written into curriculum, #1 it would change the trajectory of thousands of teachers who otherwise might overlook something special in their students motivating them to find opportunities for their students, and #2 it might change the trajectory or thousands of ""hidden outlier"" children who otherwise might overlook something special in themselves, their gifts and abilities. Their would be a heighten sensitivity to always be on the lookout to give children of all gifts, talents, ability, drive and determination opportunities to become more successful than they would ever imagined.",2020-08-15,
6854,1,"There's more to success than just working hard. Malcom outlines a number of scenarios contributing to success. I won't give away too much in the review but there are a number of cultural and community factors that helped create some of the most ""successful"" people. Many of us may not think luck plays a factor but this book tells otherwise. It was a great audiobook.",2020-08-15,
6855,1,How Does He Do It. I loved this book.,2020-08-15,
6856,1,"Loved it !!!!. I enjoyed every minute of it. No, actually every second of it. The performance of Malcolm Gladwell as a narrator was brilliant. There is something in his voice that made listening to this book a mesmerizing experience. The book itself was brilliant as well. I learned so much. I absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to know what makes successful people successful. How opportunity and cultural legacy plays an important role in our life and dictates what we become.",2020-08-14,
6857,1,"Great Perspective!. If you haven't checked out ""Revisionist History"" podcasts you should. Same author in very different topics.",2020-08-09,
6858,1,Loved it! Highly recommended!. Loved it so much I sent it to a friend. The interview at the end was great!,2020-08-08,
6859,1,Some wonderful insights. 80% of the book engaging and insightful for me. Huge thanks to the author for the time spent researching this context!,2020-08-08,
6860,1,Should have read this sooner. A good look at the factors needed to success. Gives you an idea of how you need to think going forward so you can expand your horizons and increase your chances of succeeding in whatever your goal is.,2020-08-07,
6861,1,Life changing. I’ll never look at success and opportunity the same as I did before listening to this book.,2020-08-07,
6862,1,"The secret about Ouliers!. I'm so glad I finally finished this book, I actually stopped reading it for about a week because I thought some of the explanations were BS until everything started to come together in the last 2 chapter's! Good save and i loved his personal story being shared. Outliers are not created as much as they are cultivated for greatness.",2020-08-03,
6863,1,Interesting Insights. I couldnt stop listening— until i had no more to listen to :(,2020-07-30,
6864,1,"Enlightened.. I was enlightened by the stories on the book. Great read, will look for other works by the author.",2020-07-26,
6865,1,Opened my mind. This book will give you an entirely new perception on life. I loved it. Thanks Malcolm,2020-07-25,
6866,1,Excellent read. This is the first Book I have ever read authored by Malcolm Gladwell. I now plan to tear through the rest of his titles ASAP. Excellent thought process. Excellent writing.,2020-07-24,
6867,1,"Fantastic. Perfectly narrated, absolutely worthwhile. I could not stop listening. Powerful, meaningful, and absolutely relevant today. This is a message for anyone who thinks their circumstances are hindering their success. Amazing.",2020-07-23,
6868,1,Another excellent book by Malcolm Gladwell. Can listen to Malcolm talk for hours. Found chapter 4 especially interesting. Being concious of the seemingly tiny yet significant differences in how we raise the next generation is so important. This book will stay with me for years.,2020-07-22,
6869,1,Challenged the Status quo. Are we where we are today because of personal achievement or circumstance? This author highlights the impact of circumstances or chance on success. While most books focus on personal achievement as a reason for success it is refreshing to see success from a different perspective. The author doesn't disregard personal skill but rather highlights that the outliers of our most successful became outliers due to equal parts luck and drive.,2020-07-22,
6870,1,Filled with so much (interesting) information. I thoroughly enjoyed this particular (audio)book by Gladwell. I was reading the book while listening (something I thought I’d try out) and it was a nice accompaniment. Although my books version and the audio varied slightly (must be versions-related) the differences were slight and did not throw me off in anyway.,2020-07-19,
6871,1,I am a big fan of Malcolm. I absolutely love the information from Malcolm Gladwell. I love the intellectual challenge to think and see how we can change our mind and be open minded. Thank you Malcolm,2020-07-18,
6872,1,"Informative, but conclusions are strange. This book outlines some interesting statistics and relationships, but conclusions the author draws seem very strange to me (promotes despair?)",2020-07-17,
6873,1,"Loved it!. There isn't a writer who I enjoy more - especially when he narrates. It builds on the idea that success is all about the amount of quality work you do to achieve it, but he goes into detail to differentiate the circumstances from the top 10 % from the top .001%.  Another awesome book from Mr. Gladwell!!",2020-07-17,
6874,1,Conflicted. This book really makes you think about success in a different way but I feel conflicted probably bc of the American way of making success about the individual which Gladwell mentions in the post book interview. It is entertaining and glad I read it based on a supervisor’s recommendation but couldn’t listen to it when I was relaxing bc his voice put me to sleep on more than one occasion. Will recommend to colleagues and friends.,2020-07-16,
6875,1,Mind blowing. This book opened my eyes to a new world of perspectives that is really changing how I view my own triumphs and failures. I loved it!!!,2020-07-16,
6876,1,"Fantastic!. Success is just the opportunity to work hard, as proven over and over again here. What can we do as a society ro give more people this opportunity? I just love the thought provoking questions asked and the perspectives offered. well worth the listen.",2020-07-14,
6877,1,"Superman Might Not be so Super. I like that this book took a different approach to those that seem to rise above the rest. Gladwell did not glorify, rather, brought them back down to the ground for us to see. It actually follows suit with thoughts on who you surround yourself with and being at the right time in the right place. It isn't the individual as much as having access to the opportunity and proper support. Superman isn't super without his powers nor did he himself create his powers. The one rub with this book is the narration. Gladwell has this sinister tone that would be good as a villain in a1920s detective story or a Batman villain.",2020-07-13,
6878,1,"Awesome!. I didn't follow the chapter about the Jewish lawyers too well, and as such it was a little dry for me, but not too bad. Other than that I absolutely loved it!",2020-07-12,
6879,0,"Very Disappointing. This book was recommended to me a while back and the person that recommended the book was so passionate about it that I was sure I would love it too. But after listening to it, I see why they only raved over very minimal parts. The lessons of ""outliers"" and what they are is very valid and informative, almost inspirational even, but after over 7 hours of listening I maybe took away 4 truly VALUABLE lessons that accounted for less tha an hour of my listening time. This book is unnecessarily long and a lot of the information within doesnt really serve to enhance the lessons this book means to express. You could shave 60% of the content of this book and still get those same messages and honestly, a better reading/listening experience.",2020-07-09,
6880,1,An Interesting Perspective worth understanding. I just have to say Malcolm I love how you weave thoughts and insightful stories into lessons of trying to understand the hows and sometimes whys we humans operate. Wish you could come to Kauai and share more with us here. Wondering with all that’s happening in the world in 2020 what your thoughts are. With your curious mind there must be a book or two in that lovely brain of yours...,2020-07-08,
6881,1,"Good book, well written, faulty premise. Malcolm Gladwell deserves his reputation as a gifted and insightful writer. He sees the world uniquely and has the communication skills to share those insights in meaningful and memorable ways.",2020-07-08,
6882,1,"An excellent misinterpretation of reality. Gladwell is an excellent researcher, phenomenal writer, and a fantastic reader perfectly suited for Audible. I’m grateful for every chapter of this book. His premise, privilege of race and opportunity are the destroyers of a belief in rugged individualism is debunked by his own research into those who’s drive to succeed lead them to prepare, to take any advantage they could find, and never to quit in a country that rewards those who do such. Gladwell’s remarkable research also proves that parents are the greatest influence in a child’s success or lack thereof. Parents instill work ethic, feed or starve emotional intelligence, and elevate or lower their children’s view of their own potential in the world. His assertion that uncontrollable forces such as time of birth and family of birth only reinforce the truth that parents should consider their role sacred.",2020-07-07,
6883,0,Good but way to long. I got some great info out of this book. It’s just very long winded and drawn out. The info learned could have been said in a few chapters.,2020-07-06,
6884,1,"Absolutely fascinating!. This book is absolutely fascinating, and it brings to light so many topics that are more than hot in the current world. But it opens your eyes to a new perspective that might just change the world for the better.",2020-07-05,
6885,1,"Accidents of birth. I’m a new Gladwell fan having only read David and Goliath, and while Goliath hooked me, Outliers reeled me in. I believe in the notion of people being products of their environments, and as an adopted person I know that the culture of my adoptive family is far different than my birth family would have been. I’m also a foreign language teacher and by default culture is very interesting to me. The interplay of culture and time and how we are unwittingly and sometimes unwillingly influenced by them is great food for thought, as is the downplay of being self made and the ideology of individualism.",2020-07-03,
6886,1,Amazing Storytelling. Loved it. This is the second book in a row I have listed to from Malcolm Gladwell. I love the way he unpacks each chapter peeling each layer and then beautifully bringing it back to the main thesis. I am a fan.,2020-07-03,
6887,1,I highly recommend. One of the best books I ever read!!!! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about success.,2020-07-02,
6888,1,Teaches a lot. it was a very good book I would 100% recommend. The book is mainly about when you are born advantages in everyday things whether it's when you are born or who you meet.,2020-07-02,
6889,1,"Amazingly insightful. Malcolm gladwell goes deep behind the secrets of some of the most famous and successful individuals. It is a ride that is worth taking a million times over, can't wait to read it again.",2020-07-02,
6890,1,Out standing book you have to enjoy. I absolutely loved this book because it shines a light on to so many biases that we all have and why we have them,2020-07-01,
6891,1,amazing book. this is a trully great book with amazing analysis that makes you think about success,2020-06-30,
6892,1,Insightful and honest breakdown of success. A book that torces a person to have an honest conversation with society and self,2020-06-29,
6893,1,"Eye opening insight. Loved it. It should be a part of school's required reading. Opportunity is key for everyone! Perhaps maybe take turns narrating chapters with someone, so that it is not so monotone.",2020-06-26,
6894,1,Another Great Title from Malcolm. Malcolm is a great story teller and this book doesn't disappoint. His ideas on this book are spot on and very interesting. They bring a fresh perspective on what drives success and I must say I agree with most of what he presents. I've recommended this book to quiet of friends already.,2020-06-25,
6895,1,"Great book!. Loved the content! Very interesting observations, will definitely have to get the book for my collection",2020-06-24,
6896,1,"On brand for Gladwe. Classic Gladwell. Mostly makes really compelling points. A couple of his arguments are a bit of a stretch. Does a great job of showing how historical, socioeconomic, and cultural context shape our abilities and opportunities. Worth the read.",2020-06-24,
6897,1,Amazing. I love the look at the inner workings of success and what actually makes an individual or a group successful.,2020-06-24,

6899,1,A life of privileges. Great perspective of malcom about how sucess is related to personal privileges and circumstances.,2020-06-23,
6900,1,A must read. what an eye-opening book. It is very interesting and straight to the point. I definitely recommend it,2020-06-23,
6901,1,Wonderful book and narrated well.. Very much enjoyed Outliers. To me it is always interesting and educational to learn the “root of the history of events. Great read.,2020-06-23,
6902,1,Everyone should read this book. Malcolm Gladwell is a master at dispelling the useless cultural narratives we create to explain success.,2020-06-23,
6903,1,fucking love it.. very stimulating if you thrive on information. Nice that the author narrates. fucking top of the line,2020-06-22,
6904,1,Definitely check this book out!. Talks about how people were able to achieve what they have by doing repeats. also by being blessed,2020-06-20,
6905,1,Phenomenal!. I really enjoyed the reading this book period from the beginning the story telling back a by facts and history made it such an easy read. I love the way he describes the stories paints the characters and open your eyes to events so simple yet extraordinary. I highly recommend this book.,2020-06-18,
6906,1,One of the greats. A must read for those interested in human success and development. Style is unique but it all comes together at the end.,2020-06-16,
6907,1,Always a great and thought provoking read. Learn insights on the world outliers and the hidden factors to their succuss. Why are great people great? The answer will surprise you. Malcolm as per usual dives deep into the hidden factors that lead to greatness.,2020-06-14,
6908,1,"another must read. Gladwell does it again. like always, everyone needs to read this book. and check their own reality, or understand the reality of people around them.",2020-06-11,
6909,1,"eye opening. It's an eye-opening take of what variables lead to success, and makes you question your firmly held beliefs and how successful people make it.",2020-06-08,
6910,1,Super fascinating. I may have experienced the largest single paradigm shift reading this book than any other I’ve read a single time.,2020-06-07,
6911,1,Interesting Subject Matter. Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of explaining his thesis that the outliers we see and idolize worked hard for their success but would not have achieved any notoriety in their field had it not been for some incredible timing and cultural background that come into play.,2020-06-07,
6912,1,"Entertaining regardless of its flaw. Yeah it's really a biased cherry-picked work of pop-sci writing, but it still entertaining as hell. This book is good to listen to on your commute and is short enough to be addicting, but please don't derive any life lessons from this book.",2020-06-07,
6913,1,brilliant. loved it yet again!! all the books are awesome,2020-06-04,
6914,0,No real advise about being successful.. I felt the whole book took success out of your hand and out it all on luck. Practical but not very helpful professionally.,2020-06-03,
6915,1,insightful book on what it takes to get ahead. every school district in America should read this book because it dispels many notions and tells what really creates success. The example of the KIPP School in New York City is a particular interest.,2020-06-02,
6916,1,"This Book Changed My Life. I am now putting in my 10,000 hours. I wake up at 4 AM and put in 8 hours everyday towards my music. I am seeing a huge improvement and it’s only been a month. If I knew what I know right now I’d be better than I ever been. Thank you for this wonderful book. Thank you for giving me the wisdom to make my dreams a reality. If you have a dream this book will give you the fuel you need as well as the wisdom to make it happen. A fantastic listen/ read. I am going to buy the physical copy and re read this book every month.",2020-06-01,

6919,1,Great book!!!. Great book. It’s a bit slow at beginning but worth the read. Will reinforce key behaviors.,2020-05-28,
6920,1,fantastic. This was fantastic. My perspective widened in a very good way. It's motivating to know that hard work is a lot of the basis of success and other aspects are not under your control.,2020-05-28,
6921,1,Great book. A good listen. He definitely puts our ideologies to the test and explains his theory and follows it up with interesting facts to back it up.,2020-05-28,

6924,1,Fell in love with Audible because of this!. I played it in 1.25x and sometimes at 1.75x speed but it was still very clear and understandable. I appreciate the feeling of accomplishment after finally finishing a book without missing a word or thought in most likely 10% of my usual time when reading. I appreciate the notes or bookmark too although I didn't really bookmark so much here since it was more of a story telling or practical type rather than a conceptual/theoretical. Enjoyed this book 100%!,2020-05-26,

6928,1,Good book with great stories. And a fun read. The points Malcolm Gladwell makes are definitely accurate. And there’s an interesting set of anecdotes.,2020-05-20,
6929,1,This book illuminates success. Here's another book that I've enjoyed of Malcolm Gladwell. A fascinating read and eye opening.,2020-05-20,
6930,1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. But 5 Stars!!!!!. do not read this book!!!!! ... if you are uncomfortable with someone pointing out how much of a bad hand you were dealt in life lol. this book basically summed me up. it was painful to read but so fascinating and I learned so much about myself.,2020-05-20,
6931,1,"Gladwell makes a great case for ONE important aspect of success.. If you’re looking for motivation or ways to boost your chances of success, you may be disappointed. The author makes an excellent case for background including culture, the year that you were born, and opportunities handed down as being the most important reason behind success. However, he neglects to mention the importance of mindset as well as personality traits such as self awareness and stepping out of your comfort zone in order to PUT yourself in positions to receive more opportunities which I’m sure many would argue are the other major factors in success. Regardless, this book is still worth a listen as you will gain more insight into one of the many aspects of what makes successful people.",2020-05-20,
6932,0,Kinda shitty. Not much useful information at all. Not even all that interesting. So many ideas could’ve been easily summarized.,2020-05-19,
6933,1,Loved it!. Very interesting and insightful. It really gets you thinking about your own circumstances and how you have achieved your own milestones in life,2020-05-18,
6934,1,Would recommend. I liked the book and it was easy to listen. I also started looking success differently.,2020-05-18,
6935,1,The Myth of the Self-Made Man Exploded. Gladwell's brilliant ability to research and weave the results together in a comprehensible fashion is on full display in Outliers. Opportunity remains crucial in success and our public policy should all revolve around increasing it for everyone. Gladwell is the rarest of gems as a teacher for the world.,2020-05-15,
6936,1,Great book. Great book. Really makes you think and reevaluate what it is that you see.,2020-05-14,

Interesting theory on how successful people are actually have been made, and it will make you rethink how many factors are actually involved in “making it”. Timing/ethnicity/cultural environment etc. are detrimental to success, as much as hard work and perseverance.",2020-05-06,

6951,1,Good listen. Great story telling and some very interesting hypotheses. Well worth the listen for my taste,2020-04-27,
6952,1,fascinating. A very interesting twist on the paths of success and how the external forces in our world have as much power as our own drive in achieving mastery.,2020-04-26,
6953,1,"A convincing argument about exception people. I really enjoyed every chapter, and the narration by the author is great. I found the only downside to be a lack of counter examples or consideration for counterarguments. This doesn't significantly detract from the book though and the overall message. I found the moral of the book to be something truly valuable which we all should deeply consider.",2020-04-23,

6955,1,"Malcolm Gladwell is my favorite author/narrator. I didn’t discover Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, like many did, instead I became aware of him as the producer of Against The Rules, a podcast by Michael Lewis. The last episode is an interview with Gladwell and I really enjoyed him. So then I started listening to Talking With Strangers, and I LOVED it. Then I listened to Outliers and since then I’ve finished David and Goliath. Malcolm Gladwell is the perfect narrator for his own books. He doesn’t feel the need to impose himself on the listening experience and at the same time, he knows exactly where the emphasis needs to be. He is masterful at this genre and I can’t wait to listen to everything else he’s written/narrated.",2020-04-21,
6956,1,Spending time to build.... Loved the book...,2020-04-20,

6958,1,Pretty good. An exquisite recap that shows the relevance of context for the development of human beings.,2020-04-15,
6959,1,So Intruiging. This book paints such a unique picture of many familiar success stories. really it made me think,2020-04-15,
6960,1,Extraordinary book!. The reasons for success are not what we've been led to believe and Gladwell's study of successful people is an illuminating and often fascinating insight.,2020-04-13,

6962,1,"This book will make you more intelligent!. I learned new things throughout this book. I had so many ah-ha moments. What a well researched, yet fun to listen to book.

6966,1,"Worth a listen, but seems like cherry picking.. Definitely some good points, and worth a listen, but I think a lot of his points are skewed. I do think environment matters, but the point he's making is that someone like Bill Gates wouldn't be in the place he's at without a lot of help. Sure. Duh. But how many other people had similar benefits/privileges and simply wasted them? I've sure seen people with tons of blessings heaped on them simply waste their gifts with virtually identical social factors (siblings, etc.). Could you point out differences? Sure. But I think personal factors aren't given enough weight in his calculations.",2020-04-07,

6968,1,"Great Book!. As a millennial, the principles laid out in this book shaped how I see the professional world and how mentors in my life gave guidance. Growing up, the term “ten thousand hours” became a cliche when talking about reaching the apogee of a certain field. After listening to this book, I understand the nuance and true meaning behind that statement: simply working hard for 10,000 hours doesn’t get you to the pinnacle of your profession; rather, unique opportunities propel you to unprecedented heights when combined with 10,000 hours of determined effort. Still work hard. I listened to the whole book in less than 24 hours because of quarantine. I highly recommend this book. While it’s his most famous work, it’s not his best, but it’s still very interesting.",2020-04-06,

6973,1,"Thought Provoking. This is the first book I've listened to by Malcolm Gladwell and I was not disappointed. He challenges conventional thinking regarding an individual's success.

6989,1,"Interesting facts and interpretations. I agree that successful people are products of circumstances and effort. However, the author elevates the importance of uncontrollable circumstance above hard work and controlled circumstances. In my experience in life, a lot of people, if not most, choose the path of least resistance. Opportunities are there, but they don't take it. Also, much of the circumstances that we find ourselves are products of our of own choices. The author brings the fact that he, by fortune, became best friends with intelligent people, but that was his choice. He didn't need to continue to be friends. I did enjoy the facts presented and the interpretations. Gave me valuable insight into different social and cultural structures.",2020-03-21,

After the 2016 election, there's been much talk about privilege and what it means to grow up with opportunities others don't have. I sort of have up on that topic until I read Outliers.

7001,1,"Simply put: what wonderfully entertaining education!. The most entertaining delivery of new insights into what really stands behind personal achievement. Gladwell presents such in-depth study of the questions he asks that he unearths many more answers than I ever thought were there, and I learned more about my own story than I had ever considered in the past. His books are all great, but this one has been the best of them.",2020-03-06,

7003,1,"Gladwell always delivers. I love Malcolm Gladwell. his narrations are really good in my opinion find his stories are even better, and I love how he supports everything that he says with studies and research. she is very informative and this book is a mush read, some people should also take every opportunity that they can",2020-03-05,
7004,1,"An intriguing read. I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's podcasts and articles in the New Yorker, but it took me a while to get around to this book. It was nice to hear the story told in Malcolm's own words, and I found the points he mentioned interesting and sometimes surprising. The overall message is that success is as much a product of a persons upbringing, culture and circumstances, as it is to how hard that person worked or how 'smart' they are. I liked that Malcolm concluded with the fact that anyone is capable of being successful as long as they are given the opportunity to practise their talents, but I can see how this opinion might be a little depressing to those who feel like they've missed out or were not offered these opportunities.",2020-03-04,
7005,1,a book that truly worth spending time listening!. this is definitely a great book. full of information that supports the author idea. I have read three of the author's book. I can wait to get my hands of the rest of his work. Highly recommend it!,2020-03-04,
7006,1,"Interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed listening to this but I can't help but discredit the conclusions made by the author a little bit due to the inaccuracy of one fact he presented in the book. According to him, Singaporeans are outliers when it comes to math championship because they come from an agricultural society, in particular rice planting nation. The cultural belief that one must wake up before the crack of down to be rich (grow, harvest, etc.) certainly didn't come from this.",2020-03-03,

7012,0,"Boring. Sorry, the basis of this book is simple to grasp and could have been explained in half the words.

7015,1,Gladwell's best. This is Malcoms best book in my opinion. Each chapter has interesting topics that connect one chapter to the next. Overall theme is great. He doesn't drone on like some of his other books.,2020-02-29,
7016,1,"Easy and fun. Loved al the stories in this book, especially about the Beatles, Bill Gates and professional hockey. But what sticks is the detailed research and insight into why these people are so successful. Malcolm's prose and story telling makes the pages turn quickly.

7023,1,a great read.. Gladwell really put success into perspective. He looks at the whole picture rather than the cliff notes version. He teaches the value of hardwork and the result of ceasing an opportunity. I really enjoyed this listen.,2020-02-20,
7024,1,Great book to make you think. When you read this book you will realize that success is not just working hard but a series of situations that Foster success. Very interesting perspective on a lot of different things.,2020-02-19,

This book was very interesting and there is a lot of research to support the arguments made, except for the final section in the main book which tried to make some pretty broad claims about rice and entrepreneurial drive as the important reason for Asian skills with math.

I listened to Talking to Strangers first, and my initial impression was, What was that about? One gets a general notion of what Gladwell is trying to say in both books. However,if it were not for the title of the books, there would probably be a lot of head scratching in Gladwell's audience.",2020-02-09,

7046,1,great book interesting perspective. I like the other point of view how he look at things and so the different perspective how we analyze and see the world is very unique and different basically break it down everybody can be successful if they had the right situation in their life are born at the right time so the circumstance basically relate to your own come or how your life might turned out or how your life will be and is a very interesting perspective I like the other point of view so that's my thought in the whole book,2020-02-03,

7053,1,"Interesting Angle, But Acknowledge the Work Done. This is a great book and it definitely brings up some incredible points! It fails to hit on one important point though: the people discussed in the stories still had to put in an incredible amount of work. This point is barely touched on, almost passed over. Yes the people discussed had incredible opportunity thanks to the times and locations and even months they were born. But this is never enough. You still have to put in the work. The author almost makes it seem like anyone could have been Bill Gates born under the right conditions. I disagree. Not everyone with access to a computer in the late 1960’s would get out of bed at 2:30AM to program at 3:00AM. Plain and simple. The outliers are the people who engaged in incredibly hard work, and had some luck and help and opportunity along the way. The work still had to be done though. I agree with what the author is saying mostly, and yet I find it a bit discrediting to people’s achievements. I believe this is the other extreme of the individualism scale talking. Listen to the book and draw your own conclusions. Definitely a worthwhile read though and time well spent. Excellent book!",2020-01-29,

7056,1,Must listen!. The author explains the reason behind the success of successful people. I loved his reasonings and his style of storytelling. Every chapter connects the other very well. I couldn't stop listening in one go. Thanks for this excellent book!,2020-01-26,
7057,1,"Just mind-opening!. I have been hearing about Malcolm Gladwell for years and thinking he was bright and that I ought to read his books, but never found myself in the mood. I’m so glad I finally jumped in! They are not “difficult reads” and the way he explains things and provides concrete examples seems effortless and enjoyable. I can’t say enough positive things about this book and his others.",2020-01-25,

7060,1,"WOW, Amazing, I've always wondered about how some. I've always wondered how people like the ones in this book got started and where they came from. The Bill Gates got me the most. I almost didnt make it pasted the 1880s part because I am Washoe native and just got done listening to Black Elks story. So I did and from there it took me into another world of thinking. Your decoding is amazing. This to me is kind of a guide book. Thank you.",2020-01-24,

7064,1,thanks for your perspective. I was homeless after being raped and abandoned by my family at 13. My daughter was also raped then abandoned by her father and my granddaughter the product of this rape is repeating this pattern by running away from chaos in the city caused by a false narrative of 'white privilige' because they feel guilty about forcing women into prostitution and sex industry but she also is repeatedly abandoned by her grandfather who abandoned my daughter repeatedly...,2020-01-22,
7065,1,Paul.L. it's a powerful tool for young people. I recommend it to positive thinkers out there!,2020-01-22,
7066,1,Eye Opening. Gladwell's research is so thought provoking and eye opening. It helps me look at my family's history in a different light. It also brings light into circumstances that led up to the adoption of my son who is a Romanian gypsy. A must read/listen.,2020-01-22,

7075,1,"Initially deceived by tital, pleasantly surprised. Thought this book was going to be a glorification of the ""outliers"" in our society. Instead it explains why and how they became outliers, in a way that is interesting and insightful.",2020-01-18,

7085,1,"a book I will re read several times. such compelling information to remind us that genius is more than the individual. it's motivating to me to keep trying and searching for my ""right moment"" and to work on looking for ways to create those right moments and opportunities for others.",2020-01-12,
7086,1,"Great story formation. Really well written book with lots of examples to support the hypothesis on how we define success. It gave a clear description of how much circumstances, cultural legacy and being at the right place at the right time governs the different opportunities available. I really liked the part where, through the plane crash example, communication gap between different cultures was explained! Overall the idea that everyone is ordinary and sometime having the right motivation and presence of mind to make the most of the opportunities available was mentioned with elaborate illustrations of most of famous figures.",2020-01-10,

7088,1,Loved it!. Will definitely recommend it! It started off a bit slow for me personally but the further into the book you go the more it gets into you. So I loved it!,2020-01-09,
7089,1,This book is an Outlier. This book is phenomenal. The intellectual setups within the stories around success are one of a kind. This book sets to debunk myths and ideas around how people attain success. It’s looks at individuals and situations and holds a magnifying glass to it to study the different set of factors that contribute to creating these success outliers. This is a must read.,2020-01-08,
7090,1,great!. A different perspective I didn't give enough thought ...loved this book will definitely reread And reread,2020-01-07,

7093,1,Life changing. Changes your perspective and thinking,2020-01-06,
7094,1,"Interesting Read. While the book was interesting it could be summed up in two words, God's Providence. While the author sheds needed light on several examples of ""success "", success is not the same thing for everyone. Wealth, property, possessions and power are not equivalent to ""success"". So, while it is interesting to see tje relationship between certain forms of success and the hidden causes it only has limited value.",2020-01-05,
7095,1,Stories that resonate. There were several examples in this book that were extremely interesting and offered a fresh perspective but ultimately it seems like the stars aligned and the perfect combination of factors influenced success in many of the big stories.,2020-01-04,
7096,1,"Fantastic listen!!. Can listen to this in one sitting or ""standing"" on a Saturday while working in the shop. So many great examples of outliers and how western society should adjust our views of those who have succeeded. Spoiler alert... It's more than just ....",2020-01-04,

7099,1,Joe Rogan Interview Brought me here. LOVED THIS BOOK! After listening to Malcolm Gladwell on the JRE Podcast I found him fascinating. I had to get his book. I was very pleased to see that he read for this Audio Book. I cant wait to hear/read his other books. I heard that his other books were just as rewarding.,2019-12-31,

7106,1,"My first Gladwell. Parts resonated for me, while others seemed farfetched. There's a difference between causation and correlation which the author fails to acknowledge.",2019-12-22,
7107,1,"Cannot Recommend Enough!. I don’t take the time to write many reviews, because it isn’t often that I think the book was worth me taking the time to do more than give a star rating. But, I do think that this is one of those books that EVERYONE needs to listen to.",2019-12-21,
7108,1,"Awesome book. Great book, really enjoyed the premise and the supporting stories! Gladwell makes the stories come to life!",2019-12-19,
7109,1,great book with a lot of great information. while the story provides a great amount of information I feel that at times Gladwell dives a little more into the back story than needs he needs to.,2019-12-17,

7115,1,"If you are already a fan this is a must have. I'm a big Malcolm Gladwell fan, and this is my second favorite only to David and Goliath. The structure of the story is solid and very interesting. Finished it in about 3 days easily.",2019-12-10,
7116,1,One of the best books I’ve read to date.. After reading this book it will be imposible not to consider it in my daily decisions.,2019-12-06,
7117,1,"Great idea in the book but not a full explanation of outliers. I liked the book until the very last bit where the author starts summarizing the book as those with more privilege than others. Although I agree with this point of view to an extent , it is not the full story. The truth is privilege is a factor but not the only variable in successful. Effort & focus are better predictors of success because any person has control over those. Just saying people are privileged if they’re successful doesn’t help anyone in fact it hurts society by instilling doubt in the individual due to his lack of privilege.",2019-12-03,
7118,1,In Love with this Author. This a beautifully written book and well-read. I am a new fan of this author.,2019-11-30,

7120,1,"Love another Malcolm book!. This book is a great read! It was interesting, deep, and provided clarity to issues that we often wonder, ""what really happened?!"" This is my second Malcolm Gladwell book, my first was..""Talking to Strangers."" This will not be my last, I enjoy the material as well as him narrating...it keeps me hooked! Love it...thank you Malcolm for another great book!",2019-11-24,
7121,1,"Love Malcolm Gladwell. I'm always a sucker for a book that convey their ideas through real stories and Data. Malcolm does a fantastic job, especially in Outliers of doing just that. It's intriguing, thought provoking and entertaining. I also am grateful when authors narrate their own books. I think it just helps you get into the ideas their trying to make and there overall spirit of the book",2019-11-21,
7122,1,"Interesting stories, overreaching conclusions. Gladwell provides some interesting examples and good food for thought but as he moves through the book his conclusions seem to move away from a scientific curiosity and towards a social commentary which diminishes to great measure the hard work put in by the individuals mentioned to achieve their status as outliers. Some of his explanations came across as simplistic and at times very fatalistic. A light enough read that's worth it for the stories if not all the analysis and conclusions.",2019-11-21,
7123,1,Incredible. Eye opening everyone needs to listen or read. I’ll look for more from Malcom! Thanks.,2019-11-19,

7129,1,Interest overview of successful people. I love Malcolm Gladwell way of putting basic concepts and aspects of life in a very interesting and different perspective,2019-11-11,
7130,1,"Very interesting take on outliers. I enjoyed Gladwell's counter intuitive take on outliers. It got me thinking. I however still feel there is a missing link. Yes, Bill Gates did have opportunity at the age of 13, but so did all the other 13 year olds in his privileged school. The state of the art computer room wasn't just his. Yet, they didn't start a multibillion empire. It takes an inherent outlying characteristic to grab the opportunity and run with it. Playing piano takes practice...10000 hours of it but it takes an inherent drive, passion and dedication to put in those hours. That is what makes an outlier an outlier...the got what it takes given the opportunity.",2019-11-10,
7131,1,"Enlightening!!. Malcolm Gladwell has some important insights to share on the topic of success and debunks some misconceptions about rags to riches tales.....truly inspiring stories on everything from hockey, education and technology.",2019-11-10,
7132,1,Great book!. details about how or why someone is successful and how to become...must read.,2019-11-08,
7133,1,"awesome book but i think he rushed the ending. I really lovedthe book.And the writimg is very very good and pleasant to read. I do think Malcom does miss an opportunity that perhaps he will work on in a secomd book. Malcom takes the long standing argument between librals and conservatives of accountability vs circumstance and supports enviornmental influences on peoples lives with very high quality arguments. I really appreciate the quailty of the reaarch and the well placed word while making the argument of nuture over nature. The point he misses is at the end he calls for change at the societal level and rebridges the gap between librals and conservatives. I think Malcom need to take his findings, keep the persuasion of the influence of the envioronment on success, but then focus on the HOW wnvironment was overcome and promote individual accountability to change not just societal pressures but personal or cultural changes that people have power over. I kept expecting that part two would show how thechange of Korean Airs saftey record was implenented, the hard choices to make cultural changes are to lightly pressed upon. Had he focused on How succesfull organizations (including familes) used the understanding of culture to change their outcomes or even understanding, Malcom would have briged the gap between liberals and conservatives and more than likely, over time exerted more influence of the necessary socitial changea he belives should be made.",2019-11-07,
7134,1,intriguing. Couldn't wait to learn the backstory of how famous people really succeeded. Appreciated the sound research.,2019-11-04,
7135,1,"To sum it up, you can be lucky, or not. I enjoyed listening to the book, however, in the end, Gladwell concludes that an outlier for success is heavily determined by opportunities given to us from the moment we were born. This strikes little hope for those who want to be successful but weren't lucky enough to be born into an environment capable of guiding them to success.",2019-11-04,
7136,1,"another great book from the author. I love the mix of history, psychology, statistics, and sociology. Gladwell does a great job at taking a look at topics from other perspectives.",2019-11-04,
7137,0,"Collectivist tripe, don’t waste your time. Gladwell attacks a strawman idea of individualism. This is the literary equivalent of President Obama’s “you didn’t build that“ statement.",2019-10-31,
7138,1,Pretty good. Very interesting.. Good outcomes are a combination of lucky circumstances to set up people to be able to work hard. If people combine those lucky circumstances with their own effort and intelligence that's a recipe for success.,2019-10-31,
7139,0,"Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell. The author combines the envious theory of socialism, mixed with self guilt, adds a dash of interesting stories and comes up with a transparent, flat manifesto of ""Free Societies are Fake"". He leads with a story of how the DOB of kids in elite Canadian hockey predicates their success. It hooks the reader. The story has merit and is interesting. There are a couple more catchy tales like the Montana rancher vs. Oppenhiemer and the Chinese rice farmer and rationale how the Chinese language is better for math. After these however it becomes clear that Mr. Gladwell wrote this book to push his beliefs that socialism is far superior a free society. Mr. Gladwell, IT HAS BEEN TRIED and failed all over the world. Eventually you simply out of other people's money to spent. The idea that there could have been hundreds or thousands of Bill Gates' if computers would have been supplied to everyone is purely a utopian pipe drem but it is an approach Socialists have asserted many times throughout history. One of the key elements the author chooses to exclude are the choices people make. Granted, if every person would have made the same choices as Bill Gates when afforded the use of computers then there would have been more Bill Gates' but we are talking about living breathing human beings and it simply doesn't translate. Choices are a much more important component in a free society than in a socialism/communism. The author's rhetoric really only accomplishes 2 things. Number one, it decreases his feelings of self guilt for being born into a ""privileged and entitled"" family. Quite simply, it makes him feel better about himself and number two it improves his public appearance by using his ""entitlement and privilege"" for the good of all those less fortunate. Again, an attempt to make himself feel better.  It is clear that you despise the thought that a person can be independent. I don't know where or why you have formed these concepts but I bet it is a product of how YOUR surroundings have influenced YOU. I gave your book 5 stars for the specific stories you tell but had to subtract three stars for the way you use them to justify the worn out idea of Socialism. I hope you will take all the money you make from you book sales and use it top make your self feel better because you are such a good person you deserve to feel good about yourself...in fact you are entitled to it.",2019-10-30,

7151,1,"Extremely Helpful. The facts of life contained in this book should be shared everywhere. So many gems of wisdom would benefit the potential outliers as children, if they only knew what hard work can become. One thing to note is there were opportunities to make less sacrifices in each of the cases discussed, but these outliers had a mindset to aggressively pursue their area of interest in every opportunity granted to them. Many will not have exceptional opportunities ever at their doorstep, but for those few who have only one exceptional opportunity, this book should be taught early so that they can begin to evaluate opportunities in a much more educated way.",2019-10-18,

7155,0,"Completely biased and mostly unfounded.. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Malcolm Gladwell has profited greatly by selling people the idea that they want to believe. That is, that success involves so many aspects of luck and random opportunity, that most of us never stand a chance.",2019-10-15,
7156,1,Amazing what we don't take in to consideration.. This book was spectacular. I thought I might get bored and not like it but I wanted to finish it in one day!! One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. I would recommend to anyone.,2019-10-14,
7157,1,"Luck plays an important role in our lives. This book seems narrating a point of you after having collected a lot of data. Often books on these topics are just opinion not based on facts or data. This is different and shows how much the author had investigated the topic. It’s nicely narrated. Some chapters are slower and repetitive that others, especially toward the end of the book.",2019-10-13,

7161,1,"Truly exceptional. I simply could not put this book down. I didn’t think that it would have quite the impact on me that it has. As a self proclaimed entrepreneur, this book gives me a ton of gratitude for where I came from where my parents came from and their parents came from. I’ve always considered myself lucky, but this puts it in a much greater perspective. I don’t want to give anything away, but if you are on the fence I strongly suggest that you give this a listen.",2019-10-07,
7162,1,"Insightful. Insightful and common sensical, Outliers spoke to me in particular as someone from a working class family.

7163,1,"Opportunity + Work = Success. Makes the case that every outlier got there by a set of circumstances. It's like saying, the spire on top of a building got there by a set of preconditions.

7164,1,Excellent Conclusions. We all like to think that people who make it as the ideal in their respective field are somehow special. They are... just in ways we didn't think. This book does a great job in illustrating patterns in society and the villages that raise our children and ultimately our outliers.,2019-10-05,
7165,1,Finally I understand what does work hard mean. Outliers is a book explaining what is hard work.

I found myself evangelizing Malcolm Gladwell’s ideas to anyone that would listen. I loved the overall concepts surrounding cultural legacies, environments, timing, and other influences as they pertain to shaping a person that becomes successful. This is, of course, in direct contradiction to the conventional ideas we usually attribute success to. i.e. Individuals are solely responsible for their success, and hard work alone is the key to finding said success. Gladwell does not challenge the idea of hard-work, but he does emphasize that it’s only one part of an overall mix of contributing factors. We are shaped by our experiences, environment, cultures, parents, mentors, privilege....",2019-05-22,

I agree whole heartily that is part of what makes anyone great is the family, opportunities, culture, community they grew up in. We all stand the shoulders of giants. But we also choose to work har and take risks where many could have but chose not to. I believe being self made is a choice someone makes, but their is a lot luck with no fault of your which allows you to choose to be self made. For example have a stable home, going to a good school, having a good mentor etc.",2019-04-24,

7303,1,"Very good read. I appreciate the evidence the author provides, however, I believe he discounts, and even discredits, the hard work and perseverance these individuals put into becoming great. There are millions of people born into opportunistic environments every year in which these people squander opportunity.",2019-02-27,
7304,1,Eye opening!. This isn't the first book written by the author that blows my mind; but I was so moved by his innovative approach on the topic of success and self made individuals. I am a product of Romanian immigrants and my children will be first generation Americans. Their success will be directly linked to our journey as naturalized citizens. I am so happy I decided to read this and look forward to Malcolm's future books!!!,2019-02-27,

7306,1,What a thought provoking book. I will no longer look at someone’s story to success as “on the face of it” this book helped me understand that there are so many variables that contribute to success.,2019-02-26,
7307,1,"Makes One Seek Opportunity. It was a great listen, it really made me reevaluate how I look at my employees. It helped me check my bias concerning individualism. It helped me look at outside factors and how those affect success. It was definitely an eye opening book.",2019-02-24,

7314,1,"Good book, but overlooks obvious things.. Basic thesis of the book: people are only successful due in large part to opportunities afforded them (which come in various forms, culture, computer access, birthday, type of job their parents had etc). While yes these opportunities are huge—Bill Gates wouldn’t have become the person he is without the Mom’s club buying that computer for his school. (Example from the book) He wasn’t the only kid at that school who had access to that opportunity. On a more broad scale, yes a January Birthday is an advantage to aspiring Canadian hockey players but not all those who are born in January go pro. There are deeper levels in the individual outliers that enable them to achieve. Even taking his theory at face value, wouldn’t the real outliers be the pro players born in December?? Study them. The January kid should succeed. (Again this is another example from the book). I think the book makes a good point that a lot of times successful people had incredible advantages, what it doesn’t delve into is the difference between them and the other people who had the exact same advantages!",2019-02-17,
7315,0,"Long-winded tunnel vision. I thought the chapter (s?) about air travel would never end! Aside from that, I found too many missing variables as to explain success. The author fails to give credit for individual pioneers, yet ironically gives credit to a collective of group thought. Individuals, particularly religious ones, have historically lost EVERYTHING (family, land, wealth, status, etc) in an attempt to raise the standard across cultures. Many of them have been ostracized or stoned to death by the collective because they like their concubines. They like having slaves. And they love their power. The USA was built on a culture of individualism because it CREATES. It was also built upon the fortitude of individuals who have continually shattered the culture of collectivism. Should they succeed, and be rewarded for their success? YES, because they pave the way for others to live their own individual dreams, and keep building layers, as well. Bill Gates' story is an example of a mentor who fought HARD, you can bet, to obtain or create the equipment Bill learned by. As evidenced by the fact that it wasn't available to the collective, because for the whole, their standard is lower. Individuals reject the bucket of lobsters trying to pull them back down and find a way to climb out. Making a lot of money for their effort is an organic side effect. Idividualism is the crust holding in the apple pie. Without it, we just have applesauce.",2019-02-17,
7316,1,Great book. This book is so fascinating. It opens ones mind to the reality of life and opportunities. Great book!,2019-02-15,

7322,1,"Awesome. This book was awesome, I enjoyed tipping point when I was given it as a gift a few years back and now this one just took it up another notch",2019-02-12,
7323,1,Must listen. This should be required reading/listening for everyone. The stories are broken down and easily digestible while multitasking.,2019-02-06,
7324,1,Awesome. I really enjoyed the author's perspective. I'm glad there was an interview at the end to further explain some connections I missed. it's always nice to have the author reading their text!,2019-02-01,
7325,1,Easily one of the most perspective changing books I have read. This book will truly cause you to see the world in an entirely different way. This new perspective can be used as an incredible tool in your own life and in the lives of others.,2019-01-31,
7326,1,"Interesting take on patterns we may or may not see. Mr. Gladwell authors and reads this text. It seems a hefty read so I am appreciative of this audio narrative format. The examples and cases cited in the text elaborate on his general thoughts and appear to be mostly thought out. There are several cases however, such as the folks in the Appalachians or the Chinese and mathematics, that seem quite a stretch and, for me, not entirely plausible. Not that they, or other cases, are lacking in evidence or researched argumentation, just that what is presented for some of the cases does not make convincing justifications for the thesis of that particular chapter (again, such as folks feuding in Appalachia or Chinese and mathematical ability). It's an interesting book and take on patterns we encounter in everyday life, but I just don't think the justification for each chapter's thesis was entirely plausible.",2019-01-30,
7327,1,chefjoewead. This was probably the most eye-opening Book I've ever read! Absolutely unbelievable! Malcolm Gladwell knocked it out of the park!,2019-01-30,
7328,1,"Very interesting, good storytelling. I thought Gladwell does a great job telling stories and a relatively good job at keeping them interesting. I feel like this type of books always struggles to keep your attention throughout because you almost have to make some significant conclusions early to entice readers to continue. The rest of the book comes off anticlimactic. Outliers does a good job but I still felt like 80% of the closure was found in the first 20% of the book, or something along those lines. I enjoyed that he didn't shy away from conclusions that might be viewed as politically incorrect.",2019-01-28,
7329,1,"A New Favorite. I highly recommend anyone with ambition to read this book. It does not necessarily provide answers, but it certainly provides the right questions along with really interesting examples and thought-provoking correlations.",2019-01-27,
7330,1,"Good data. I think the data presented paints an amazing picture, but also support to contradict some of the authors conclusions. His part on China and Chinese culture and their value on hard work works against his conclusion that hard work is not the basis for success. I think many things can be true that seem to contradict each other. We need people in our lives to grow, our culture can give us advantages, and hard work will fuel you through these advantages to succees. Good book.",2019-01-25,
7331,0,"Interesting but pointless information. I have enjoyed MG’s books before but I fail to take away any real and meaningful value from this text. Outliers discusses why some are famous, wealthy, expert etc. First you’re led to believe the infamous 10,000 hours is all you need but then you realize the real controls on your success are out of your control.",2019-01-21,

7333,1,"Read. This. Book. I have heard about this book for so long and had been waiting to read it with no excuse as to why I waited as long as I did. This is one of the most rewarding and life changing books a person can read. It changes your perspective based off of introducing the viewpoint that success is dictated not only by a person's hard labor, but by the opportunities that they are given in their youth. It also revolutionizes this perspective by introducing social constructs in the importance of cultural differences. It has aided me in empathetic leadership, becoming a better manager, and becoming a better person.",2019-01-19,
7334,1,Very Interesting and Insightful. I really enjoyed this book and looking at success from a new perspective. I enjoy Gladwell’s writing style.,2019-01-18,
7335,1,"Success facts, stories and insights that inspire!. I like the way Gladwell narrated success stories and digging deep into the background and historical side of it. The success stories he shared and its roots obviously make sense and nothing new- but making the detailed analysis of it convinces me that indeed taking advantage of the opportunity in front of us is the only way to succeed.",2019-01-17,
7336,1,"LOVED this book!. Take what you know about being successful and tip it on its side. You will learn that although elbow grease is an important tool, circumstances outside of your control may be more responsible for your ultimate destiny than you ever thought possible. Fascinating and expertly narrated by the author. I highly recommend it to everyone of every age!",2019-01-16,

7343,1,"Lack of a full tie-in. The stories through this book were great and very informative; however, the author only did a roughly 5 minute tie-in at the end of the book showing how all of the stories stated previously in the book come together. Instead of going into mass amounts of detail per story (although they were intriguing) I feel like there should’ve been more time devoted to describing what the book is about, rather than what the stories were about.",2019-01-06,

7345,1,Brilliant. This story really helped put all the factors that going into success in perspective! Great read and really empowering!,2019-01-03,
7346,1,Powerful. I think this book may be a game changer for me. Not in any obvious or spectacular way but it certainly has given me a different way to look at the world. It’s not that the information is new but it’s the kind of stories that you’ve always heard or thought you’ve heard but just didn’t have the words or the back story to put it all together in your thoughts. It gives a clear space to see these stories through.,2019-01-03,
7347,1,"Loved it.... Malcolm Gladwell provides me with a new way of thinking about life and success. It would be great if we, society, adopted parts of this book to change the way we look at why things happened and the deeper cultural impact of why people are successful — maybe we could help change the outcomes for students and other people, who try as they might never achieve the success that they are capable of enjoying. I have always believed that access and opportunity change things and this book has confirmed my beliefs.",2019-01-02,

7353,1,"Thought provoking. The main thesis of the book is interesting and thought provoking. There are, I believe, many other factors to consider regarding what makes an Outlier the successful person they are. Environment, and opportunities for growth and development are crucial, that is true. I would also give ample credit to the Outlier's ability to be causative in their environment, and to find or even create opportunities for themselves. All of these factors and more will cumulatively create the outcome. A great book for a book club discussion!",2018-12-29,

7355,1,"Analysis of the obvious?. At the risk of tempering all these glowing reviews, while interesting for a time, Outliers dragged into the quagmire of coincidence by the middle of the listen. Many of Gladwell's claims of the cause for Outliers can be easily dismissed by time/place/circumstances increasing the chances of the analyzed event occurring. When the book headed off into the weed of behavior analysis, I became completely detached and tuned out. I guess my tepid review is the outlier, but be careful with you expectations of a great listen...it was not.",2018-12-28,

7358,1,"A question of generalize what is learned. This book is very good and brings a new perspective towards our vision regarding successful people. However, it feels like it is forcing too much its vision because of a intrinsic limitation: it does not have the time or space to analyze every case of success in every area. So the book simply brings us a paradigm that we may believe it and search for ourselves, or not.",2018-12-21,

It doesn't soothe people's excuses... does disprove preconceived ideas and biases... makes you look at the bigger picture of success...

7407,1,"Great Insight into Success. Gladwell's paints a picture to describe success that follows a different narrative than the traditional tale.  There are some fascinating conclusions about the impact of environment.  With that said, I think he dismisses, personal vision and the extent to which some people maximize their opportunities versus others. The people in his narrative fully explored/exploited those opportunities, but dismissing missed opportunities is careless.  Its just impossible to write a book about the innovations unrealized from the lack of vision or persistence because we never have the innovation to marvel upon.  Instead we can only deconstruct the product of the extreme success.  His points on cultural legacy seem very good.  Great read!",2018-11-02,

However, it sometimes seems a bit of «cherry picking» when Gladwelltend to mostly tell us what fits his view. It’s not to be read as facts, but as something to be added to a much bigger debate. Gladwell mostly argues that opportunities and hard work are the main engredients to success. But he doesn’t really talk much about «grabbing» the opportunities that is in front of you, or creating opportunities out of what seems to not be one to others. He explores it a bit when talking about the different cultural glasses people view the world with, so not completely taking it away from him.",2018-08-29,

I thought it'd be a self-help type of book but it wasn't at all, though I do feel a little better knowing some reasons about how successful people came to be successful.

This book though, made me keep wanting to hear the next story or the next part of the book. It was interesting to see how all the outliers mentioned in the book, made their way in the world. Along with that though, it makes you think to yourself, ""how can I find my opportunity and maximize it to the fullest potential?""

Great anecdotes and insights, but the book doesn’t bother to tie these findings about circumstance back to the central theme of becoming a successful person or “outlier” yourself, which I assume is its mission. For some I imagine it would actually achieve the opposite goal, an existential fear of always being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” through its extreme determinist viewpoint.

He has a knack for discussing commonly held ideas, and reassessing they way that those ideas were formed. In this particular work, Gladwell takes on the idea of success and what makes the ultra-successful who they are. He particularly addresses the idea of the ""self-made man"" and how the ultra-successful are actually products of their particular time and place just as much products of their own talents. The way that Malcolm Gladwell frames his arguments is very compelling, and the fact that you get the pleasure of listening to him read his own work is an added bonus.",2018-08-07,

In this book Outlier is only on the success side as the term Outlier can easily be used to define extreme success but I also appreciate how he touched on the other end of the spectrum as well (catastrophic failure). The simple synopsis of this book is that a successful Outlier is not a self made man only but also needs a few lucky circumstances, ethnicity, genetics, family background and breaks to become an Outlier.It all makes sense.

You can't get anywhere without hard work, but you also can't get anywhere if your surroundings are working against you. I tend to like Gladwell's sweeping explanations, but at the end he brings it down to a more personal level, which I think helps the reader/listener understand his theory on a micro scale.",2018-07-12,

So to say Gates and all those who are outliers are not responsible for their achievements is false. They maybe outliers because of unique opportunities but they are also outliers because of their rugged individualism and hard work. What nation has rugged individualists and hard work as their core? The USA. What nation has forever changed the world for the improvement of all man kind because of the enormous amount of outliers we produce? The USA.

7526,1,"a fair attempt to simplify something complex. This book attempts to explain how those considered outliers achieve fantastic success. The cultural background, date of birth and opportunities at work, wealth and parenting types. He does a great job explaining the importance of all of these things but frankly over simplifies and boils success down to almost only these things. He refers to "" individual ruggedness"" as dangerous and discounts individual performance and success to a community effort. He makes some very good points but he simply points out why the ""outliers"" the Bill Gates of the world succeeded because of there time, place, and opportunities combined with his hard work to become something fantastic. His theory does not explain how most of us non outliers can be successful given very similar circumstances.  In short this book is an oversimplification of a very small group of people.",2018-05-14,

I was hoping for advice on becoming, or nurturing traits of outliers in employees, children, or ourselves.

I wish I would have understood this as a child and tried harder in academics.",2018-04-21,

Though Malcolm Gladwell clearly points out the advantages of right timing and societal advantages, one refrain remains constant and that is the willingness of those Outliers to work really hard. The example between high IQ and ""applied"" high IQ paints a telling picture. If you've read Jim Collins' Good to Great, Outliers will come as a worthy sequel that ties it all together and propels this quantitative analysis further ahead.",2018-03-26,

My hope is that the ideas in this book take hold in Western culture, that we as a society begin to see the individual does not pull themselves up by the bootstraps, rather a series of fortunate events including--but not limited to--opportunity, ability, and willingness to do hard work lead to success. The opportunities so many are denied helps the reader realize that there is really no such thing as an ""outlier"" as an individual phenomenon, rather the community and conditions set the stage to catapult someone outside the norm.",2018-01-18,

It is still the individual that has to capitalize on the opportunities that are present.",2017-11-07,

Many of the outliers discussed in his narratives are just the people I, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur feeling defeated by time, have scrutinized I search of an explanation. Reading their biographies, the explanation is right there. Being shaped myself but our individualistic Western culture I was blind to the answers before me until Gladwell happily shown a light on the truest explanation. Of course these are great people with a lot of talent and potential and good work ethic, but that's only a sliver of the explanation. It's also inspiring to realize that I'm faced daily with opportunities to become an outlier. I just have to keep an open mind.",2017-10-02,
7667,1,"Great subject. Powerful examples.. Very good subject, I am fully aligned with the core assertion that all of us are primarily result of circumstances and opportunities we get in life, but the author's treatment of this assertion neglects to highlight a core idea, that making the most of an opportunity is the responsibility of an individual. Talented or not, one must have the ability to persevere in order to succeed. Making relevant personal choices in a timely manner and being willing to pay the price for reaching a goal is as central to the idea of success as opportunity is. Foresight and conviction, open-mindedness and intrinsic drive, optimism and patience are all such traits that make a successful individual. Nature of an individual who just doesn't give a damn will always overpower the nurturing received from a caring set of parents or community that believes in them and wishes to invest in them. We can't just claim that an older sibling ends up more successful because they received the undivided attention of parents. That by definition would make older siblings more successful in a statistically significant way. However, that's not what we see. Even innate talent is useful for a person who doesn't show the aforementioned traits and an attitude for self-correction and life long learning.",2017-09-30,

7678,1,"Work, blessings, luck. Highly recommend this book. Lessons of hard work and gratitude for ""Blessings,/ Tender mercies from God"" or coincidence. We can help promote opportunities. However, there is a bit too much emphasis on the collective and a missed opportunity to describe how an environment of societal liberty and limited government intervention promotes innovation by individuals. A story that could have been told is the amazing ""coincidence"" of the framers of the US Constitution who were born at the right place and time and with opportunity to learn about government. They formed a totally new idea about individual liberty and controlling tyranny for maximum prosperity.",2017-09-13,

7688,1,"Insightful and Engaging Read. Incredible book. My favorite among Gladwells works. The insights seem so commonse, yet are often rejected by a social narrative around self made people. If anything, Outliers outlines and forcefully makes the case that luck and timing have as much to do with our individual successes as hard work and dedication. Not that those virtues dont matter - they do - but it is when they are combined with things outside our control that we see incredible people emerge. In a more subtle way the book is also a condemnation on societys failure to give more children the opportunities that a select few have been given. The author rhetorically asks, ""how many more Bill Gates would we have had if a million teenagers had been given the same opportunities as him?"" Its reminiscent of Bobby Kennedys often quoted line: ""Some men see things as they are and ask why? I dream things that never were and ask why not?"" Do yourself a favor and read/listen to this book!",2017-08-27,
7689,1,"Lots of Liberal BS to sift, but still a must read!. There is a fair amount of liberal thinking garbage in the book that I had to cringe through, but if you keep an open eye to the deeper point of the book and take from it the facts to expand your mind, the book becomes a must read. In the end the message I decide to take and partly the message the author gives is, that we all for the most part live in a situation or world with unlimited possibilities. Yes some people had it a little easier, but ultimately your hard work and dedication to something will result in your success. Recognize your place and time in life and try to identify the leg up that's been offered to you. Exploit that through hard work and be a success!",2017-08-25,

The author leans heavily on circumstance as the only creator of outliers and while I certainly understand his point of view, the efforts of the individuals to identify and act upon opportunity when it was presented seemed equally important and in some cases more so. You could sum up the whole argument as a chicken and the egg scenario and in the end, both were required to create and outlier or chicken.",2017-03-24,

7767,1,Awesome perspective shift.. I love this book. Really helps you to see and think of things in a different way.,2017-03-19,
7768,1,Great Book. This book is an excellent look into human success and what is required to reach that success. The book was not written with this purpose in mind (I don't think) but I can't help but feel like this should be required reading / listening for new parents who want to have successful off spring.,2017-03-15,

7773,0,"Defies classification.. Overall this book is quite interesting. My disappointment however, lies in the fact that I'm not quite sure I learned anything of value from its contents. Perhaps if you are a sociologist, or you just generally enjoy statistical information, this book may be for you.",2017-03-07,
7774,1,"A little anecdotal in sections. I love books that leave me with ideas that I can ponder on and this book did just that. The 3 elements of occupational success and the 10,000 hour rule are two examples found in this book. It was worth a credit. Narration was substandard but not so much as to be distracting from the content.",2017-03-06,
7775,1,"One of its kind. The book was recommended to me by a good colleague since she saw my aptitude for early childhood experiences that in my opinion not only shape our ego but also our vision and purpose in life. For me it was clear that next to the intelligence given to us these experiences matter most. Being born and raised between two cultures I could also conclude the importance of culture, beliefs and tradition to the education and early childhood experiences. Which I totally left out in my view of success was pure opportunity and LUCK. That is so beautiful that it hurts that Bill Gates and Stave Jobs - great minds and leaders without a doubt - are creations of 'being at the right time at the right place.",2017-03-03,

7779,1,Relatable and Interesting. I enjoyed this book. The author's cadence is perfect. He ties his pointed neatly together and it's very easy to follow. I love his references to diversity and how interconnected we are. Listening to him felt like we were having a beautiful conversation with interesting stories. I ended up ordering his other books and I'm going through them one at a time.,2017-03-01,

7787,1,"To understand fortune is to be grateful. This is a book for all to read. Malcolm Gladwell has spotted the tip of the iceberg.

7791,1,Mind blowing. The narrator was very pleasant to listen to. The examples and research was fascinating and illuminating. I learned a lot from this read.,2017-02-13,
7792,1,"Focus is Necessary. Malcolm Gladwell is a modern day genius. His research is impeccable and his presentation, moving. The amount of information placed in each chapter is substantial and there are multiple different stories included in each chapter to paint an image of the principal presented. The variety of stories, from well known celebrities to lesser-known communities, adds a three-dimensional texture to the overwhelming truth of the substance shared. I continually felt ideas and inspirations that I wanted to implement in my life or in my children's lives that could help set one up for success. Gladwell does not hold back from his message he wants to convey, rather, he tells it as it is and avoids any mitigation, which he discusses later in the book. The layout of the book is revelatory. Everything links together and leads to an ultimate story, which I shan't revel to save the surprise for potential readers/listeners. I love this book. This writing is very applicable to all. I hope you can use it in your life like I plan to and mine.",2017-02-11,
7793,1,"Excellent. This book really makes you think, it also drives home the point that with hard work and the right circumstances anyone can be exceptional. Success comes from your drive but also from those around you and how you were raised. It was a great listen!",2017-02-10,
7794,1,Wonderful and enlightening. I learned new concept. Very engaging. Really ties things together and forces you to re think success. Finished in 1 week.,2017-02-10,
7795,1,"Redundant. Most of it is common sense. Makes a lot of analogies to back up a point that no one really argued with. He has good points, but 99% of the book is telling stories of people that fit his point, instead of actually talking about the point. This book could have had a lot more content than it did.",2017-02-09,
7796,1,"Love the new perspective on success. Great read/listen. I listened during my commutes in the morning and loved the lessons in the book. I also enjoyed when Gladwell would continually reference old chapters, it helped with retention of information.",2017-02-07,

7802,1,"Fantastic histo-sociological look at patterns. I loved this book for a number of reasons. As a ""middle class,"" white, female millennial on the older end of the generation, I wish everyone would read this book. I have worked really hard, but conditions have not been ""just right"" for me to make a livable wage until less than a year ago.

7807,1,"Revelation. I really loved it and the fact that Gladwell narated the audiobook. I really recommend this for all students, just because I currently am and it has opened my eyes to seek out for as many opportunities and seize them, through working hard, not waisting that opportunity and trading off of bad habits. These opportunities and how I seize them really will determine where I am 5-10 years from now, and the impact I'll have in the next generations, starting with my future kids.",2017-01-19,

7809,1,"good read, listen critically. very interesting, though I think the author underemphasized the importance of innate talent, intelligence and hard work in the success stories in some cases in order to improve the prominence of his book's purpose. listen to the interview at the end, it adds to one's understanding of the author's perspective.",2017-01-17,
7810,1,"Great education as always from Gladwell. The book breaks down many facets of life and learning. Although hard work is necessary for defined success, timing is paramount. Support is built for both cases in an easy to follow format.",2017-01-16,

For me this book was profoundly personal and motivating.",2017-01-13,

Shattering my former notion of success through the talent, hard work, and opportunity as the holy trinity or ""formula"" that propels individuals to profound accomplishment.

The implications of this message would have profound consequences for the way we organize ourselves as humanity and I think the more people that know about these principles the more prosperous and successful a world we could all build.",2017-01-06,

His ability to weave the stories and the biographies of successful people into a thoughtful analysis about the elements that will create success or failure is insightful .  I will rad this book again because it requires several readings and reflection to truly appreciate the many themes and information that Malcolm Gladwell developed and shared in this narrative. I especially enjoyed the  reference to Jamaica and the success and failure of family members born in Jamaica and the elements that supported their growth and achievement.  This is a great book to use with young adults for reading and discussion as they begin their journey into adulthood. This can be a meaningful reminder to all that success is dependent on many factors and that being aware of that will provide the humility to understand that we are not successful because of ourselves alone, but indeed we owe much to the generation and the ancestors and the time of our birth and on and on.",2016-08-29,

Still good findings though.",2016-08-12,
7888,1,"Learn what makes success-Really. Wonderful book full of clear view on who succeeds and why that happens. Clear indications for education, parenting, and personal choices. I highly recommend this book!",2016-08-06,
7889,1,Mind blown. I have 2 small children (born n August...yes) and it really is inspiring and a great new perspective on how to help direct them to success while there is still time. Love it,2016-08-04,
7890,1,"Inspring. It's truly amazing to learn how to see success from a fresh perspective , and this perspective can empower individual to figure a new way of HOW to achieve one's own success .",2016-08-01,
7891,1,"Thought provoking. I enjoyed hearing the author read his book about interesting and compelling considerations as to why people and businesses are successful. This book is somewhat drawn out and redundant, however, the author makes his point of view clear.",2016-08-01,

7895,1,Did not meet my expectations. I've expected more from the book based on what people say about it.,2016-07-27,
7896,0,Practical application missing.... It was a great start. The individual stories were great but in the middle it starts dragging all the way to the end.,2016-07-26,
7897,1,great book. very nicely presented data. loved it. the book opens your eyes to the reality of how success isn't always under your control,2016-07-25,
7898,1,Interesting perspective. I enjoyed the book overall. I liked the different perspective explaining ideas leading to success. The book was well written and read.  I didn't give 5 stars due to a lack of content. I hoped there would be more information and research done. It lays out a clear cause for outliers but I just wanted much more information.,2016-07-25,
7899,1,"Sensational. it tells nothing happens by chance, esp. outstanding outliers, which is combination of all the different sources.",2016-07-21,
7900,1,Amazing. I really enjoyed this book on my way to work everyday. Insightful and interesting. Consider increasing the speed if you find that its's read too slowly as I did.,2016-07-19,
7901,1,Solid book. Life (and success therein) is a product not only of our own hard work but also of the circumstances we are bestowed with and experiences we have throughout.,2016-07-17,
7902,0,"Don't waste your time or money. The story begins by eluding to possible ways where you (reader) might also become an ""Outlier"" but every example and story reverts to the same basic premise - ""You won't find greatness without advantages beyond your own merits"", ""those who were fortunate enough to be born in the months January, February, and March are the only ones who could achieve the Outlier status"", ""all advantages in life just HAPPEN to fall into place for the selected elite.""",2016-07-11,

7906,1,This book decodes our world. Every chapter delivers insight into why we are where we are by examining the most successful of us. it's comforting to know why we succeed and to what and whom we owe our particular opportunities. I'm about to listen to this again. an amazing book!,2016-07-09,
7907,1,very good. This was an incredible book. Not dry or uninteresting at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it and actually learned alot.,2016-07-09,
7908,0,Bad reasoning. Authors conclusions are too simple and not evidence based. The fact that some one has the right opportunities doesn't mean that's the sole reason for their success.,2016-07-08,
7909,1,fascinating. I finished it in one day. it's a very unique and refreshing perspective. I highly recommend it.,2016-07-08,
7910,1,"Profound. Very insightful and inciting.. Very good book. I think some readers might consider it boring till they read for a while. once you get in groove that his seemingly over- developed stories are going ro lead to something amazing, you can't wait to get to the next one.",2016-07-08,
7911,1,Eye opening. The best book I've heard ! Hands down its REALLY GOOD! I enjoyed it very much and now I'm going to go get another gladwell book,2016-07-04,
7912,1,globalized perspective. Great look on how historical circumstances create modern society and how those circumstances also create an outlier.,2016-07-04,
7913,1,"Wholeheartedly Disagree. The whole premise of this book is to convince the reader that successful people such as Bill Gates and the Beatles were more products of fortunate situations and less of their own doing, which is total whiny socialist b.s., and anecdotal at best. What about the rest of us?",2016-07-04,
7914,1,The book was way more interesting than I originall. I rather enjoyed the book. I found it to be intriguing how the lives of others were changed by circumstances.,2016-07-01,

7917,1,Awesome!. I listened to the audio book twice it was so good. I highly recommend this.,2016-06-14,
7918,1,"Eyeopener. The stories within this book brings affirmation to the notion of ""leg up"" in society, and has brought greater self-awareness to misfortunes and fortunes of opportunity and advantage.",2016-06-14,
7919,1,"Very engaging! Hooked after the 1st chapter. Does an excellent job of walking through countless examples in modern history of the unique events that fostered the breeding grounds for today's ""outliers"" and argues that intelligence alone isn't enough to guarantee success, but a combination of hard work, opportunity, cultural tradition, and in some cases luck or happenstance is what it takes.",2016-06-13,
7920,1,Excellent book. Excellent narration by Malcom Gladwell. I enjoyed the different stories used in the book and enjoyed as well the logic Malcom used as he describe each Outlier case.,2016-06-12,
7921,1,"Very interesting short audiobook.. The book is very interesting, and the narrator does a phenomenal job. It's a very compelling book and it keeps you intrigued throughout.",2016-06-08,
7922,1,"a great book. i loved the book and the conclusions it presents. many often we accept the hand that we are dealt. though this book doesn't present Outliers that went against the tide, I'd like to think that this knowledge can turn some of us Outliers, by going against the tide.",2016-06-08,
7923,1,"Second read. engrossing, cross-referenced, and  wholly persuasive. I have recommended this book, just like it came to me",2016-06-01,
7924,1,Very intresting book!. Loved the book! although I disagreed with some parts I thought it was an eye opening book.,2016-05-31,
7925,1,"Expanded my worldview. Fascinating book. It's almost impossible to comprehend all the factors that contribute to peoples' success or lack there of. He makes sure to point out that dedication and hard work are necessary, but not always sufficient factors. Can't wait to read more of Gladwell",2016-05-27,
7926,1,Loved it!. Fascinating stories I've never heard before...I read it months ago and it resonates for a long time. I find myself thinking of the interesting tidbits in this book all the time.,2016-05-27,
7927,1,"Thought-provoking. This book reminded me quite a bit of David and Goliath, which is the first Gladwell book I read. Sometimes the conclusions feel oversimplified or even far-fetched, but the book certainly is though-provoking. I enjoyed it especially because the stories made me reflect on my own life, legacy and community so I could more clearly see why I am who I am and where I am going.",2016-05-27,
7928,1,Excellent. Great insight into how success is as much luck or circumstances as any thing else,2016-05-25,
7929,1,"Very insightful. Interesting, profound, dot connecting at its pinnacle. Provides understanding and evolution of success. Very enjoyable",2016-05-24,
7930,1,Interesting read. this book provides an interesting perspective regarding the subject of how people that our society deems successful obtains their success.,2016-05-21,
7931,1,A rewarding challenge to conventional wisdom. A well-written and narrated book with a message that America desperately needs to hear. Listening to this book is a good step toward enlightenment.,2016-05-20,
7932,1,"not as good as the tipping point. book was OK but it amounts to ""practice makes perfect"". not as interesting as the tipping point.",2016-05-18,
7933,1,"Brilliant research, biased conclusion. What a wonderful compilation of research, filled with psychological and sociological truths, and presented in a way that yields understanding of complex topics.

7935,1,"Sad Allegory. As an American, I truly prefer a tale which is much less serendipitous. This is a perspective from entitled, elitist.... there is some truth... and ancestry provided advantages..... but discouraging synopsis for anyone midlife.",2016-05-01,
7936,1,"Interesting but not a must read!. It's an interesting and well write book and the audio version is well done. However, it solely focused on the circumstance of what led successful people to become who they are without almost no regards to their efforts and perseverance.",2016-04-29,
7937,1,interesting. nice read. interesting stories that come up with conclusions I would like to continue to look into myself. I feel like a bad person for saying that the epilogue about his family was the least interesting part of the book.,2016-04-25,
7938,1,The book shows that anyone can be a success.. I loved how the writer broke down all the elements that contributed to the success of some of our greatest men and women. You could put yourself into the category and understand given the same life circumstances you to could have been a success.,2016-04-24,
7939,1,"loved it. sent copies of the book to my family.. loved it,sent copies of the book to my6 family. Reading all of the authors books.",2016-04-24,

7941,1,Must read. One of the best books I have ever read. Loved each and every chapter of it.,2016-04-18,
7942,1,A Must listen book. Complex ideas explained clear with examples that are easily memorable so that enlighted topics last in mind.,2016-04-18,
7943,1,"Makes you think, but a little pseudosciencey. Well researched, written and narrated. I would've liked to see an attempt to predict what future outliers will look like and a reflection on how to use this info to modify the current system.",2016-04-17,
7944,1,"So much insight!. Wow! Such a quich read, but so much thoughful, pertinent, temporal insight. It makes one reassess one's life story. A must read.",2016-04-15,
7945,1,Inspiring book. Easy to listen. Ideas are persuasive and well supported with examples. I enyojed the book and will repeat some parts to think them through again.,2016-04-14,
7946,1,Right on!. Confirms what we knew in a humble and intelligent manner. Every chapter was fascinating. The only thing missing is a recognition that success is not only a result of right time-right place opportunity but also of individual savvy and motivation/energy. I don't think the success of one exists without either: 1) community/culture/opportunity and 2) the individual's ability to identify and motivation to pursue the opportunity.,2016-04-13,
7947,1,Extremely Insightful. You will realize why the people that are successful are successful. Amazing story and amazing detail about how those outliers that we all know came to be.,2016-04-11,
7948,1,Eye opening and Uplifting in the most real of ways. Mr. Gladwell does an amazing job of presenting and guiding you through a new way of looking at success and hard work. I remained deeply invested through the entire book.,2016-04-08,
7949,1,Amazing book. This book basically change everything you know about success and how to be fully prepared for things. It tells you that success is a combination of two things: Opportunity and Skills when they meet at the right time the outcome must be a success.,2016-04-02,

7955,1,Even better read the second time around!. The topics contained in this book is very interesting and thought provoking! Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for investing the time and research to create and accomplish this vision.,2016-03-23,
7956,0,"This review was just a coincidence. I didn't like the theory presented. I agree with a little bit of it, the hard work and practice, but the rest is not what I wanted to learn.",2016-03-20,
7957,1,Successful people need 10k hrs. To become a master of anything you need to do the hard work of doing 10k hrs in your chosen skills/abilities/sports. Do this and you can change into that person you desire to become.,2016-03-17,
7958,1,"Interesting. I liked the fun facts and correlations presented. I'm not sure how you really wrap a book like that up, so the ending was weird. If it wasn't for his exit interview and the all encompassing title the irony at the end would of been lost. I would recommend to someone else.",2016-03-17,
7959,1,"Influential!. The second most influential book I've been exposed to, behind the bible.",2016-03-15,
7960,0,Good insight but very boring. The insight was interesting but I found that this was just an exposition into different lives and jumped around too much. There was very little story or anything to keep me entertained and I had to force myself to finish this book.,2016-03-13,
7961,1,"Gives you a new perspective. Yes, the book gives you a new way to look at success; however, the most noteworyhy is the way he makes you revisit the way we (should) approach ""matters"", in general.",2016-03-12,
7962,1,Outstanding book. It is very common in our society to cite certain people as being exceptional… But the author paints is a picture of how being in the right place at the right time can make all of the different. The author reads the book himself which I believe is the best scenario as you get the proper emphasis that was intended.,2016-03-12,
7963,1,Fantastic stories mixed with stats. I couldn't stop listening. The author used real data and physical proof to illustrate that the outliers (self made millionaires) are not self made at all. His correlations are not used to express the cause of a person's success.,2016-03-11,
7964,1,"Excelente narración, el mejor de Gladwell. Hasta ahora, el mejor. Y eso que los otros que he leído de él son excelentes. Muy recomendado. Muy sincero y personal.",2016-03-10,

7966,1,"Something to marinate with. The book really forces you to look at the antecedents for people and cultures today. Malcolm applies science rather than some far fetched possibilities for success and failure. I will let this marinate so that I can pick up on some of my own views that may be holding me back, although he doesn't elaborate on this in the book, I wasn't expecting him to. Definitely worth the price of admission.",2016-03-01,
7967,1,Amazing!. Amazing book. Couldn't listen fast enough! Wish I would have came across it sooner. Looking forward to more from Malcolm Gladwell.,2016-02-29,

7971,1,Timely and most excellent!. Thank you for the audio version of this book! Without it would have not have the time to intake this collection of valuable research data and wisdom by which the author put his views forth . Thank you from the bottom of my heart!,2016-02-17,
7972,1,Very interesting and I loved this whole idea. this book was incredible and really opened my eyes to how much chance and opportunity shapes your life.,2016-02-17,
7973,1,You will re-think your definition of success.. I loved this book. I love how the author explores many common notions about success and helps the reader to seriously re-think what he or she knows or thinks they know about what makes extraordinary people extraordinary.,2016-02-06,
7974,1,"Thought-provoking and important for our time.. I have enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's ideas since I first heard him speak on WNYC's ""Radiolab"" program. I decided to read his book ""Outliers"" to further satiate that curiosity.",2016-01-28,
7975,1,"GREAT BOOK ON SUCCESS. Success and in general, human behaviour, is not an isolated incident. Malcolm goes to such great extent to explain how different circumstances had to be in place in order for a specific outcome to be achieved. Some of these are deliberate while others are unavoidable.",2016-01-24,
7976,1,Thought-provoking and captivating. The author does a phenomenal job of presenting facts and studies on individuals success and failure. I highly recommend this audiobook,2016-01-20,
7977,1,Great book!! Insightful and interesting!!. Gave me a better understanding of success and how better to provide my own kids with opportunity and what it can do for them!! I wish I read this when they were much younger!!,2016-01-18,
7978,1,"Insightful, logical, but missing some information. This book was very interesting and kept me engaged with insightful stories until the end. There is a pretty significant error in the middle of the book where the author concludes that since Nobel Prize winners are represented by all IQ levels equally above 120, that enabling a larger number of moderately intelligent people into top colleges (all other variables constant) would cause a higher number of intelligent people to produce Nobel worthy accomplishments. This conclusion does not take into consideration the fact that there are a much higher quantities of people with average to marginally above average intelligence than there are brilliant.",2016-01-11,
7979,1,worth the listen if you like social science. fascinating series of stories that essentially state your circumstance + opportunities to practice are what make for outstanding examples of human performance. Gladwell does a great job presenting here.,2015-12-30,
7980,1,"Will Smith brought me here. I initially read this book because of Will Smith. This book started off rough for me because I felt bombarding by stats. I soon began to see that Gladwell was proven his theory. Although, I found the research amazing and valuable I wasn't sure what (I) should do with it. Until the very end where he brings it all full circle and that's my only criticism. I wish the utility of the information given was stated sooner. Still a great book.",2015-12-26,
7981,0,"this book tells us that we all have equal talents. this book heavily discredits innate ability and genetics. 10,000 hours of practice is heavily flawed. I will not recommend this book.",2015-12-24,
7982,1,"Too many words. Malcolm has a couple of new ideas and several rehashed old ones. The concept of statistical evaluation and examination of factor confluence is important and useful, he spends too many words repeating the same information without further illumination.",2015-12-23,
7983,1,"Five Stars. Malcom Gladwell is a fantastic writer who makes a variety of concepts accessible for an audience with it without a scientific background. Outliers is an inspiring book, that is both fanatic to read, and have read to you. I am particularly fond of Malcom Gladwell's audio books as he reads them himself, instead of a different narrator.",2015-12-17,
7984,1,"Fascinating read with minor flaws. I seem to agree with Gladwell with the conclusion he makes. The arguments are sound but they do look to be cherry picked at times. This was probably the main flaw for me, and some people also tend to be highly critical of the book for this reason. It also seems to be repetitive at times. Again, these are only very minor flaws in otherwise excellent book. But still a very fascinating read and presents alternative perspective. Very easy to read, probably a must read for most people.",2015-12-12,
7985,1,"Amazing!!. I loved this book. I highly recommend it, worth reading for sure. Great narration by the author as well.",2015-12-09,

7988,1,"Are we doomed to mediocrity?. Having completed the fascinating and awe-inspiring summary of Mr Gladwell's research, I verge on extreme depression thinking that if we are not outliers the rest of us are doomed to mediocrity. Without 10,000 hours of experience, we are merely ""also-rans"". Thus, I will continue to focus on being thankful to be running at all.",2015-12-05,
7989,1,Humanistic. It was very interesting and the author did a lot of research. It's just plagued with humanistic presuppositions.,2015-12-03,
7990,1,Must read. This book will add new perspective to your life. It will let you see things from a new side.,2015-11-30,
7991,1,Fantastic book. I loved it. The way he shows how circumstances shaped the lives of succeeded people is amazing.,2015-11-24,
7992,1,Great book!. I like how he changed my views on the outliers. It somehow gives hope to people who also wants to be successful and persuade them to grab every opportunities available to them.,2015-11-19,
7993,1,"Wonderful, insightful, look into people.. I enjoyed the message of we are all a product of nature and nurture. Without someone's innate gift they don't become the rock star, or the internet tycoon. But at the same time without the world around us giving us opportunity, these wonders these Outlyers would never have been.",2015-11-18,
7994,1,As a Jamaican. Reading this book and seeing him get every point right I know he doesn't just research but he digs deep for true honest facts. One of the worlds best authors.,2015-11-15,
7995,1,Great first audiobook experience. Loved Malcolm Gladwell's storytelling ability. The ideas he discusses are well thought out and simplistic enough that one can draw parallels to their own life. I really liked how I could listen on a higher speed without the language being distorted too much. Would recommend to all.,2015-11-11,

8001,1,Great Book. I like this book a lot it was very informative much like most of Malcolm Gladwell's books.,2015-10-17,
8002,1,"I love his approach and conclusions. The author takes the common perception of success and analyzes it and comes up with a wholly new conclusion of how to achieve it. He uses very interesting real life examples, however, it was a little bit boring when he talked about plane crashes. But, that was only until I understood what he wanted to explain about it.",2015-10-15,
8003,1,"Gladwell is a Fabulous Narrator. The outlier theory is fascinating, and I appreciate the knowledge I gained from each and every story, but a few were a bit lengthy. Gladwell's voice, however, is smooth like jazz, soothing like a hot bath. I swear it was like one long massage for my ears. I could listen to him talk forever....",2015-10-13,
8004,1,"Awesome. Great book. It does much to explain how great people became great. It would be interesting to see a book take what was learned through this study and apply it to basic psychology so that individuals could be empowered to rise above their less than optimal circumstances. The only downside of this audio book, for me, was the cadence with which it was read. I needed to speed it up to at least 1.5 speed in order to keep my focus. Otherwise, very fascinating!",2015-10-08,
8005,1,"great read.... We hear a lot about how people are ""gifted or ""born geniuses"". Malcolm Gladwell challenges this notion with some stellar (unexpected) real life examples. The book is a very easy listen and will strongly challenge if not completely change the way you view success and the world as a whole!",2015-10-02,
8006,1,Very interesting. I really love topics that explain possible reasons for behavioral/social outcomes. I've always been interested in psychology but sometimes it's interesting to hear about non-abnormal psych topics. This covers topics that can be considered abnormal but mostly abnormal in the good way - extraordinary people.,2015-09-27,

8012,1,The Best. One if the best books I have ever heard. If you like the psychology and social economic story's of success you will love this book.,2015-09-06,
8013,1,"Thought provoking. I think the author is over emphasizing the role of luck. While he makes a compelling case with great anecdotal evidence, I think classifying people like Bill Gates our Steve Jobs as ordinary people presented with extraordinary opportunities is not giving due credit to what makes these outliers such super achievers.",2015-09-05,
8014,1,"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable. Plus it gets the reader thinking about what causes success and makes an argument that is not often expressed outright - basically no man is an island and no one is a truly self-made man. Lots of great examples throughout the book to support the argument.",2015-09-01,
8015,0,Long winded. The first few chapters were very interesting. The latter part of the book seemed to cover the same or similar topic in each chapter. The stories and explanations of the relationship of culture and environment to success grew tiresome toward the end.,2015-08-31,
8016,1,Listen Carefully Malcolm Gladwell did his homework. It's not a novel so don't expect the highs and lows of your typical novels.,2015-08-30,
8017,1,I am not going to lie: it’s outstanding!. There are many truths not known by the general public in this book. This book changes the way you see circumstances and devotion.,2015-08-25,
8018,0,"Interesting research, garbage conclusions. A lot of the research Gladwell did was interesting and there are things to be learned from it. But the conclusions he comes to make huge assumptions and ignore the facts that don't fit his views. It was a very frustrating listen, like arguing with someone making terrible points but not being able to respond.",2015-08-24,
8019,1,awesome and inspiring.. will definitely be listening to this audio book again.,2015-08-17,
8020,1,"Fascinating!. A great study on the ""self made man!""",2015-08-10,
8021,1,"A must read for everyone.. A terrific combination of storytelling and research. Gladwell explains how to level the playing field through individual opportunity. Being given a chance and then working hard at that chance, is what everyone needs to improve their social standing. Luck and timing are the primary ingredients required to create outliers.",2015-08-09,
8022,1,"Kids: do not be discouraged. Just work hard.. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell shows the intriguing correlation between culture (many generations back), opportunity, and chance and the achievement of successful people. The author discusses Scottish herdsmen from the borderlands and the legacy that leaves with the (often mistakenly derided) honor among Southerners. He discusses generations of hard work by Chinese rice farmers and how that, plus basic constructs of their language, profoundly impact the math abilities of Asians today. As an individual, I appreciate more my (Scottish/Irish) tenant farmer heritage and the role that the ethos of hard work played in my own personal success. I also see how my early math geek experiences (mental math competitions) gave me an advantage in engineering school.",2015-08-06,
8023,1,"Should be required reading. A must read for anyone wondering what sets the ""lucky"" apart. You learn why, and how people have become more ""successful"" than yourself, and discover ways to close the gap and create outliers yourself.",2015-08-04,
8024,1,"Fascinating and contrarian. Gladwell is a great storyteller, and Outliers is both provocative and personal. If the book was read by anyone but the author (given its personal nature), it would have been less impactful.",2015-08-01,
8025,1,"Interesting for a quick read. My review must apparently have at least 15 unique words, oh look there we go.",2015-08-01,
8026,1,"Well argued, a view I held.. Well argued. I related given my rural black South African upbringing. Have seen over and over how environment shaped the citizens.",2015-08-01,
8027,1,"Great listen. I love listening to Malcolm Gladwell books for the same reasons most people do. At the risk of sounding picky or blind to the fact that this is a great book, I don't think it's Gladwell's best. The Tipping Point and David & Goliath both had an amazing stickiness for me, where it's been a over week since finishing this and haven't been thinking about it as much. I STILL think about The Tipping Point all the time.",2015-07-31,
8028,1,"Very fascinating. Many of the things that were in this book, I never considered and even if I had linked them, I would have thought they were coincidences. This book is an eye opener. I definitely recommend it.",2015-07-31,
8029,1,"Interesting perspective!. I preferred BLINK to this read, but OUTLIERS was still a good read in regards to a unique perspective as to why certain people are inherently successful. Give it a go!",2015-07-30,
8030,1,Great book!. What a great book! Really takes a deep look into the preconceived ideas of super special and extraordinary people.,2015-07-29,
8031,1,Insightful. This audible book helped me enjoy my chores and workout! Enjoyable read with great insights.,2015-07-29,
8032,1,"Compelling and well narrated. In addition to being a great writer and researcher, Malcolm Gladwell exceeded all my expectations as a narrator. I believe he is someone who goes the extra mile to ensure that the concepts in his work are articulated in a thought-provoking way. And excellent and worthy investment!",2015-07-28,
8033,1,"Insightful and engaging. One of few books that i cant stop once i started ! great for parents to be, social policy makers and reflection generally",2015-07-28,
8034,1,Thought provoking. Refreshing ideas which challenge the status quo image of success. The back story for each unique person discussed was very interesting and entertaining.,2015-07-27,
8035,1,It's all about hard work and mindset!. This book would be a great book for every person to read- it tackles the issue of entitlement and idealization- giving agency to every person and providing those who have both benefited and suffered from a system of entitlement an encouragement to continue to work hard and persevere.,2015-07-26,
8036,1,"Eye opening, an excellent book!. This book really brings out the meaning in some very interestimg statistics that you really wouldn't think we're related.",2015-07-23,
8037,1,"Great read!!. Great book!! Very informative, interesting and thought provoking. Malcolm Gladwell narrates very well. I'd recommend the book to anyone.",2015-07-22,

8041,1,amazingly written and performed. loved it. recommended for audible beginners. Malcom gives you a logical explanation on how successful got to be outliers. the examples given are beyond convincing. can't wait to read more of his works. it was also great that the author performed the book! !,2015-07-14,
8042,1,Great book.. One of the best books on success that I've ever read. Please read if you want to,2015-07-13,
8043,1,"Good start, sort of slows down.. Great book for the first 5 chapters. I though the ending was kind of slow, but that's only my opinion.",2015-07-13,
8044,1,"Well told stories that amuse and encourage. I very much enjoyed this book & learned a few things along the way. I would especially encourage high schoolers and young adults to read this book. There are many examples of success across a broad spectrum around the world and in the end, if you didn't already know, you'd will see that we all have the potential for success.",2015-07-07,
8045,1,"Exceptional, in depth read!. If you ever wonder how things work read any one of Malcolm's books, and you will be enlightened.",2015-07-05,
8046,1,New point of view on success. An awesome way of looking into people's success. Changed the way I look at how people(including me) achieve success in their careers.,2015-07-02,
8047,1,Love it!. Very insightful! Malcom Gladwell is a great Narrator. it caused me to think deeper.,2015-06-30,
8048,1,"The Brain Meets Opportunity. Gladwell offers a totally different way to view accomplishment. For most achievers, other variables play a huge role in the climb to the top.",2015-06-29,
8049,1,"Interesting philosophy. This book wasn't what I originally expected, however by the end it's definitely got my brain juices flowing and looking at the outliers around me. All around a good addition to my library.",2015-06-29,
8050,1,It was all I hoped it would be. I loved way this book and Malcolm make me look at things a little differently. Some of it made me sad and others happy. Over great listening to him read this book.,2015-06-27,
8051,1,"M.G.. Malcolm Gladwell's third piece ""Outliers"" is dually an example and assessment of quality, and how it comes to be.",2015-06-22,
8052,1,Interesting perspective about success.. Excellent perspective about success.. I took some time after listening the book.. identifying all the opportunities I had and which I was able to catch it to what I am today.. this audio book presented me a chance to remember those huge number of people who played a significant role in my life.. But one thing I personally feel is anyone who has the right attitude to do big opportunities will follow.....,2015-06-21,
8053,1,Absolutely Great!. Loved the way the stories are crafted and well researched. This book makes you a more intelligent person when facing any circumstance.,2015-06-21,
8054,1,"Thought Provoking. I am an entrepreneur and we're always looking for the ""secret"" - the extra edge. This book goes so much deeper than the drama of the accomplishments of someone successful and looks at the background of what led to their circumstances. Enlightening.",2015-06-20,
8055,1,"Incredibly thought provoking.. This book rally speaks to me, being a hockey fan, And, not just a computer geek, but one that is interested in the history of the personal computer.",2015-06-17,
8056,1,"Entertaining and credible read. Concept that hard work, upbringing, experiences and circumstances shape who becomes an outlier vs not is fascinating. Great examples to back it up, in the usual entertaining style of Gladwell.",2015-06-15,
8057,1,"Changes my view of the world. Very interesting. Changes my view of the world, ""successful"" people and my future. Highly recommended for those that are curious about the world around them.",2015-06-14,
8058,1,"I adore malcom gladwell... I love the fact that Malcolm gladwell narrates his own books, you feel his passion. He has made me fall in love with social psychology, and I an currently practicing everything I've learned from his books.",2015-06-13,
8059,1,Excellent Novel. This book really illuminated a lot of truths about life to me. I've always had this mindset of working hard but also bring interdependent and needing to take advantage of any good situation. This book strengthened that view and showed me a world of numbers I was completely blind to. I've already recommended it to a few friends.,2015-06-12,
8060,1,Good book. Enjoyable read. More focus on luck than I expected. You can only be great at something if you both get lucky and try hard.,2015-06-10,
8061,1,Interesting and Eye Opening Read!. Got this audio book to pass the time doing yard work. I spent hours outside just hooked on this book.,2015-06-10,
8062,1,Great book. Gladwell does an excellent job outlining what it takes and doesn't take to be successful.,2015-06-09,
8063,1,"Gladwell is just smart enough.... Gladwells bias towards cultural influence completely skews his ability to see how truly unique many of his ""examples"" are. Like the other Gladwell books I feel as if he is to smart to have missed the obvious fact that these ""examples"" have still accomplished what others who have had similar ""privilege"" have not. Gladwell cherry picks each persons story in an attempt to prove his point while failing to tell each persons whole story. Once again I feel railroaded.",2015-06-09,
8064,1,Fascinating. A book to turn everything you thought you knew about success upside down - or more correctly - right side up. Very well written and wonderfully narrated by the author.,2015-06-07,
8065,0,"Not what i expected at all. Basically a lot of long winded stories, often making it hard to find how it ties into the sunject mater, to get his simple point across. Basically successful people or outliers work very hard to get where they are, have help from family or friends, have hard work and success instilled in them from a young age by their family or culture, and catch lucky breaks along the way. That was the whole book summed up with out all of the filler non sense.",2015-06-07,
8066,1,Engaging stories. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book. The author kept me engaged through sharing his message through wonderful stories. Frequent bookmarking!,2015-06-06,
8067,1,"Excellent book..remarkable!!. This book narrates a theory of success unlike no other. It provides the reader with research-based data, and real life anecdotes that keeps the reader interested and intrigued about what lies ahead!!",2015-06-05,
8068,1,Awesome!. Unique insights on how we think of achievements and success. Engaging. Malcolm Gladwell breaks down his supporting points using captivating real life stories.,2015-06-03,
8069,1,Amazing and fascinating!. An amazingly informative and articulate explanation of why I will never achieve success at the highest level.,2015-05-31,
8070,0,"Garbage. I wish I had saved my money.. A predetermined, narrow, oversimplified conclusion is reached by the author. All success is simply due to someone getting a lucky break. He concludes there is nothing extraordinary about it. They just had lucky breaks by enjoying the right opportunities.",2015-05-30,
8071,1,Excellent book. Always good to be reminded that there's an explanation for everything.,2015-05-28,
8072,1,"Very thought provoking. This book really shines light on the stigmas of success and how it can redirect our attention to the background of those who are seen as elite. Good book, made alot of sense.",2015-05-27,
8073,1,"Excellent nonfiction. I loved Malcolm's style of writing. His use of stories kept this book interesting, fast paced, and relevant. His choice of examples illustrated his premise well. I also thoroughly enjoyed his narration.",2015-05-27,
8074,1,"Excellent. Not what you might expect!. Great to hear a book read by its author, especially when the author is such a good communicator.",2015-05-22,
8075,1,Interesting. Worth the read.. This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and it was a good intro. I found the portion about the speech with the pilots to be the most interesting and thought provoking. Will definitely look for more of his work after this.,2015-05-19,
8076,1,"interesting analysis. I thought it was a great book. I am glad that the author read it. The book was great until the conclusion where it seemed that he bent the stats and stories to fit his conclusion. Even with this issue it was a great analysis and story. I loved the way he showed the connections between the history, chance of time, hard work, ethnicity, and good choices.",2015-05-18,
8077,1,"I can relate.... Initially I thought that I was either very smart or very dumb.... The concept was so simple that I thought maybe I wasn't getting it, but after listening on I was able to relate to everything in the book. It took a subject that has settled into my subconscious and brought it to the fore front of my life.",2015-05-14,
8078,1,Malcolm Gladwell never fails to grip my interest !. Not sure if I am in a 100% agreement with the author's point of view but the book has been a fantastic read. Malcolm never fails to hold my attention!,2015-05-14,
8079,1,Opens your eyes to what is obvious and overlooked. Success is not based in the individual alone in fact the individual is only a result of what shaped him/her and highly driven also by luck and timing.,2015-05-06,
8080,1,Great book. I have heard lots of people quote the book so great to listen and get it,2015-05-05,
8081,1,Very informative. Remarkable attention to detail. This book will change how I approach my students (and people in general) for the rest of my career.,2015-05-02,
8082,1,"Such a Mind Opening Text. Love how Malcolm Gladwell sheds light on the fact that opportunity shapes success; and that putting yourself in the position to have more opportunity, in combination with mastering the skills that are involved with whatever practice seem to be the 2 requirements for ""good luck"" to truly make a difference in a persons life. There are no outliers, only people who in combination with drive and ideas, find the right place and the right time.",2015-05-01,
8083,1,Talent: Necessary but not sufficient for success. I've always struggled with the notion that talent was the key. Not true. great reading.,2015-04-30,
8084,1,Insight on how environment can shape excellence. Gladwell does not disappoint. This is an eye opener wonderfully articulated. It's fascinating to learn about some of the assumptions we have about how to instill greatness in future generations and how we need to break those notions.,2015-04-25,
8085,1,Fun to listen to. Very insightful and encouraging and fascinating book to listen to! You will learn what it means to be given an awesome opportunity!,2015-04-25,
8086,1,A must read for all generations and ethic groups. Loved it! Thought provoking. Make me want to rethink how I teach my kids. Our actions are important and everyone has the ability to be successful it's not just for those that have a high IQ.,2015-04-25,
8087,1,excellently written and delivered!. awesome book! this is a must read for those few who are serious about success and what is truly needed. become an outlier!,2015-04-23,
8088,1,Different perspective of success stories. I liked the analysis which revolves around the title and on the way provides some interesting and informative details . Excellent content,2015-04-23,
8089,1,"nurture over nature. basically, ""you didn't build that"" is the message. While I agree with much of what he says, we can't ignore the hard work these people put into being the best. What good would this good fortune and opportunity be if one didn't seize it?",2015-04-21,
8090,1,"Interesting but lacking. Malcolm Gladwell makes a clear, informative and compelling case, and I definitely enjoyed it and learned from it. However, as valid as his points are, he leaves out a few very important components that should have been addressed (although he refers to it lightly). The most notable is the individual's desire to succeed or even their acceptance of personal responsibility for their role in their success. Very enjoyable, educational and thorough, but with some glaring holes.",2015-03-12,

8092,1,"Great observational connections. I thoroughly enjoyed the connections and insight. However I did feel at moments some observations were ""a stretch""",2015-02-16,
8093,1,The story is very insightful.. I have had the fortune to meet many businesses in exchange for developing and designing websites. Every website project is an opportunity and educational. The Outliers is the answer to what we all want to ask thecowners of the beautiful estates we drive by. In this story we get thectype of onformation pteviously only available to researchets and in a time whete Googling information is in you can think of this book as breath of fresh air.,2015-01-16,
8094,1,"Very stimulating intellectually!. Gladwell challenges the status quo i.e. That outliers are outliers only because they are special, and points out the importance of opportunity and culture....",2014-12-30,
8095,1,"Another way to interpret data. The material in this book is interesting because it looks at data and puts a different interpretation on facts: Why crime rates are falling, the success of different cultural groups and why language rules makes some learning easier, etc. I especially enjoy listening to Malcolm Gladwell read his books--this is the third of his I've listened to. I plan to listen to all of them, his insights are noteworthy and his performance makes listening so soothing.",2014-02-13,
8096,1,"Insightful, but less than fully convincing. I enjoyed Mr Gladwell's reading thoroughly. His delivery and voice are well suited to reading and I always enjoy hearing an author read their own material.",2013-08-30,
8097,1,"Amazing book! A life changer!. With 165 downloads and a small library of paperbacks I think it is fair to say I have read my share of books. And with having said that, I can say that this is one book that I will read over again multiple times. It is one of the most interesting books I have ever listened to.",2013-06-18,
8098,1,"Makes you think!!!. Outliers made me think about my own past. He makes some good points about how certain systems we have in society effect us more than we realize. For instance, the location of our schooling and the age cut off dates when we began school might have caused a beneficial trend or the opposite in our life. These little advantages help to shape our growth within these systems more that we might realize. On the surface these truths may seem obvious but he goes into some detail about how it all plays out and that's pretty interesting.",2013-02-10,
8099,1,"Inspiring and interesting. I have been quoting this book to friends on several occasions since finishing it. Or rather, since beginning to listen to it! I think that says a lot. It inspired me in the same kind of way as Freakonomics did when I read it a number of years ago. There is more reasoning in Outliers and it is more down to earth but there are similarities in how theories and models are applied to the things we all can relate to.",2012-08-27,
8100,1,"Stellar Listen. This is a stellar listen. Story moves rapidly enough to keep one's attention, but paced enough not to lose the listener. Authour's reputation did not disappoint. I especially loved the way stuff hidden in plain sight about the story of success and mostly taken for granted can contribute so much to the subject...Makes listener reflect, relate and hopefully adjust to accommodate success in their own lives.",2012-07-23,
8101,1,"So much more than just genius and talent. When you were born, to whom you were born, where you were born, how hard you work, how your culture molds your values and behavior. It goes on and on. Gladwell has some intriguing theories that he defends well. He breaks the book up into case studies that ""prove"" various points of his thesis. They are all interesting, but my favorite was the one about his own family history in Jamaica.",2012-07-22,
8102,1,"Interesting Info, not the greatest narrator. The information in the book is fascinating -- it's incredible how much our circumstances determine our successes and how relatively little our so-called ""innate talents"" or ""drive"" do. That being said, I feel that Gladwell could have given more rounded history and perhaps more encouragement to those of us who haven't been doing X activity since age 5. Gladwell also isn't very good at inflecting his voice when he quotes others in the reading, making it difficult on occasion to tell when he's quoting. Towards the end he also gets a bit singsong-y. Overall very worth the listen.",2012-07-20,

8108,1,"Solid Gladwell. What separates star athletes, scientists and entrepreneurs from the rest of us? What sort of stuff are self made millionaires made of? Malcolm Gladwell tackles the stereotype of the independently successful in his book Outliers. From rags to riches, or riches to rags, each of us are profoundly influenced by our environment. Gladwell argues that there is no such thing as the self made man and that your future is more inherited than earned. His focus is on environmental factors such as date of birth, geography and family heritage. Want to know the best month to be born to become a famous NHL hockey player? What about the right year to become a technology mogul? Gladwell highlights a series of markers that will exert the greatest amount of influence over ones future successes or failures.",2012-05-21,
8109,0,"Typical leftist propaganda. I was very interested to hear about the circumstances that lead to great achievement but what I didn't expect was to hear ( at the end of the book during the interview with the author) that this is more about leftist liberal ideology than scientific research. I think this may have been where Barack Obama came up with the statement ""you didn't build that"". I agree that conditions need to be right for people to achieve greatness but I completely disagree with the premise that these individuals weren't special. It's like a seed being planted on good ground or bad ground. If you're a mediocre seed in good ground you won't turn into much but the occasional special seed can become a mighty Redwood. To say that Redwood only became great because it was is the right soil completely ignores the spectacular strength and ability that's part of it's exceptionalism. To ignore that is extremely short-sighted.",2012-05-01,

8111,1,"Fantastic!. The concept that ""self-made"" successes are a myth tweaked me just enough to have to listen to this book. I planned to shoot down the concept and emerge with my pre-conceived notions intact, but I stand very much corrected. While anyone who becomes exceptional has to demonstrate drive, desire and a work ethic to match their talent, anyone who becomes exceptional cannot do so without help...from somewhere. I find myself drawing on stories from the book in management training sessions for my clients!",2012-04-02,
8112,1,"Great but.... Malcolm Gladwell's style is engaging no matter what but in this book he tends to twist some stories to fit into the flow of ideas, he tends to mix between correlation and causation and over-dramatizes some stories.",2012-03-28,
8113,1,"Great Book!. Gladwell does and excellent job of taking percieved ""Outliers"" and drawing connections and patterns that make the reader understand opportunity & legacy plan key roles in determining outcomes. He challenges the reader to not simply accept ""Innate Talent"" as the viable reasons for truely exceptional results.",2012-02-06,
8114,1,"A great way to understand the influence of culture. Culture, Society, Upbringing, Parents play a vital role in a person's character and the development of the genius. This book explains it beautifully, with lots of real stories. The stories themselves are very sticky. If you are thinking that a genius is 'only' a product of cultural influence, then you have read too much into it; from the book's perspective it is merely saying that a genius is 'also' a product of such influence.",2012-02-03,

8116,1,"Well researched, well read, great perspective.. Couldn't be more pleased with this book.

8117,1,"Outliers is an outlier. Gladwell is a talented communicator and his style makes the book easy to follow and totally engaging.

8120,1,"Think Again. This book will make you think again about stories of success. If you're in the business of education or coaching, this book will change the way you approach the process.",2011-11-25,
8121,1,Good Explaination for Success. I found this book a great explanation for the factors outside of one's control that have set them up for great success but completely lacks information or credence about the things those same people did that they did control that gave them chance to take those factors and make them work in their favor.  Things we all should do to give us a chance to take the sum total influences of our own life and to direct them to our own Outlier experience. Otherwise this information is a bit depressing. Good for them but what does it do for me.,2011-11-25,
8122,1,A smart book for smart people. It makes you think and question all of the assumptions around common beliefs from running a business to how we raise our children. Blending statistics with stories reveals our current world under a new light. It's wonderful and a must read.,2011-11-22,
8123,1,"Good read. This book has an interesting premise (that extreme success is not as random as it might first appear), and develops well.",2011-11-13,
8124,1,"Wow. I cannot say enough about this book. First, the stories are engaging and the logical thought process by the author and his arguments are very convincing. I find myself thinking of the book while watching the news on a daily basis! This book is that applicable to the real world. You start realizing how people became successful and you quickly realize characteristics that make people unsuccessful. All in all, a fascinating experience.",2011-11-11,
8125,1,Get this.. I really enjoyed listening to Malcolm Gladwell. He is a hell of a story teller. I recommend this audiobook.,2011-11-08,
8126,1,My first listen!. Absolutely fabulous! For a First listen I couldn't put my ipod down! Even while I was at work! An absolute great book all around!,2011-10-08,
8127,1,"Always Good. Malcolm Gladwell bounces back with Outliers. I loved Tipping Point and disappointed by Blink, but find this book worth the time, thought, and information.",2011-10-05,
8128,1,"Great Book. as usual, Malcolm Gladwell gets your attention and keeps it. Well worth listening to and going back and listening again.",2011-10-04,
8129,1,"Gladwell makes you think. If you don't want to just 'consume' books and you enjoy inspiring thoughts, Gladwell won't disappoint you. He is using illustrative examples from real world, easy to remember, easy to believe.",2011-09-18,
8130,1,Really makes you think. I've always told others that usually there's more to the story about someones success then what appears. Malcolm finally proves that to be true. Though I have not bought in 100% on the cultural bias from far far back I do believe there is a cultural bias in many things.,2011-08-30,
8131,1,"Amazing!. My friend recommended this over a year ago and I just got around to reading it. It was such a great new way to look at how success is perceived in the sporting world, classrooms, and the world. Being a teacher, I thought it gave a great new way to look at how we give students opportunities to work hard and do well. Highly recommend!",2011-08-27,
8132,1,"Great!. Enjoyed it very much...quite factual, entertaining and very interesting. I highly recommend this book.",2011-08-27,
8133,1,FANTASTIC. The book was very well written and harbored a lot of personal opinions for the author. Because of the personal nature of the book something would have been lost had he not narrated it himself. It was a great book and a great narration by the author! ENJOY!,2011-08-25,
8134,1,"Smart Book. Well read. Very thought provoking. There are alot of lists in this book - which would be easier to skim in a ""real"" book - a bit tedious to hear them read outloud. But it includes lots of great stories and characters.",2011-07-30,
8135,1,Excellent read. Great book. Very thought provoking. It gave me a new way to look at life and success. a must read for every teenager and young adult today.,2011-07-08,
8136,1,"Excellent!. I can't believe it took me this long to read (listen to) this book. Good reminder that greatness isn't only based on natural talent but is enhanced by environmental realities and a ""blue collar"" work ethic.",2011-07-04,
8137,1,"Fun and Informative. Although Gladwell has been taken to task for over simplifying things, Outliers is still intriguing because it gives you a glimpse of processes that happen invisibly in our daily lives. It will also make you count up how many hours you've been practicing certain things and maybe decide whether it's worth it to continue... Gladwell reads his own book well. Listen if you enjoy learning about all those little things you may have once wondered about successful people but never had the time to go find out yourself.",2011-06-18,
8138,1,I still think about what he said in this book!. This book has so much practical common sense and insight. I still think about this book even after reading it a two years ago. I think I'm going to go back and listen to it again. It's so insightful.,2011-06-06,
8139,1,"A Unique View of Success. This book has a different perspective on what makes people successful. It's not just rugged individulalism that determines greatness. A lot of other factors need to be there - opportunity, location, timing and even a little luck. There are some points that I don't agree with. But, as always Gladwell gets you to really look at things differently. If you study success and the successful you will want to add this book to your list. If you get the audio book as I did, make sure you listed to the interview at the end.",2011-06-06,
8140,1,"Born too late. What a discovery! Gladwell has finally revealed to me the secret of why my son, born in September, couldn't shape in his age group as a swimmer. A brilliant concept and a brilliant book. Very appropriately narrated by the author.",2011-05-30,
8141,1,Always Enjoy. I always enjoy hearing Malcolm talk through his analysis and justification of patterns in the world. Even better as an audiobook,2011-05-05,
8142,1,"READ IT ! im tealing you !!!. I love the way that Gladwell is executing this book he is not going around circles with the same idea and same topic, instead his research is well founded, simple and eye opening ,you will learn something with every chapter of this book in a way that is simple to recall and remember",2011-04-30,
8143,1,Very Good. This is a very good book and an eye opener. I wonder how some of the concepts apply to what is going on today and what kind of successful people we will see in the future.,2011-04-23,
8144,1,"Will change the way you look at information. This book has some incredible stories and a new way of looking at the narrative of success. I have been thinking about the data that proves our schools vacation time is a bigger problem for students learning than how our teachers are teaching. Why has it not received more attention!? It has so many implications that are ""solvable"" and some that are not expensive.",2011-03-02,
8145,1,"It'll get you thinking!. I found this book so interesting on so many levels. The author reaches back in history to explain some of the reasons for our modern day triumphs and pitfalls. As a teacher I found the historical and cultural implications valuable. As you wind through the tales on the various people or groups that he focuses on, you'll begin questioning what advantages you had in your lifetime to bring you to where you are today and why.",2011-02-22,
8146,1,Very interesting. I loved this book! Gladwell toches a lot of subjects that you've thought of & gives you new ways to look at them. Making you question things you took for truth. I have recommended this book to many of my friends & will continue to do so.,2011-01-19,
8147,1,"Highly Insightful. My husband and I listened to this book on a road trip and we LOVED it. Mr. Gladwell writes such interesting points that he has clearly researched. We both learned a ton from listening to Outliers and I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone interested.",2011-01-03,
8148,1,"Great Perspective based upon how you grew up. I enjoyed this book greatly, It answered the question - Is it just that people have all the money and then find a great idea? What's so much different than an ""urban"" kid vs a ""privileged"" kid. One part of the equation is exposure.",2010-12-22,
8149,1,"A Must Listen!!!! Somewhat disturbing yet.... Somewhat disturbing yet can be encouraging...Disturbing because the logic for success can be SO OUT OF OUR CONTROL yet encouraging because our choices can still effect our ability to take advantage of the coming unknowns.

8150,1,"should not have put it off so long. I had resisted this book for a long time, having some difficulty with the premises as represented in reviews and critiques.

8152,1,"Thought-provoking. I don't normally read non-fiction, but I found this book really captured my imagination and got me thinking. I would say that Gladwell is one of the prominent thought-shapers of our time, and his ideas will hold your interest, even if you chose to disagree with them.",2010-10-31,
8153,1,"stimulating & thought provoking. I really enjoyed the book. I loved all of Malcom's books, I think he's brilliant. I found Malcom's thesis very compelling and his theories struck a chord with me, solid logic.",2010-10-28,

8155,1,"Amazing author with an way of looking at the world. What an amazing book. I could go on for quite a while about how interesting and inspiring this book is for all of those who look at the world an see themselves as outliers in one way or another.

Inspires you to take advantage of any and every opportunity that comes your way.",2010-10-04,
8156,1,"No secret of success, but good ideas!. This is a very nice book to listen to, with many eye-openers that I feel like looking deeper into. Gladwell brushes the surface on many concepts, but connects them in a seemingly logical way.",2010-09-13,

8159,1,"Great-ish. I loved listening to this book, was entertained the whole way and amazed by some of the topics covered in it. However, after doing a bit more research found that not everything in it was quite right. Even if there is some errors in it, I still rate Outliers quite highly because it did change the way I look at a lot of things.",2010-06-08,
8160,1,Another Winner!. Another winner for Malcolm Gladwell. A life changer and a small seed of knowledge that continues to impact my everyday world.,2010-06-01,
8161,1,"Gets you thinking. This book was amazing. As soon as I started listening, the way I thought about things and the world started to change. I began noticing patterns in things that I hadn't ever noticed before. I highly recommend this book to get your mind thinking out of the box.",2010-06-01,
8162,1,"Great book, great narrator. This was my first introduction to audio books and now I am spoiled! This is not only an interesting and compelling book but the narration was excellent -- it reads almost like a mystery in a way, even though it's not -- you are always wanting to find out what's around the corner.",2010-05-23,
8163,1,"Outstanding!. What a fascinating way to analyze such a controversial subject as &#168;success and riches&#168; and why some achieve it, while others don't. Much better than a dozen self-help books put together. A smart view on how everyone is entitled to achieve and understand their own success, if one can only understand where he stands and what is available to oneself.",2010-05-23,
8164,1,Shocking!!!. Personal success has a new definition. I enjoyed reading about the striking facts and circumstances that could shape someone's life and add a new meaning to success.,2010-05-13,
8165,1,Very Enlightening. I was enthralled from the start. This is the 3rd book of Gladwell's that I've heard and probably my favorite. It gave me a greater sense of how success is really achieved and what I might do to enhance my chances of success and that of my children.,2010-05-07,
8166,1,"Outliers. An interesting perspective about success. A must read for anyone who is goal-driven and has aspirations to become ""successful"".",2010-04-18,
8167,1,"Engaging. This, Gladwell's third book, was the first I experienced... my response, I immediately bought the first two (The Tipping Point and Blink) and will buy his latest very soon. This is well written, easy to understand, interesting, engaging, and useful. I loved it and find myself telling people about it alot.",2010-03-13,
8168,1,Fascinating. Better than Tipping Point and Freakonomics because Gladwell is able to tie shorter vignettes into a larger theme.,2010-03-09,

8170,1,"Inspiring. I found this book extremely interesting - about how success is earned and not just for the fortunate few. Once I had stopped listening, I couldn't wait to pick up on it again.",2010-02-21,
8171,1,"Fascinating listen.... While the theory entertained in this book may not be totally well backed in science, it makes sense and makes for an entertaining book. Perhaps most interesting is the epilogue that explains why the author wrote the book. Learning something about Gladwell and his background was fascinating.",2010-02-19,
8172,1,Insightful and interesting!. Malcolm does well in this book. He looks at the conventional wisdom of success and challenges is using well researched historical and current examples. Definitely worth a listen,2010-01-31,
8173,1,"Utterly fascinating!. I was riveted from the beginning of the book. I think every parent/grandparent should definitely listen/read this book and consider the information in it. Even if you don't have the responsibility of influencing the next generation, it is quite something to consider and contemplate how ideas, actions, culture and opportunities have shaped your own life. After reading this, you may even decide to take a new direction from this moment forward. Certainly it will give you a new view of the world and the people in it.",2010-01-23,
8174,1,"Timely and a must-read for busines leaders. Normally, a book like Outliers appeals more to people interested in learning about new cultural shifts. As a entrepreneur and businessman, I was amazed to learn how the information presented in this book can easily be applied to business relationships.",2010-01-20,
8175,1,"Great Comparisons. I really liked the data that Mr Gladwell compiled! It was very interesting to see all these successful men and how there are similarities with them- age, birthdays, etc. For example, Why are most Hockey players born between Jan and March? Get the book to find out!",2010-01-14,
8176,1,"Best of Gladwell. I really didn't see what the hype was with his other books, I liked them but I was not blown away. Then came Outliers...what a great book, I listened to it then went out and bought the hardcover, and then listen to it again. So insightful, in his ideas and stories. A must read/hear",2010-01-05,
8177,1,"inspired and inspirational. great book, from beginning to end.",2009-12-29,
8178,1,"Great book, I different paradigm of success. This book will open your eyes and set your expectations of success to a more realistic paradigm. It has given me a much better idea of what I need to do to support my kid's success. Its very easy to follow and clearly shows how we have no limits but we have to understend our context in life to be really an outlier.",2009-12-20,
8179,1,Thought Provoking and Entertaining. Gladwell ferrets out the myths that we would like to be true but always knew weren't that simple. I'd give the book 4.5 stars because the section on education doesn't address how Finish kids manage to score the best globally while at the same time not attending school in the same proportion as the children in the far east.,2009-12-04,
8180,1,Entertaining. Loved this book by Malcolm Gladwell. The stories are entertaining and thought provoking; a great listen for your daily commute or a long drive!,2009-11-29,
8181,1,"Loved it!. A great book that suprisingly to me turned out to b great to listen to. I was a little worried knowing that Gladwell typically uses a lot of statistics in his writing, but it held my attention quite well.",2009-11-22,
8182,1,"interesting concepts. Interesting concepts, good ideas but I felt it lacked a central theme.",2009-11-19,
8183,1,every parent should read this book. This is an amazing book. Explanation on why some children are smarter and some not is a great read and something every parent should be aware of. It will help guard against cultural traits (every culture has some) that could prevent future generation from becoming successful/outliers.,2009-11-15,
8184,1,"Interesting Stories. Gladwell does a great a job in most chapters, but a couple are not relevant.",2009-11-07,
8185,1,Thought Provoking & Insightful. Such a thought provoking book - I will be listening to this over several times. Highly Recommended to anyone interested in 'group' growth & group dynamics.,2009-10-30,
8186,1,I'm not worthy of reviewing such a brilliant book. I will try.,2009-10-22,

8189,1,"Fascinating. This was so interesting and also well-written and well-read--he could have gone on with many more examples and I would have just kept listening! Particularly interesting to me was the information on intelligence and highly intelligent people. I love the idea that a certain IQ is ""smart enough"" and beyond does not predict increased success. I do know at least one person who is Mensa-certifed who was never able to hold a job or attain any level of success. Also, it is nice to know that good, old-fashioned hard work accounts for most of success that people achieve.",2009-10-04,
8190,1,"Interesting.... A lot to think about, though I might need to buy a paper copy to check out some of the references. Although admittedly, listening to these ideas made me a little depressed...",2009-10-02,
8191,1,"Extraordinary. As usual, Gladwell makes a great case for thinking in new ways about the world. His accessible writing and compelling stories keeps the reader engaged. Well worth my money and time.",2009-09-13,
8192,1,Be in the right place at the right time. I found this book entertaining and informative. While Mr. Gladwell does not discount talent he asserts that opportunity is the main driver of becoming excellent at something. That and practice and/or persistence.,2009-09-11,
8193,1,"great listen for a long drive. Interesting and provocative, this work has the usual preface to each chapter consisting of a small story- individual or localized situation- and then broadens the perspective of the time, the place, and the mental attitudes of the people involved. The insights on heart disease were particularly interesting, as well as the differing parenting methods and how some kids get lost in the cracks and some excel. Things you know are true, but have a new light shed on them. Every teacher and parent should read this book.",2009-09-09,
8194,1,HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book. Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221; My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work. The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other. Well how does the author know this? Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates? To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control). Fun book. I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,2009-08-23,
8195,1,"Fantastic book. I really enjoyed this book. Some of the people here point out that there is no practical advice, so the first 2 times that I checked out the book on here I didn't end up getting it. But I had multiple people tell me to check it out so I finally got it.",2009-08-18,
8196,1,"Enjoyed this one a lot. I haven't listened to too many non-fiction books because I wasn't sure if I could follow them or not. Outliers was my first, and it was great! First the content was eye-opening. I enjoyed the stories told and the lessons learned from them. Second, I like to listen to book that are narrated by the author because you can hear the words the way the author intended. Gladwell is a really good narrator. Highly recommended.",2009-08-15,
8197,1,"a. Interesting subject. Gladwell states and backs up his belief that opportunities are more important than talent and IQ. Well written, funny and informative. Makes you think differently about your own life and choices you have made.",2009-08-10,
8198,1,One of the best. This is one of Mr. Gladwell's best books as he put his heart and sole into this one. You can also find out why by listening to his confession at the end of the book.,2009-07-16,
8199,1,Excellent!. If you want to be successful or have a successful kid...read this book. It changed my prespective.,2009-07-12,

8201,1,I'm a believer. Gladwell takes me on an unexpected journey far from my belief systems that savvy and hard work were the key to success. He has opened my eyes to theories about the way the world works that I had never contemplated. Incredibly compelling.,2009-07-05,
8202,1,"Recommended for any parent .. I recommend this for anyone with children.  This is a real eye open. The author is clear, distinct and gives great examples.   The examples converge to give a scientific like explanation. I think this is Malcolm&#8217;s best work.  I listened to the Tipping point which was also great but Outliers was much more interesting.   The audio quality was acceptable.",2009-06-30,
8203,1,"Very enlightening. I read this after reading Talent is Overrated. Gladwell agrees that a person needs 10,000 hours of practice to be great, and examines the circumstances that allow intensive practice to happen. It's not all hard work - luck plays a huge role.",2009-06-27,
8204,1,"Understanding beyond outliers. Outliers really goes beyond explaining those that excel above everyone else, like Bill Gates and the Beatles. It also explains why some fail, such as pilots and co-pilots following cultural practices rather than safe communication techniques. And, finally it explains how all of us arrive with birth gifts from our past that influence our journey. A great read.",2009-06-26,
8205,1,10.000 hours.... I'm still in shock to realize that I've used 10.000 hours in something I didn't want to!! There's a lesson in every story that Mr. Gladwell shares and if you are a parent trying to define success for your child this is the book to have: you'll learn that it depends on many factors being you (the parent) a key factor!,2009-06-24,
8206,1,"Very good. This is good. This is easy to listen to, well narrated. But good information which makes a lot of sense. I recommend all Audible listeners to definitely include this on their lists.",2009-06-22,

8208,1,"Highly recommend. If you've ever wondered how Bill Gates became the success that he is or why Asian kids score so well on math tests, this is the book for you.

8210,1,"An Intriguing Read..... This book covers intersting social factors that may determine successful individuals. The author makes you think about culture, educational achievement, and hard work in a new way. As it is an entertaining read, the applied economic theories are a bit stretched. Overall, I would recommend Outliers but, follow it up with a book written by a true economist.",2009-05-04,
8211,1,Well worth the time. The content has slight biases but they do not detract from the viability of the analysis. There never appears to be an agenda to find demons or victims -- just reasonable explanations. The ideas were very eye-opening.,2009-05-04,

8217,1,Excellent book. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this. Gladwell's books always seemed to teach me new things and this certainly did the same. It provided me an excellent education about many of the strange things that seemed like a coincidence learned that it was not in fact a coincidence but a strange series of events that all were very definable using numbers.,2009-03-06,

There is never a short cut to success, there is however circumstances that many see as disadvantages but in the end play as the fabric of a suit being carefully woven by a master tailor, at the end you get a beutiful suit that makes people wonder where you got it. This book changed how I see success. From the idea of genius to how the way your raised actually does affect you for the rest of you life. I couldnt stop listening.

8224,1,"Fascinating and enjoyable. Although some of Gladwell's assertions are subject to debate, there is no doubt that they are well presented and certainly make good ""food for thought"".",2009-01-26,
8225,1,"Gladwell is brilliant again!!. This may be his best work. Tipping points are now a clich? in business and media, but this work is a uniquely valuable insight about our misconceptions on personal success and is actually strongly tied to the Fundamental Attribution Error in psychology, which dates back to work done in 1967 and later coined in 1977;. It is absolutely worth the time and should improve your view on how success in yourself and others is best obtained.",2009-01-15,

8227,1,"Excellent book!!!!!!!. This was a very enjoyable listen. Extremely informative -- as a Canadian, I now plan on having my kids in the first few months of the year (you'll understand once you've read the book). Empowers you to feel that you too can be great. Gladwell himself narrates the book and his voice is clear and soothing. A definite recommendation to friends.",2008-12-30,
8228,1,Malcom's best book yet.. This was a great listen. Both the audio and context was excellent. It was one of those books you will be discussing with your friends.,2008-12-18,
8229,0,"The Chicken or the Egg. Life is unfair. Yes, different opportunities face all of us. However, and this is what the book seems to ignore, it is up to the individual to recognize and act. So, I don't believe it is the opportunity that make an outlier, it is the recognition of the opportunities, vision, desire, determination and action that produced the likes of Bill Gates. Keep in mind Bill Gates went to middle school with 300 other kids who all had the same access to the computer. So didn't all 300 have the same opportunity?",2008-12-18,
8230,1,"Very interesting, marginally useful... still a 5.. This book is very interesting with good stories throughout. It is marginally useful as to practical information for most people. I still would recommend it and have rated it as a 5. I am going to listen to it more than once.",2008-12-31,

8232,1,"4 ½ stars.. I was amazed and surprised at what I learned about what makes people successful. And it’s entertaining. I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff.",2012-10-02,

8235,1,"Captivating!. Really enjoyed! Well written - The author has done an excellent job in sharing his perspective on how the rich got richer and the famous became more famous... being in the right place at the right time..... Malcolm has a wonderful voice that fits the story perfectly. The last half addresses the importance of communications and the problems and conflicts we get into due to our socialism, heritages and ethnicity. Can't wait to read his other books!",2009-07-30,
8236,1,Entertaining and quick. A nice and short series of statistical oddities that makes one think twice about what leads to personal success. This is not a scientifically exhaustive approach. But a great listen and easy to follow and absorb.,2009-07-11,
8237,1,"Another Malcolm Gladwell success story!. ""Outliers - the story of success"" is worth your while! This is what a popular discussion of science (in the sociology/psychology field) should be like. It is entertaining, as well as challenging conventional wisdom. Well written, and energetically read by the author himself. I especially enjoyed the references to the work of the Dutch researcher Hofstede on culture.",2009-06-15,
8238,1,A must read for parents. This makes makes you look at things a different way. The messages it makes with its backup stories are a must for anyone who wants to get ahead and who want their kids to succeed. This was my first audiobook and I found very easy to listen to and I could come back to it a week later and still pick up easily where I left off. The messages stuck with me. If all audiobooks are like this then I am hooked.,2009-06-10,
8239,1,"Entertaining and Educational. Malcolm Gladwell's third book is another masterpiece. It is engaging, entertaining, and educational.

8240,1,"Completely engaging!. I found this book completely engaging. It helps to understand why some can rise to highest level of success. It has lot more to due with unusual early circumstances than more than just hard work. What month you are born, what year you were born in and early exposure to coaching or technology created many of the giant outliers of today. Takes some randomness of luck out of many of these individuals personal stories, or at least identifies the underlying events that help create the lucky circumstances for these select individuals. All the outliers are great hard working people who maximized their early advantanges to reach to top of their fields. Great insight!",2008-12-10,

8269,1,"Fascinating. This is not my first Gladwell book. I find his perspective fascinating. During my review of the book, I did occasionally think to myself that some of his conclusions are based on anecdote. however overall, I believe that he had an important perspective to the mythology of personal success and rugged individualism. It was a page-turner. I do recommend this book highly to anybody interested in understanding all of the components that go into making a successful individual.",2015-03-25,

8284,1,A nice dose of anti-individualism. Malcolm Gladwell Texas on a journey deep into the roots of successful people to show us that we are more like them then we may have ever imagined. he also provides evidence to suggest that communities cultural legacies are as important as individual contributions in the story of a successful person.,2015-02-26,
8285,1,Meaningful. It feels like a story. Even though it's 20 stories it never feels like data research. I'm astonished at how many stories he tells. I often find myself trying to retell particular stories from his book because they seem to relate quickly to the rest of my life and the lives of others around me.,2015-02-24,
8286,1,well written!. impressed with the details. really makes you think. i wonder what opportunities i missed! will read his other books.,2015-02-20,

8310,1,"Good content, some takeaways, can be dry. In Outliers, Gladwell looks at particular success stories and culture stereotypes to explain that our successes and failures are results of our circumstances. For the most part, the individual stories and chapters are interesting but there are some that I found boring. If you enjoy having your beliefs tested and thinking about things in different ways, this is a great book with some practical information you can apply to your life.",2014-07-15,
8311,1,"Great Book. The Beatles. Bill Gates. Chinese rice farmers. Such a motley crew. Who would imagine that they have so much in common. This book had me from the get go just like a good novel would. Authors reading their own work is risky business but Malcolm Gladwell ROCKS it. He knows his material so eel - and it's so interesting - l that it feels like he's telling a good story rather than reading nonfiction. And he's as good a narrator as any - great inflection, perfect pace, fabulous content. Who could ask for more?!  This book opened my eyes in wonderful ways to what it takes to be successful. And his insights into the real problems with our educational system, was worth the entire book. If you are reading this, GET THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.",2013-11-16,

8313,1,"Interesting but not extraordinary. A book loaded with interesting insights, Outliers is compelling in the way that chain emails capture the attention with their surprising stories. But Gladwell's preoccupation with explaining individual greatness as the product of its unique environment seemed a socialist twist on suggesting that greatness is possible and achieved not by individual effort, but by circumstance, and therefor failure to achieve excellence is acceptable because the circumstances were obviously not favorable or conducive.",2013-05-11,
8314,1,"Inightful read. I have, on paperback, every title that Malcolm has written and I'm just beginning to get the audios. It's really nice that he didn't delegate the voicing of this audio; it wouldn't have sounded believable to me. Listening to the audio is like having Malcolm talking in your head!

8316,1,An interesting and easy listen. The reasons for success are really quite incredible as evidenced by the research that Malcolm Gladwell has done. I chose this book because my sons (in their mid twenties) told me it was great. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. I think listening to this book would probably be easier than reading it because of the statistical information. Not one to read this type of book (prefer fiction and escapism) I expected to be bored but I was intrigued. It was even more interesting that it was read by Malcolm Gladwell himself. I would highly recommend this book.,2013-02-24,
8317,1,"The stories in ""Outliers"" gave me new perspectives. The stories in this book helped present new perspectives on factors leading to success.

8320,1,"Success Defined. Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining where success comes from. While yes, it comes from hard work, it also has a strong basis in context and in opportunities.

8323,1,Great book. Looking forward to listening to more. I love the detail provided to a classic problem on success. It is relaxing to know that while my child may not be best in the world based on our current societal makeup and birthday. He or she can still be good by devoting time and energy and by parents creating opportunities for expert support.,2012-09-20,
8324,1,My first experience with Gladwell - Excellent!. I picked this title based on reviews I'd heard of Gladwell's work and wasn't disappointed. Found it to be insightful and thought provoking. A great book for those interested in the learning more about the 'secret to success'.,2012-06-12,

8326,1,"Great informational storyteller. I was concerned a book like this would end up reading like a textbook...dry and a snoozer.

8327,1,"This book changed my life. I was stuck in a rut as a croquet player. After reading this book, I began to understand that you don't excel at something unless a) you put in an enormous amount of time and b) you are in the right place at the right time. I followed a) and found myself in b). The result is that my croquet game has improved by light years. This principle applies to anything in life. Reading this book was an epiphany for me. Few books have impacted me in this way.",2010-09-07,
8328,1,"A Different Look at Success. I really enjoyed this book. Gladwell makes you look at how people succeed in a totally different way. The thought that it takes a person 10 000 hours to become really good at something is somehow depressing and inspiring at the same time. Also, the thought that even if you put in the time to become a master at something that a person only becomes successful under the right circumstances is also a little depressing. But it was definitely a worthwhile read and really gives you something to think about.",2010-07-27,
8329,1,Still recommending this one!. Long after I read this I've been mulling over the ramifications of what shapes our success (and failures). Probably edges out 'Blink' and just a little more interesting for my line of work than 'What the Dog Saw'. Both of those books still worthy of the highest rating.,2010-07-09,
8330,1,cool and the gang. I liked it. I think it's the perfect book for people who want to make sure their kids be overachievers. haha.Really it's a interesting book an hope you get it and enjoy listening to it. It definitely gets you thinking.,2010-04-19,

8334,1,Success Takes Support. I was both saddened and encouraged as I saw ways my youth hindered my success in some areas and promoted it in other directions.

8335,1,One of my favorite books hands down. this book is a classic and beautifully written.,2009-10-14,

This is a very well written book that outlines how it's not just the individual who creates his/her own success, but how success is dependent on a number of factors that are completely outside of his/her control. He emphasizes the need for hard work - 10,000 hours - a message I believe we don't spend enough time advocating to our children today and he raises what I would consider some valid concerns about our public school system that seems to validate what is also advocated by Thomas Friedman in The World is Flat. What we need now is a book that provides some concrete recommendations that can balance the need to better educate ALL children while still allowing them to have ""free time"" to think, as is urged by professionals like Ned Hallowell, to avoid being ""Crazy Busy"".

In this book, Mr. Gladwell, looking from a different perspective, shines a whole new light on the process. From hockey to billionaires, His theory posits that it takes more than skill or a genius mind to find the pinnacle of success. Timing and opportunity seem to play a larger role than we may have suspected. As I listened though, the truth seems to be quite clear. It takes a lot of things to line up just right to make a world changing individual. This is a great wake up call for parents, teachers, coaches or anybody else that might be in a position to guide, train or support a young aspirant in any field or endeavor.

8377,1,"Good but not like Talking To Strangers. This was a very interesting audiobook. Gladwell looks at success through a different lens. He examines success not just by hard work but by timing. Gladwell explains the 10,000 hour rule - it takes 10,000 hours of intense practice to become an expert at something. ut success is also a product of timing. The majority of professional hockey players are born at the beginning months of the year coinciding with the youth league age cutoff. Wealthiest men of the Industrial Age are born within 10 years. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, & Bill Joi born within months of each other. ladwell also examines how culture plays a part of success too. However, I felt that Chapter 7 on plane crashes which examines cultural reasons for communication breakdowns during flight emergencies didn’t really fit into this book about “success.” fter reading Gladwell’s book Talking to Strangers, this book was a bit of a disappointment.

I really thought that the cliche story of success had some truth in it, but apparently I was wrong. According to reviews like Rebecca on Goodreads, who said, “My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis,” this theory of Gladwell’s is very true. My only criticism is the lack of female representation by Gladwell. Allie from Goodreads agrees with me, saying, “Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem.” But overall. I thought the book was quite enjoyable and would recommend.",2017-03-21,

Although the points are occasionally repetitive and over-drawn, Gladwell makes the point of using examples that force us to rethink the definition of ""success"". It doesn't have to mean innate ability to be smarter or more innovative than others, and can depend on a person's circumstances in life. ooking back, however, I realized there were only 3-4 chapters that I found myself truly immersed in his theories. I wasn't very fond of the fact that he spent 46 pages talking about plane crashes when the point was easily established in a third of that amount of pages. On the other hand, I related to and felt that he did a solid job analyzing the success rates of students that wait an extra year to start elementary school versus students that start earlier and are the youngest in their grade. Additionally, I liked his take on the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" because it essentially provided a perspective behind the reward of hard work. astly, for the first half of the book, Mr. Malcolm Gladwell comes off as quite pretentious, almost as if his theories are superior to all others considering the subject matter. Even though the book is well written and makes good points, it wasn't particularly groundbreaking. It had some really good parts, and some parts I didn't enjoy as much.",2017-03-16,

8387,1,"Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined .... Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined my interpretation of what it means to be human, and what it takes for a person to thrive and be successful. The book takes the reader through a series of stories and scenarios that prove that natural talent doesn’t necessarily exist. In fact, the characteristics that define who we are and how we act stem from a huge underground network that includes what time of the year we were born, our heritage, and other things. For example, the country in which we grew up correlates to our confidence when standing up to authority. Americans are inherently unafraid of the distance between a powerful figure and a subordinate, while people of nations such as Russia don’t normally speak up against those more powerful than them. opics like these are openly explored in ""Outliers"" in a clever blend of storytelling and statistics. Sometimes I was reading a novel, other times a book on psychology, and even at times, a book that would be right at home in the self-help section. ""Outliers"" is fast-paced yet descriptive and never caught me lacking focus and attention while reading it, especially considering that nonfiction books easily become very dry and difficult for me to read. However, ""Outliers"" tackles such a unique idea and approaches it in a way that gives the book immense reread value. After finishing the book, I’ve been inspired to look further into some of the researchers and studies the book referenced throughout. I believe that the best books are the ones that keep you thinking even after you’ve finished them, and there is no doubt that ""Outliers"" is extremely thought-provoking. While some chapters were more interesting and relevant to me than others, otherwise, it’s really difficult for me to find flaws with this book. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to know more about the inner workings of the world and even about themselves. ""Outliers"" provides unique insight on the natural tendencies of man and why successful people are so, also influencing the reader to evaluate how they, themselves, can thrive.",2016-04-04,
8388,1,"The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of pe .... The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of people who are considered successful in our society. From the world’s best hockey players to Steve Jobs, he concludes that success is ultimately the result of impeccable timing, cultural support, and lots of practice. The overall message of the book is that to become one of very few “outliers” in our society, people need much more than just talent. While practice is commonly regarded as the one and only way to perfection, Gladwell argues that there is a reason almost all of Canada’s best hockey players were born in January, February, and March. The random connections like this one fascinated me as I read the book. Outliers is undoubtedly a book that makes readers think. Gladwell doesn’t tell readers why the best hockey players were born at the beginning of the year, but instead, makes them try to figure it out themselves by offering data sets. After offering readers hints to figure out his enigmas, he finally reveals the answer which never failed to be unanticipated and compelling. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book. Readers are not only interested by the intriguing connections made by Gladwell, but also by the amazing, untold stories of some of the most successful humans in history. Gladwell's writing style is thought provoking and forces readers to think about everything differently. Have you ever wondered why some airlines are so much more prone to crashes than others? I certainly didn’t, but the answers to questions like these are surprising and not obvious. Gladwell’s amazing observations and questions enlighten readers and cause them to question the obvious explanations to everything. Overall, I would recommend this book to everybody. The fascinating stories and observations make the book a serious page turner and enthrall readers around the world.",2016-04-03,

8390,1,"I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommend .... I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommended to read this book in my survey Entrepreneurship course. This book discusses opportunities people have been given in order to succeed. Gladwell argues that it is not just innate qualities, talent, or a high IQ that makes someone succeed, but it is cultural heritage, work ethic, support from people, and someone’s attitude that enormously help someone succeed when taking opportunities.  like how the introduction of this book and the last chapter and epilogue all tie the book together to make it cohesive. The introduction of this book was very fascinating to me because it talked about how a group of people living in Roseto, Italy all lived long lives and it wasn’t because of genetics, it was all because of how these people lived and socialized in their culture that made them unique. I never knew something like this could occur. I also liked the ending of the last chapter that suggested more people need to become successful so it won’t just be a small amount of people making it to the top. This inspired me because it made me recognize that someone doesn’t have to say they made it despite their circumstances, but actually made it with the support of their cultural upbringing and circumstances and challenges they faced. One thing I would improve was chapter seven, “The Ethnic Theory of Plane crashes,” by taking out some of the meandering because it was a tad bit of a long and drawn out chapter. his book is useful to other Entrepreneur students because it provides a positive outlook and inspiration for those that may think they don’t have what it takes to be an entrepreneur.

8435,0,"Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ. Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ tests to write with sufficient understanding about the subject. For example he assumes that IQ scores from various tests are comparable. He does not seem to be aware that not all IQ tests have the same ceiling. Some tests have a ceiling of 165, others 180. So to say a person who scores 165 on one test has a lower IQ than a person who scores 180 on another test may be misleading. It is just as important to know which test was given as it is to know the test score. There is also the Standard Error of Measurement to factor in, which varies from test to test. Some tests give equal emphasis to verbal and non-verbal skills while others heavily weigh one or the other. Some tests are limited to a pencil and paper format while others have concrete objects to be manipulated, so similar skills are not being evaluated.  All tests have predetermined, correct answers so there is no way to evaluate creative, &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; thinking. For example, one IQ test may ask the question, &amp;quot;In what way are a child and a banana tree alike?&amp;quot;  The correct answer according to the manual would be that they are both organisms, living beings. But if the respondent answers &amp;quot;They both have 55% of the same genes&amp;quot;, the response could not be given credit. The ability to find creative, new and inventive ways of organizing information as Einstein was able to do can not be evaluated with IQ tests in their present form. So to say that Einstein only had an IQ of 150 does not mean he did not have exceptionally high intellectual functioning, it may tell us more about the limitations of the test. If a respondent is given an IQ test in his/her second language then it is at their disadvantage. Cultural differences also come into play, especially in vocabulary and in risk taking skills. Then there is the problem of psychological factors. People who are depressed tend to score significantly lower than their peers who are not depressed. And more fundamentally, there is the problem that intellectual functioning can not be measured in the brain as the activity happens. We can only imply from a test performance how efficiently, effectively the brain can solve problems.",2013-10-01,

Thank you friend for recommending this book.  &amp;quot;Outliers&amp;quot; is very interesting and proved to be thought provoking. The book is a result of his research on exceptionally successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others.  was always curious about how these people become so successful at their chosen careers and Mr. Malcolm will give you the explanations that comes with their successes. The book is not a &amp;quot;how to become an outlier&amp;quot; but it explains how some has achieved such success. t explains how successful hockey players are mostly born from January to March. That kids born earlier in the year are physically more developed and thus get noticed and given more opportunity to play and better coaching. Bill Gates and other software tycoons were born at the right time. They were in college when computers are just starting out. They seized the opportunity for computer time when the computer world was just young. Michael Jordan might be very tall but it is not just his height that made him such a successful player. Joe Flom a good Jewish lawyer, who was practicing business takeover law when nobody else was taking those cases. ntellect may be important but as the psychologist Lewis Terman followed high IQ children into adulthood, it shows that intellect and achievement are FAR from perfectly correlated. That one can have general and practical intelligence but it does not imply the presence of the other in all instances. High I.Q. kids with involved parents also contributed to their success in adulthood. he outliers possesses the combinations of being born at the right time and place, were given the extraordinary opportunity to put in the 10,000 hour rule to practice their crafts, has vision, talent and were in the right time and place. They were not just innately programmed to be a success, they put in hard work, lived in a community where their potentials were encourage and &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; was there at the right moment. n our everyday life scenario, does it mean we should prevent our kids from being the youngest in everything they do? Should we demand hours and hours of practice in the things they decide to play, be it in academics, sports, music and others?  have a friend whose kids all have close to 4.0 GPA, all excel at the extracurricular activities they joined. Is it just because they are genetically intelligent and talented? Or is it because of the cultural legacy of being a second generation Asian-American? But then, not all second generation Americans are Bill Gates in the making. Are all their waking moment spent in studying and practicing?

Circumstances and coincidences play a huge role in what makes someone succeed, especially in cases of extraordinary levels of achievement. Another major factor analyzed is practice. It has been found that anyone committing to 10,000 hours (which takes about 10 years out of a lifetime) of practice or dedicated work/study is most likely to excel in that field.

8491,1,"Outliers. Outliers &amp;ndash; Book Review he book, Outliers, is a very fascinating book written by Malcolm Gladwell. This book is about success and how some people succeed in certain areas and some just don&amp;rsquo;t. The success of these individuals goes way beyond individual merit. The factors of success are opportunities given, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule. These factors help people who are ordinary people become a billionaire or very successful in their profession. Gladwell explains how professional hockey players, lawyers, people with high IQ&amp;rsquo;s, Microsoft creators, etc. came to be so famous. Again, these factors are opportunities, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule. Opportunities given include factors such as wealth, the schools people went to, who their parents are, where they live, and also luck. Hidden advantages are something other people don&amp;rsquo;t see in these outliers just by looking at them. Such as the month they were born and their IQ score. And lastly did these certain individuals have enough time to practice their skills, the willingness to practice, or the motivation to work hard in order to reach their goals. I think everybody should read this book at some point in their life. It is an extremely book. It explains how some people succeed from factors other than individual merit. On the other hand, a lot of people who are very intelligent or skilled don&amp;rsquo;t succeed like they are supposed to, or lack of a better word, like they could have.

This is an eye-opening book that captivated and fascinated the minds of many readers. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, used his years of research and ingenious tone of conversation to shed some light onto concepts about success that people believe every day.  His main focus of the book is to describe how certain circumstances, timing, ethnicity/culture and work ethic make a person a successful outlier. He challenges every day thoughts of many people in believing how a person can achieve success. Gladwell basically says, here is the research and it keeps pointing back to the same conclusion. There are many more factors that contribute to success then meet the eyes. Gladwell uses many examples and scenarios to support his main arguments about why achieving success is such a complex process. As a reader, you are almost guaranteed to find a section of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book that will catch your attention. Few of the variety topics he talks about in Outliers are hockey, schooling, airplanes and computer programmers. These topics just barely scratch the surface of this revealing book. In the book, Gladwell has a writing style of telling a story and then evaluating and dissecting the story with a much closer look. It is really fascinating about how all Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s concepts intertwine and make clear the once blurry image of success. After reading this book, my overall opinion is that I encourage you to give it a try.

8497,1,"Great Book: Highly Recommended. My father had bought this book a few months ago and he recently recommended it to me. From first glancing at the cover, I was not very interested. I suspected the book would be a dull self-help book filled with tips on how to get rich and successful. To my immense delight, Outliers is far from a how-to manual. Malcolm Gladwell does not attempt to instruct his readers. Rather, he tries his best to explain why the common perception of successful people is severely flawed. People think that successful billionaires like Bill Gates achieved their triumphs single-handedly. Gladwell forces you, the reader, to delve far beyond their own personal efforts and skills; to look at the bigger picture. Gates, for example, was born in the perfect year. He was neither too young nor too old when he got into computer programming for him to be successful. Growing up in a wealthy household, Gates had the necessary resources. Additionally, he got unlimited access to the computers at the University of Washington when he was in college; He had far more programming experience than his peers of similar intelligence. Gladwell pulls out these seemingly insignificant factors but makes you believe that they, not his genius, are the reasons for his success. Among explanations for successful businessmen, Gladwell manages to throw in some really interesting observations. For instance, professional hockey players are predominantly born in January and Asian airline pilots are more likely to crash than American pilots. He emphasizes the influence of upbringing and cultural background when looking at success. The author relates the Chinese tradition of cultivating rice paddies with Chinese superiority in math. Though these claims can sound ridiculous, Gladwell elaborately explains his reasoning until it actually starts to make sense. Gladwell has a writing style that draws the audience in. I would highly recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell to anyone who possesses an open mind; anyone prepared to view success in a whole new light.",2012-01-17,
8498,1,"A great non-fiction read. In statistics, an outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the set of data. In Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book Outliers he uses the term to express anyone or anything whose achievements fall outside normal experience and follow a peculiar and unexpected logic. In terms of the nonfiction literature I have read recently, his book seems to be an outlier. The book is entertaining, captivating, and helpful.  have always been interested in those individuals who make it big, and become wildly successful. I always though to myself that these individuals must have been born for success. In Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book he investigates just that, and looks at the social, economical, and cultural elements that lead to the realization of and individual&amp;rsquo;s potential. The book looks into strange phenomena&amp;rsquo;s within the success of individuals. One of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players. They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year. This phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed. Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams. This is just one example of the factors Gladwell presents that attribute to success. t may seem that the book writes off pure hard work and determination, but Gladwell also presents the 10,000 hour rule. He gives examples of musical prodigies, the Beatles, and Bill Gates and explains that they only achieved greatness due to the &amp;ldquo;10,000&amp;rdquo; hours of practice they had in their field. his was a very thought provoking read. I would recommend this to anyone interested in psychology or the hidden factors that shape the world we live in. I enjoyed this book greatly.",2012-01-09,
8499,1,"Awesome book - intriguing and stimulating - a must read. The book Outliers by Maclcolm Gladwell is by far the best book that I have ever read. I absolutely recommend it to everyone, especially anyone with a curiosity or interest of success, psychology, or the influence of cultural backgrounds and atmosphere on an individual. t presents and develops ideas that provoke hours of thoughts on the subject of success. It further details, and truly exemplifies ideas that explain why Outliers such as the Beetles, Bill Gates, the Chinese, and others have obtained the great success that that have. he book is divided into two parts, Opportunity and Legacy. In Outliers, Gladwell manages to explain through thorough explanation of connections and patterns what leads to brilliant success. He illustrates how countless hours of hard work (10,000 at the minimum to be exact), and opportunity culminate to allow someone to exceed expectation. He disproves the thought that sheer brilliance is what it takes to become an outlier. ladwell explains throughout the book that &amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t rise from nothing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Success is not a random act&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;One doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be the smartest, simply smart enough&amp;rdquo;, and most importantly that &amp;ldquo;Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages&amp;rdquo;. his book navigates one through the influence of ones culture, atmosphere, gifted programs, opportunities, family, economic status, IQ, and religion on ones self. It explains how such influences lead one to something, and that to another thing, and that to another, and eventually lead one to success. Gladwell explains how these Outliers are a product of their environment and opportunities. ladwell is particularly effective as he supports all his claims with experiments and examples. urthermore, this book is extremely well put together. I truly couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to learn more, and that&amp;rsquo;s what you ultimately get from this book, knowledge. It even aroused a great amount of conversation.",2012-01-08,
8500,1,"A Must Read!. I have always been inquisitive about the lives of ones who make it to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the many other prestigious schools, the professional sport players, and the multi-making billionaires. For years, I stuck with the notion that they were just born this way with some unique, innate ability. I also viewed these individuals as &amp;ldquo;the lucky ones&amp;rdquo;; to me, these people came around every once in a while. Though just as I thought no ordinary person can achieve such a high status, Malcolm Gladwell proves me wrong. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell takes these common ideas and challenges each of them, showing society that the successful people aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;chosen ones&amp;rdquo; after all. hroughout the first couple of pages, Gladwell discusses the lives of professional hockey players. Almost everyone believes that they play at the pro level because they are just naturally good at the sport. However, through research, we learn that about 90 percent of these players are born sometime during the first four months of the year. Coincidence? No, this is rather the result of the cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada being January 1. &amp;ldquo;The benefit of critical extra months of maturity,&amp;rdquo; simply gives these individuals better coaching, much more practice then they would normally receive, and their teammates are ultimately better; this all allows them to eventually become professional players. Although talent is something greatly needed, it is not the major deciding factor in a player&amp;rsquo;s life. ext, Gladwell talks about Bill Gates and The Beatles, showing that their road to victory is not what we thought after all. We find out that they both accomplished 10,000 hours of practice at early ages; causing them to be the successful people we know them to be. Each of them was certainly gifted, but the extraordinary opportunities they faced are what differentiate between them. The Beatles were requested in Hamburg for the most casual reasons. Bill Gates just happened to be in a school known as Lakeside at the very right time. It is through the story of men like these and other people that I learned that we can never make it in this world alone; there are many factors that greatly affect our future. At the end of this part in the novel, Gladwell makes it clear that we should seize any opportunity, no matter how big or small, because that opportunity may be the one key to our triumph. Not only that, but an adversity can at times form into a huge opportunity. utliers even goes to argue that it matters where a pilot was born because that determines their success. He also argues the success of Asians at math in terms of how they grow up learning the subject. Gladwell tackles many topics and presents the flaws in society&amp;rsquo;s mindset in a very logical and sophisticated manner. All his ideas are supported with plentiful amount of research. I highly recommend this book to everyone. We are in an era where people are classified as either successful or unsuccessful and the successful ones are seen as the &amp;ldquo;special ones.&amp;rdquo; In reality, though, everyone has a shot at becoming victorious.",2012-01-07,

8517,1,"A really good read!!. ""Outliers"", by Malcom Gladwell. This book goes into a great amount of detail explaining why some people excel at what they do and why others do not. The premise is that someone or group of someones or a something can be so far out of the ordinary that it would be considered an outlier. If you are familiar with statistics, an outlier lies far outside the mean While most data will be grouped within the 1st 2 standard deviations of the mean, an outlier isn't anywhere close. An outlier can be either negative or positive. In this book, most of the outliers Gladwell speaks of are positive. He uses different situations to illustrate his concept and proposes that most successful people are not successful simply because of natural born talent, but because they worked at it. He suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice for a person to become so good at what they do that they might excel in the field. In addition, these people may have been exposed to ""extraordinary opportunities, hidden advantages, and cultural legacies that allowed them to learn, work hard and make sense of the world in ways that others could not"" (p. 19). Or did not. In addition, when and where a person is born also influences greatness, but it alone cannot account for why some people fly beyond the bounds of the ordinary and others do not.

8521,0,"Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.. I also found the data employed in this chapter to be misleading. Considering how few people have the IQs you reference, it is essentially impossible to get enough data to make reliable conclusions. Just because factors like emotional intelligence matter should not discount the value of actual or intellectual intelligence. In fact, if IQ is such a crude measurement system (which most people realize), then why use it at all to ""prove"" your theory? The idea that Einstein's level of intelligence was not that important to his success simply disregards reality. Unfortunately, this chapter, with its labored attempts to prove that we all have what it takes - that the smart kids are no better - seems to me like a bit of sophistry that once again makes people feel better about themselves and has undoubtedly resulted in the widespread embrace of this book in our school system that is soft and overly-sensitive when it comes to success and failure. he ideas explained in ""The Matthew Effect"" did seem to hold some water, however, and I could relate. My school district has an enrichment program that tests students to see if they are eligible in the early years of elementary school. Once in the program, you basically do not leave. Not that we are in high school, it is very clear that many of the students in the program do not belong there. At the time we were tested, age certainly made a difference. In fact, for the first several years of the program, I remember that all of the students in it (myself included) were among the oldest in their respective grades. This was probably the best chapter in the book, as you backed up your claims very well. While reading it, I questioned whether I still belong in the enrichment program many times. It was an interesting point to make, and it did give me a bit of a new perspective. espite the aspects of the book I did not like, I do appreciate that you attempt to answer the question of success. Frankly, I feel that it is unanswerable. It certainly is a fascinating topic. incerely, ichael Gildin",2011-03-30,
8522,0,"Senior English Letter to the Author. Mr. Gladwell, y Senior English class has just recently read your book Outliers. The focus of our class and its curriculum is to pursue an essential question and apply it to our studies to give us greater perspective. The particular question my class must evaluate throughout the semester is ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Your book has been an excellent choice for the class, as it reflects upon the themes of time and place quite often. Throughout the book, you elaborate upon the idea that talent is not necessarily an innate quality in and of itself. Instead, you stress that often luck is a factor, mainly in the form of a person's timing or the culture they come from. Outliers are more often than not the result of elements that are out of their control, as you explain. ne chapter that stood out to me was ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" This chapter highlighted the necessity of hard work in achieving success, but it was interesting and surprising that you assigned a specific number to it. The examples of Bill Gates and the Beatles explained your point. For Bill Gates, in particular, the themes of time and place fit very well. He was born at such a time that computers were just becoming more of a present force when Gates reached maturity. Random events allowed him to have essentially uninterrupted access to high-end technology, which was further made possible by the lack of large-scale computer fluency during this time. Were Gates born at a different time or place, he would not have had access to all of these tools and advantages that allowed him to complete his 10,000 hours (even though the explanations provided did seem a bit revisionist). Practice does make perfect, I guess.  had a difficult time connecting with the chapter ""Marita's Bargain."" It seemed as though the stress Marita faced was being pushed as a positive. For disadvantaged students such as her, I do agree that the KIPP schools do a great job of making them rise above their socio-economic situations. However, do you feel that this sufficiently addresses the problem? To me, it seems more like a band-aid. I feel that a lot of the point of this chapter was strained in order to get across to us that underprivileged children are still smart. Which is not to say that isn't true - it is just overstated in this chapter. I also find it curious that in the case of children like Marita, time and place suddenly does not matter. How is she able to overcome her disadvantages and inherent ""bad luck"" so easily? You offer a rather politically correct explanation, something that people in our time (especially those higher on the socioeconomic ladder) love to hear in order to feel better about themselves. I am a huge supporter of education and equal opportunity for everyone, but even I thought this chapter felt a little forced.  also found myself disagreeing with the ideas presented in the chapter on IQ. Your essential argument is that intelligence is not really a factor in success beyond a certain point, and in fact that it is not really a deciding factor at all. The example of Christopher Langan's genius-level IQ but strangely ""unsuccessful"" life is interesting, but it is merely an anecdote that I do not believe can be the basis for the sweeping generalities you make. The chapter seemed guilty of forcibly adapting the theory once the necessary outlier had been found. (Cont. in next review)",2011-03-30,
8523,1,"Letter to the Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell, n our English class we have been studying topics of religion, diversity, and age while constantly asking ourselves the essential question, ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Throughout your book, time and place were referenced multiple times as characteristics of an outlier. The most obvious reference being the chapter of 10,000 hours. Each professional whom you interviewed each estimated they had spent 10,000 hours honing there skills, whether it be in programming or singing, before they were considered experts by others. Another reference from your book to our essential question was the chapter on Harlan, Kentucky. A place where culture crafted ones creativity, personality, and even length of life! The members of this community understand hard-work on a different level than other citizens of America at the time. A third, but certainly not final reference from your book to our essential question, is the first chapter on the Matthew Effect. In this chapter both time and place effect each member of high-performance teams. They had been born around January 1st, giving them a slight age advantage. They also were born into an area where hockey was thought of highly. Your book took a seemingly vague question and answered it multiple times; time and place effect a persons entire life from his first breath to his last. hank you, ustin",2011-03-29,
8524,1,"An interesting look at the meaning of success. Mr. Gladwell, I am currently a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School, and am in Senior English. In Senior English, as in all English classes, we have a central question that all our units and lessons revolve around that structures what we should be taking away from the course. In Senior English, our question is: to what extent do time and place define a person? Your book, Outliers, is the first book we read in the class, and you can probably guess as to why your book was chosen to fit in with our curriculum. Your book perfectly demonstrated how time and place can affect, and in some cases, completely determine the success of an individual. One of my favorite chapters was the one about the 10,000 hour rule. I liked that you pointed out that talent doesn't come to anyone without putting in a large amount of work in. Growing up I was involved in many activities, but I never stuck with any of them because I saw other kids who were better at them than I was and I assumed talent at a particular skill was something a person is either born with or not. It never occurred to me that maybe those kids invested more time into their skill than I did. It was also pretty amazing to learn that even people like Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and The Beatles had to put in 10,000 hours before they were able to be at the top of their field. Another chapter I enjoyed was the one about the Matthew effect. It was interesting to learn how the date of birth of an athlete can affect his or her chances of doing well in his or her sport and making it to a professional league. I feel bad for the hockey players that could have been good if only they had been given a little extra time to grow and develop, like the players whose birthdays fell right after the cutoff date. The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy is very interesting; that something false can evoke a behavior that makes the falsehood seem true. I can relate to this chapter because the cutoff for kindergarten in my school district is early September, and I was born in late August. I am usually the youngest in my class, and one of the youngest in my grade. Sometimes I was not as quick in school because my brain was not as developed as the kids in my grade who were born in September or October. I also liked the chapter about the Asian rice paddies. There has always been the stigma that Asians are better at math, but I never knew where the stigma came from. This chapter pointed out that Asians' talent for math comes from their culture with rice paddies. I liked this chapter, along with others, that demonstrated that a person's cultural background can influence their success. The idea that who your ancestors are can determine if you achieve a lot or a little is fascinating. Outliers was an interesting book to read, and it made me think about what the true meaning of success was, and by what means people reached success. I enjoyed the book, and I think it added a lot to our English curriculum. Sincerely, Michelle Lineberger",2011-03-29,
8525,1,"Letter to Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a high school student and in my English class we are studying and analyzing the essential question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The purpose of this question is to understand what it takes to be successful in the ""real"" world. Your book could not answer this question better than it already does. Time and place can drastically impact a person's successfulness as portrayed in this book. Three particular chapters that exemplify this are The Matthew Effect, The 10,000 Hour Rule, and Harlan, Kentucky.  found the Matthew Effect to be very interesting. The connections shown in this chapter completely shocked me and I made me realize just how true they are. It tells of a Canadian all-star hockey team. The players on the team had a natural advantage over kids their age though, because of the cut off dates. With how they fell, the bigger and older boys naturally had more ability, therefore giving them an unfair advantage over the other boys in their birth year. This chapter gives an example of how time and place gave the hockey players greater opportunities than some of the other ones. I definitely agree with this chapter completely, even though I never even realized it was happening. The question that this chapter left me with was if the same situation happens with school and grades today. he next chapter, The 10,000 Rule, was the one that I found to be the most interesting and informative. The idea is that a person cannot perfect a skill until they have had 10,000 hours of practice put into it. I agree with this rule. It seems like an extreme number, but if you think about it; it really does make sense why it would be so high. And how can someone not be perfect at a skill after 10,000 hours? Time needs to be sacrificed and given in order to achieve what the person wants to achieve. he last chapter, Harlan, Kentucky was intriguing. It made me see culture in a different aspect. The idea that place could have that much affect on a person's personality and perspective about everything is interesting. I agree with the idea of the chapter, though, again, I never gave it much consideration before reading this book. It makes me wonder how this idea could have affected my family and point of view.  lot of the stories in the book relate to me in some way or another and that is what makes it such a great read.

8526,1,"Senior English. (Cont.) Although I found most of your answers to quite reasonable, I found that your explanation regarding the ""Matthew Effect,"" was quite general. I don't believe that being older necessarily makes you better at something. After all, in the context of hockey players, the older kids are only older by a couple of months. However, I did agree with the fact that our society focuses too much on initial success and we naturally write off those who don't experience initial success as failures. As a result, we do tend to make the successful more successful while those who initially fail, continue to fail due to lack of resources and opportunities. This fact applies to students in school. At our school we have enrichment programs that selectively help the kids who initially showed talent in elementary school. However, as we grow older, I see that there are people not in enrichment that are smarter than some kids who are in it. verall, I found Outliers to be a thought provoking book that addressed situations and questions that we as a society often wonder about. The book is outstanding regarding the fact that it teaches us to analyze with logic and rational. As I have mentioned before, it is the perfect book to address our essential question. incerely, erry Lee",2011-03-28,
8527,1,"Senior English. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School. For our English class this year, we read Outliers: The Story of Success. Outliers seemed like the perfect book to evaluate our essential question; to what extent do time and place define a person? The purpose of having an essential question is to promote greater levels of thinking, which, in turn allows us to evaluate situations with a new perspective that looks beyond the obvious. The information presented in Outliers was perfect for our English course because it evaluated each situation with a deeper outlook. For instance, instead of coming to the conclusion that Korean pilots are naturally inclined to crash planes, the book evaluated reasons such as Power Indexes, and different cultures' tolerance for ambiguity. It is logical process of evaluating all aspects of a situation before jumping to conclusion that makes Outliers relevant to our course of study. hile reading the book, I found some of the presented answers to be illuminating while I found others to be overly general. For instance, Chapter 2 discussed the 10,000-Hour Rule, which I found to be rather interesting because it explained why people like Bill Gates are successful. Many of us often wonder what it takes to be next Bill Gates and I found it surprising that the answer is practice. My dad, like most parents, is always telling me that practice makes perfect. I've always found it hard to believe that practice is all it takes but I have to admit that, after reading Outliers, it does make sense. When I used to play violin, I found that the best violinists were the ones who practiced a lot. They were the ones that took lessons early in their childhood and as a result, they are able to accumulate many practice hours. However, I am glad you pointed out that other factors like opportunity and time play a role in determining success. he chapter that I found most insightful was Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, in which you discussed a theory on why Asians are so good at math. As an Asian, I was really glad that you chose to address this topic because many of my friends subscribe to the misconception that Asians are naturally good at math. I have always wondered; why exactly are Asians good at math but time after time, I have failed to procure a reasonable answer. I was almost convinced that maybe Asians are just naturally good at math when I read your book. I found it rather interesting that there was a correlation between hard work in the rice paddies and one's ability to do math. Reflecting back, it makes perfect sense because those in my school who are the best at math are the ones who don't give up. I was also surprised that you related math and language. I tested your theory that the Chinese language makes it easier to memorize numbers, by asking my dad to repeat numbers in Chinese and it turns out that he could remember them. On the other hand, I could not when I repeated the numbers in English. (Cont. on next review)",2011-03-28,
8528,1,"Outliers Letter to the Editor - Senior English. Mr. Gladwell, It was a pleasure reading Outliers, which is one of the more interesting books that I have ever read in school. My teacher chose Outliers as a class reading because it ties in really well with the essential question of our senior English course; the essential question is, ""to what extent does time and place define a person."" Before reading this book, I agreed that time and place can affect one's life; however, I never thought that it could have such a drastic effect on one's success. In Chapter 4, when you told the story of Christopher Langan, I was shocked to read that such a brilliant man like Langan can have such a disappointing future. In Outliers, you mentioned that practical intelligence is ""a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills are from our families"" (Gladwell 102). I found it really interesting that the most important factor in one's success is the environment one was raised in and not the level of analytical intelligence or IQ one possesses. It is something that is totally out of one's control, yet it still has such a dramatic effect. This quote really made me reflect on how I was raised as a child. I questioned my parents' parenting techniques and debated whether or not I have acquired this practical intelligence. As I kept on reading, the KIPP program that you talked about really caught my interest. Giving children who wouldn't otherwise get the chance to learn that much and get a better shot at college and a suitable job is awesome. Everyone deserves an opportunity like that. In a way, I had my ""KIPP"" program because I grew up in Philadelphia but my parents were able to send me to private school and not a filthy public school. The chapter that talked about plane pilots also caught my attention. I agree with you that your background may affect how you perform in serious situations. Americans know not to be passive especially when something is wrong, but someone from Spain or Colombia may be passive to the pilot because they are in command. This idea shows place can affect one's work and even life. Through the years though I think many are beginning to overcome this barrier. Overall, I believe you answered the essential question really well and all your ideas were very well explained and supported with great evidence. Therefore, I do not have any misunderstandings about the novel; however, I did at times think the novel got a bit repetitive. I got the concept quickly and wanted more but you gave me the same information just worded differently. The book really gives you a new perspective on how every little thing can control one's success. It is really interesting and once again it was a pleasure reading Outliers.

8529,1,"VERY GOOD!. Dear Malcom Gladwell, our novel is a very though provoking journey through what it means to be successful. In my 12th grade senior English class we have a question that is suppose to help guide us throughout the course, that question is how does time and place define who a person is? It is, of course, obvious to see here how your novel fits in with this theme. Overall three sections resonated with me the most, Maria's Chapter, The 10,000 hour chapter and the Section about Rosetta. he chapter with Maria resonated with me very deeply because I just as Maria come from a disadvantaged home and I believe I have been through a part of what she has been through. My community is not anywhere near as ""bad"" as Maria's but my neighborhood is right up there with drug use, violence and illiteracy. I know only one neighbor of mine who has attended a University. I see everyday what can happen if one begins to lose focus of how to become successful. I do not have to work nearly as hard as Maria to become successful because my community school is more then adequate but I can defiantly see where she is coming from. he chapter about Rosetta really opened my eyes to how truly important time and place is to a person. In this chapter it becomes obvious that time and place are affecting these peoples health, in a positive way. It is impossible for a person in the 21st century to truly believe that a person can stay healthy simply because they are surrounded by people who care about them yet this is what this section proves. This section really opened my eyes to the influences that affect me everyday that I had no idea affected me everyday. he 10,000 hour chapter really drove home the importance of hard work and and determination in success. I had always thought that success came mostly from God given gifts and only slightly from hard work. I thought people like Bill Gates or The Beatles were products of luck, they could just roll out of bed and be better then anybody in the world at what they do. After reading this chapter, of course, I realized my assumptions were incorrect. Theses men were better then everyone else because they had worked longer and harder then everyone else plus they did have a little talent. Overall the book as a whole taught me that life will give you a chance to succeed you just need to be prepared when the moment presents itself and the only way to be prepared it through hard work. hank You, ick dovidio",2011-03-28,
8530,1,"Highly Recommended - a definite read!. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  recently read your book Outliers for an assignment for my senior English class and found it very applicable to my class's essential question. The essential question varies depending on what grade the students are in and basically serves as the central theme for the entire course. This year, my class's essential question is, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" I have to admit that I did not really believe that our essential question had very much depth to it this year; I assumed that the answer was plain and simple. However, upon reading your book Outliers, I came to realize exactly how much time and place can affect a person. rom my understanding, the point that you set out to make in this book was that success is not inherent and that any one person's success can be traced back to a variety of factors. In order to prove this point, you take the reader through a variety of stories such as those of Mort Janklow, Chris Langan, and even Asian math students. In all of these stories, the importance of time and place stood out to me. For Mort Janklow, time was imperative to his success because it allowed him to find a job. In the cases of Chris Langan and Asian math students, it seemed that location was more important to their success than time was. While family environment influenced Chris, and cultural environment influenced Asian math students, it is obvious that their locations were determining factors in their successfulness. CONT.

8531,1,"David G's Review - FANTASTIC NOVEL :) (review is cutoff because of the stupid character limit). Dear Mr. Gladwell, s part of the senior English curriculum in my high school, I was required to read your book Outliers: The Story of Success. I was particularly intrigued when I found out about our assignment because earlier in the year, I had read your novel The Tipping Point in my psychology class. Your stimulating, interactive, and interesting writing style caught my attention with The Tipping Point, so I knew I would enjoy Outliers before I even read it. Part of the reason that we read your book was because it tied in perfectly with our essential question, """"To what extent do time and place define a person?"" After finishing the novel, it was evident that time and place play such a significant role in defining a person. From the chapter ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes, which I thought was one of the strongest in your book, you explored the reason behind the mysterious statistic in the late 90s, in which Korean Airlines had too many crashes. I never really thought about the reasoning behind a plane crash; I assumed it was due to plane malfunction, but your research suggests it is typically due to human malfunction instead. The Korean Airlines planes were of fine quality - the Korean culture was the problem. It was stressed in Korean culture not to challenge or question a higher authority, so when a co-pilot saw a severe problem, it was difficult for him or her to relay the message to the pilot, thus resulting in a crash. For the passengers on the planes that crashed, their tragic endings were a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can relate this chapter to the helicopter/plane midair collision over the Hudson River in August of 2009, in which several of our family friends were killed. Their deaths, like those of the Korean Airlines passengers in the late 90s, were a result of human error, in which the air traffic controller was on the phone joking about a dead cat. The effects that all of the crashes had on both the victims and their families are immeasurable and are still being felt today. Another one of my favorite chapters was ""The Matthew Effect."" It was fascinating to know that someone's birth date can have such a large impact on his or her future. I only had thought of birthdays as a fun yearly ""event"", but now I realize that they are the cause for many advantages and disadvantages. For example, most sports have a cutoff date; in soccer, that cutoff date is September 1. Some soccer players will naturally be more mature than their counterparts will because they have the birthday advantage, and this benefit will stay with them throughout their soccer career. This may seem unfair, but it reasserts what seems to be a theme of Outliers: ""Timing can be critical to an outlier's success."" My birthday is on September 1, which is typically the academic cutoff date as well. I hope that I can take advantage of ""The Matthew Effect"", and become an outlier academically in the future. The chapter The 10,000-Hour Rule, was the most appealing and innovative chapters in the entire book. 10,000 hours of work in a particular field are needed for a chance at mastery and expertise. I liked how the Beatles were one of the main examples in this chapter, because I grew up listening to them, and they are my favorite band today. I never realized that many musicians have had their songwriting and musical abilities; they just failed to capitalize on their talents, which is what sets the Beatles apart. In every subject, t",2011-03-28,
8532,1,"Definitely food for thought. In my English class we are exploring the question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" It's an interesting question, and Gladwell's book, Outliers answers it well. The book offers incredible insight on success and why people, not just outliers, are the way they are. The theme ""success is the result of a person's upbringing and opportunities"" is laced throughout the book. A person may have an IQ of 160, but this does not guarantee success. Yes, Bill Gates had incredible natural abilities, but it was because the school he attended had a high-tech computer room that he achieved success. Gladwell's own mother owes her success to being in the right place at the right time-she obtained a scholarship in Jamaica, and had she been born 3 or 4 years earlier that opportunity would not have existed. Time and place do not just influence a person, they define him. ne chapter of Outliers I found particularly interesting was Rice Paddies and Math Tests. Being of Asian descent, many people have stereotyped me, commenting that I must be good at math or really smart. What's interesting about Gladwell is that he does not try to deny the claim or apologize for it-he justifies it. Many Asians actually are good at math, but it is not because they have more intelligence; it has to do with being raised in a culture where patience and perseverance determine whether a family will have food to eat. I do agree that Asians, as well as any other ethnic group, have different cultures and perceptions of success. Gladwell's book is one huge generalization, and it has to be. But I find it interesting that I am of Asian and European descent, and my father's family, who is white, has much higher standards than my mother's. ladwell claims that a person will become an expert at something, anything, after devoting 10000 hours to the cause. It makes me think, Will someone who spends 10,000 hours playing soccer but does not put in maximum effort be more successful than a player who dedicates 5000 hours of blood, sweat and tears to becoming great? Can someone become an expert before the 10000 hour mark? I agree that time is important to become good at anything. My band teacher always says, ""Practice does not make perfect; practice makes permanent"". So will a clarinet player who plays poorly for 10,000 hours become an expert awful clarinet player? ladwell brought up an interesting point in the chapter The Trouble with GeniusesPt. 2. Chris Langan is a genius but never lives to his full potential. He drops out of college and ends up leading a happy yet conventional life. Robert Oppenheimer, on the other hand is not as smart as Langan, yet his perseverance and social skills make him one of the most successful and revolutionary men in the world. It makes me think, Are people wasting their abilities? Some of my peers are extremely intelligent, but do not have a spectacular work ethic. Given perseverance, they could all do great things, but many do not want to. Should they be pushed and forced to succeed? Is it more important to do whatever makes you happy? Outliers accredits many third parties with determining other people's successes, but to what extent does a person himself define his success? utliers was definitely food for thought. I t changed my perceptions of the world and success. I recommend this book to anyone who questions, Why? constantly and although the information may not be ground-breaking and extreme, it is thought-provoking.",2011-03-28,
8533,1,"Recommended. Mr. Gladwell, Your book Outliers: The Story of Success was a very good read and it provided me with a new perspective on a topic that is widely referenced. Everyone has heard about the stories where someone goes from rags to riches, but you completely changed the way people think about success stories. Many people believe that it takes only pure ambition and talent to be successful, but you realized that there is way more to it than that. In ""The Trouble with Geniuses, Part II"", you showed that having a higher intelligence than someone else does not increase your chances of being successful. Being in school it is hard to understand how being naturally intelligent does not help because all of the awards and accolades are given to the smartest and strongest. However, the example of Langan and Oppenheimer showed me how some outliers in these award ceremonies came to be successful because they have charisma that others do not possess. Many people overlook these seemingly obvious occurrences, but your ability to convey this method has forever changed my opinion about success. In the class that we read this book in, we have an essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The goal of this essential question is to help us make connections to the things that we do in class and I can honestly say that Outliers provides the best answer to this question. Throughout every chapter you showed a new and different way to explain how success is a result of where someone is at, with two of the best examples found in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" The importance of birthdays as they pertain to sports had never once crossed my mind, but knowledge that I gained from reading your explanation in ""The Matthew Effect"" shows how much they affect success. The fact that some players will be naturally more mature based on cut off dates for specific sports seems unfair, but just proves the point that sometimes success comes from a little luck and opportunity. This chapter caught my attention because growing up I played a lot of sports and now I wonder to what extent did my birthday play in determining how successful I was. In ""The 10,000-Hour Rule"" you discussed two things that I love those being computer programming and the Beatles. This chapter contained the same theme of being born at the right time by discussing how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were in the perfect age range for when society began to become more technological, but it also showed how where someone is located affects success. Given that Bill Joy and Bill Gates were located near some of the few advanced computer terminals of the time and the Beatles were given long stints in a club in Germany, it is no surprise that they were able to succeed because along with their natural talent they were given opportunities to practice in places that allowed them to perfect their craft. Overall I feel like this book was one of the most interesting and thought provoking books that I have ever read. The amount of research that you had to put into this book is incredible given some of the hidden messages that you have found in a variety of things like why a group of people are lawyers at the same time. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that you put into this book because it really did change the way that I look at things. Sincerely, Ryan Crim",2011-03-28,
8534,1,"Dear Malcome Gladwell. Dear Malcome Gladwell,  am currently a senior at Hatboro Horsham High School, and for English class we were assigned to read your book, it was actually our first assignment. See this course is structured around one essential question: In what ways do place and time impact a person? So the theme of your book fit in quite well. Our class discusses a bit more then just what impacts success, but the examples in the book were intriguing. ersonally my favorite chapter was chapter nine, Maritas Bargain. This story really inspired me. I think it's safe to say that everyone in the world has the desire to be successful at something; it could be big or small. But not everyone is willing to work hard in order to achieve success. The level of commitment and hard work this little girl puts in on a day to day basis is magnificent. It made me reevaluate how much effort I put into my daily activities, and made me want to work harder. hapter two was another one of my favorites. Before I even read the book I'd heard about the 10,000 hour rule and the idea made a lot of sense to me. I believe that practice really does make perfect. I don't think anyone can get truly good at something without putting in hours of hard work. Sometimes when I look back I wish that I had spent a little more time practicing things, like soccer or drawling. Who knows how good I might be right now if I had spent 10,000 hours practicing. But then again maybe I'm accumulating hours for something that is not quite as ordinary, and I don't even realize. astly there was chapter three, the trouble with geniuses. This wasn't one of my favorite chapters, but I do think many of the points you made were fascinating. When I think of the stereotypical vision in my head for someone who is successful I automatically think of someone who is incredibly smart. But being smart isn't everything, and I agree with the fact that there are different kinds of smart. I believe creativity is also important to becoming successful. And for that reason I am thankful that I have a creative side. Even though I'm only in high school I have seen this in action. A lot of the things we do in school require a basic knowledge, but what really makes one students work stand out from another's is their creativity. And frankly sometimes the smartest person in the group isn't the one who ends up doing well.  hope one day I will be an outlier; that my success will make me standout from the crowd. And when I look back and remember reading your book I can apply some of the points you made to my own success. So thank you for writing such a fascinating book and if you read this thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to my opinions, and I hope to read some of your other books in my future because I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",2011-03-28,
8535,1,"Mediocre. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was a very interesting read. I did not know what to expect when I first picked it up. I saw that that it said it was the ""story of success"" and was very intrigued in how Gladwell would approach this topic. The first chapter really made my head spin and convinced me that Gladwell knew what he was talking about. It truly made me retrace my steps growing up and thinking about how I was raised and how I could have been raised differently (not that I would want to be at all). Gladwell harks on the idea that when you were born is most important to your success but there were flaws right away in that this was not consistent with things outside of sports or in America. I do not believe that his philosophy on who were the faces of the Industrial Revolution of America was valid at all. Throughout the book Gladwell seems to continually look past the hard work of many and instead replace it with fate and environment which is not fair to those who worked hard for what they have. Gladwell also dismisses those who are successful in their lives that have not gone through the ""10,000 Hour Rule"". In that chapter Gladwell describes only people who have experienced financial success therefore it is very opinionated to what success is in Gladwell's mind. An example of success that is not financial is Mother Theresa who helped thousands throughout her life and devoted her life to the success of others. She may have worked at what she did for 10,000 hours but experienced an entirely different type of success. Altogether, there are far too many loopholes in Gladwell's work and he is too quick to dismiss success of people who do not fit into his pigeonhole. I would give this book three stars out of five because although it is biased, Gladwell still makes points about stories that are true and interesting to think about but most, such as Bill Gates, are one in a million and a special case.",2011-03-28,
8536,1,"Highly Recommended (letter to author). ""Outliers"" has directly related to my essential question for my senior English course. In my class our essential question is ""To what extent do time and place define a person"". The purpose of our essential question is for us to take a close look on the things around us and realize the importance of time and place. In your book this question is answered in almost every chapter. In the epilogue you tell us about the story of your mother and how she became successful. The events in her life directly related to our question because without the men and women who influenced the scholarships for Jamaican children in that time period you mother might have not been able to attend college. The epilogue for me was one of the best chapters because of the way the story was told and how well the chapter was structured to explain every facture that influenced and defined how your mother came to be successful. I also believe that chapter 6 on Harlan, Kentucky was a very intriguing chapter. The information in the chapter made me look at cultures within the United States differently, in a more understanding way. Also it made me realize that many of my southern relatives had the culture of honor. Also I found the 10,000 hours chapter a fascinating chapter. I liked how you showed many different successful people in totally different occupations, and how those people were living examples of the 10,000 hour rule. One of my favorite parts in that chapter was when you went into detail about the Beatles success story. I enjoyed this because the music industry now days it doesn't required a lot of practice to get acknowledged, but to do what the Beatles did takes an overwhelming amount of talent and I personally wish that many of the other artist out there would learn from the Beatles story and see that hard work and practice pays of rather than using technology to improve your music. Overall Mr. Gladwell I just would like to say that this book is amazing book and that it is one of my favorites. Each page of the book kept me attentive and made me want to continue reading to absorb more and more information about the people around us. Thank you very much for writing this book Mr. Gladwell.",2011-03-28,
8537,0,"Interesting, but discouraging. The ideas and facts presented by Gladwell in Outliers are interesting and intensely thought provoking. However, there is a tendency to feel mildly disheartened by the theme of the necessity of opportunities and the large rejection of the idea of ""The American dream."" This happens largely in the first part of the book: ""Opportunity"". The first chapter discusses the accumulation of opportunities as a result of each other starting with something as simple as birthdate. The second half discusses the effect of a legacy set before us that is unchangeable and again could decide our future despite our having no control over it. Gladwell's method of mixing story telling with analysis and facts is impressive and keeps the book interesting, but the occasion undertone of condescension can be distracting. Having read his other book The Tipping Point and enjoying it greatly I was a little disappointed by Outliers, but nonetheless found Gladwell's ideas interesting despite feeling slightly depressed by it.",2011-03-28,
8538,1,"Letter to the Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your terrific book ""Outliers"" I wanted to talk about some of the topics discussed in the book. Overall, the book had some very strong connections showing how time and place affect a person's success. (This therefore makes them outliers) How time and place affect a person is my English IV class' essential question. The essential question's purpose is to offer connections between many different texts and show how they can all relate to one another. Many topics you have made in your book, such as Jewish lawyers, geniuses and plane crashes all relate back to our essential question. he Three Lessons of Joe Flom was a very informative chapter. I found it to be a good example of karma because the Jews were given negligible law cases in the 1950's, but when those cases turned out to be valuable, the Jews were experts at them. Time is a defining element of success throughout your book. For example, I agree with your insight about Mort Janklow and how he was given the opportunity to succeed because of when he was born. (In comparison with his Father) A question comes to mind after reading this chapter. Are there any advantages to being born in 1992? This is when I was born and I wonder if there are any built in advantages here. he Trouble with Geniuses Part II is equally an interesting chapter. I have always wondered how much IQ has to do with how smart a person really is. You have cleared up the question and I have learned more about IQ then I have ever known before. I agree with your comparison of Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer. Langan lacks social skills and practical sense, while still being a genius. Oppenheimer had the social skills and was a genius, which allowed him to be innovative and extremely successful in his career. I question why Chris Langan was not as successful. Many people have weak social skills and a much lower IQ and are still successful. With his IQ, I would imagine he could easily overcome his inadequacies. he Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes was probably the most interesting chapter I read in your book. It was stunning to see that there is actually a difference between cultures that could actually lead up to something catastrophic, such as a plane crash. After reading about index power ratings and other information, I totally understand how differences in place could affect how one interprets their language. Do you think there is any where else we could apply this index rating? If so I would love to hear about it because I think it could really help understand the differences that time and place have on society. his book has helped me think about why I am who I am. There is so much more to think about that you have helped me to unlock. Maybe I could be better at math if I was Asian. Maybe I have a culture of honor engraved in me and I just don't know it. Many of your topics relate to my life and I question really why things happen. I now know what it means to be an outlier and how the outliers truely got to where they are. incerely, ohn S.",2011-03-28,
8539,1,"Exciting and entertaining!. In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, Mr. Gladwell explains various different situations and stories of success that have happened in the past millenium. This book reminded me of the many success stories that happen in people's lives, and provided some background about how these people became successful. Throughout the novel, Gladwell stresses one of his major points which was ""The Matthew effect"" which explained being born in the right time and place. He talks about Canadian hockey players that have a birthday between January- March usually end up being the most successful out of the players that are born in that year. I don't think that being born in a specific month then it has being born in another month. A person born in January and a person born in September can both be equally successful even if a person was born earlier. While some good players are born in these months, he does not give a clear explanation on the certain variables that causes the early-born athletes to perform better. Another one of his points that Gladwell explains in this novel was the ""10,000 hour rule"". I have always heard of the phrase ""practice makes perfect"", and was curious as to how Gladwell would have explained it. He states that in order to be a professional, you must spend at least 10,000 hours practicing and polishing your art. He gives many famous examples of professionals who have followed this rule and become professionals. I just found it intriguing that such successful people such as Bill Gates and The Beatles followed this rule to be successful. I was always curious to see how Bill Gates became one of the most successful CEOs in the world and Gladwell explained about the dedication and work ethic that he had in order to succeed. One example is the famous rock band The Beatles. The Beatles's story about how they constantly practiced and played their gigs for many hours a day, and thrived as musical prodigies for playing for about 10,000 hours. I was wondering if the way you deal with practice might have an effect on the 10,000 rule and becoming successful? After the chapter about the 10,000 rule, Gladwell elaborated on the story about Asians being good at math and their cultivating rice patties. He talks about how the Asians had ancestors who worked extremely long hours to absorb ""perseverance"" and ""tenacity"". They also have a language advantage, since certain Asian numbers are easier organized compared to other languages, and are easier to say. The Asian Math story actually intrigued me because people always stereotype Asians saying that they are always good at math. I never realized how Asian's language's numbers are much more simpler compared to the complex numbers of the languages and Gladwell helped clarify that. My parents who are heavily old fashioned and follow the Asian culture, I finally realize what they have been trying to get through to me all of these years. I could definitely relate to all of this, and now I seem to fully understand why Asians are superior at math and the explanation that patience is a virtue with the reference to the rice patties. After reading ""Outliers"", Gladwell helped clear up a couple misconceptions of success as well as provide some very detailed explanations on how famous people got to where they are today. I liked the many stories and examples that Gladwell used throughout the novel, and I hope that future generations can read about success through Gladwell's point of view.",2011-03-28,
8540,1,"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",2011-03-28,

Malcolm Gladwell explains all the insights of how the people we least expect become successful or unsuccessful. Just become someone is intelligent and has high IQ, does not mean they will always become the most productive. Timing, opportunities, culture, and practical intelligence also play into how successful a person may be turn out to be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not directed towards group. Anyone can read it and everyone should read this novel. I found it to be brilliant and useful in various ways. Overall, Gladwell wrote an excellent message through this novel.",2011-03-28,
8542,1,"Thoughts on a great book!. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In my senior English class, one of the requirements was to complete your best seller, The Outliers. I found the topics discussed to be very interesting to me as a person, and to the way I analyze and think about everyday occurrences. I now can look at the things that go on in my life daily, such as driving to school, and think is there maybe an underlining purpose or reason as to why I do it. Your book has really opened my eyes to the many predictable parts of life I did not previously realize. As part of our course, we're asked to reflect on the question How did I get here"" along with other related questions. I feel your book has given me more of an idea of how I can't always control outcomes, and that it is not the situations you handle that predict the future, but rather the uncontrollable factors you can't see coming. You gave an example of NHL players and their birth dates in the beginning of the book I found especially intriguing. You mentioned how no matter the age or amount of exposure a player had, they were mostly all born in the early part of January. Your explanation of this was because the cutoff date is right after the New Year for most organizations, so these younger kids would get more playing time then people who missed the cut off date. This would allow them to play against kids in most cases that were older than them by year but not by ability. Because of this, amateur hockey leagues would pick up these players and develop them into today's hockey stars. It proves that in most cases, it is the things you can control that define you. You also brought up the Beatles and what impact their playing experience had on their ability to make it big. It was shown that they had been given an opportunity at a local bar to play 7 hour gigs many times throughout the week. It not only gave them the tools necessary to not be gun-shy when their time came, but it gave them those necessary 10,000 hours to perfect their craft. This is a message that particularly hit home with me, an aspiring musician. I realized at that point that the time I put in practicing my instrument and understanding music was not enough. If I wanted to actually be as close to perfecting an instrument or anything for that matter, I needed to put in close to 10, 000 hours practicing. As of right now, one to two hours a day just will not simply cut it, and I need to dedicate myself more in order to become the best I can be. Something's like the 10,000 hour theory are predictable and at some point obtainable. In music you are always trying to perfect your craft, so when you hear of something that is obtainable, you go for it. The last part of your book I wanted to bring to your attention and discuss with you was Chapter 7: the chapter that explained how many airplane accidents are based off of cultural differences. You made me realize that when cause of an accident is explained, it most likely not the case. It is in fact, normally a series of failures in communication, starting with pilot and co pilot communication. If you are to fly, you must set up the necessary lines of communication. One must make it clear that if there is a situation in which lives are at stake, the co pilot can correct the pilot. I think you provided readers with a valuable life lesson here, in basically saying, for any situation to prove positive, communication must be always open. I thoroughly enjoyed your book, and look to read other literature by you in the future!",2011-03-28,
8543,1,"A Fantastic Read. Outliers is by far one of the most interesting and unique books I have read, period. The content really makes you stop and analyze the world around you and how everyday occurrences we take for granted can be explained using raw data and statistics. As much as I would have enjoyed reading the book this book on my own, it was also a part of the curriculum for my Senior English class. In our class, almost everything we are learning about revolved around our essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"". You perpetually answer this question in every chapter of his book using many real world examples of people who have found success in their lives by basically being in the right place at the right time. Outliers is unique in the sense that it is unlike any book I have ever read, presenting the information in a factual fashion while leaving room for the reader's mind to wander about to the infinite possibilities that are possible in this world due to certain variables and opportunities presented to someone. hapter 3, entitled "" The Trouble With Geniuses Part I"" is one of the chapters that deals with one of the variables that a person can control, which is the 10,000 rule, in which a person must complete 10,000 hours of a certain activity to excel in it. Your real world examples really illustrate the effort necessary to be successful, and how it is one of the few things an individual can control. Chapter 4, ""The Trouble With Geniuses Part 2"", was my personal favorite because it really talks about how those who have the capability to succeed don't always do due to their environment or the opportunities that are presented to them. It made me realize that there is a large amount of luck involved with achieving greatness in any field of work. I also found the first chapter of the book interesting because I have a first-hand experience witnessing what the chapter talks about. Chapter 1 deals with elite Canadian hockey teams and the birthdates of the best players. Players who were born closer to January 1st, which is the birthday cut-off for hockey leagues, were always the biggest and most skilled in their respective leagues. I found this interesting because in my experiences playing hockey, I witnessed players who I both played with and against who were one of the best on their teams and happened to be born towards the beginning of the calendar year, you do a good job laying the foundation for the book in this chapter and proves how certain extenuating circumstances can be directly related to achieving your goals and being successful. ll in all, Outliers in its entirety is a fantastic read from start to finish, with every chapter giving a fresh and interesting behind-the-scenes look into what really happens when a person finds success in life. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for a new perspective into the world around us and everyday life. Jimmy Salfiti",2011-03-28,
8544,1,"Perfect for High School English class. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In our Senior English class, the essential question we are analyzing is, ""To what extent does time and place define a person?"" We have been basing topics and ideas to revolve around this question and analyzing how it does define a person. Therefore, we read your novel, Outliers in which you explain how these factors impact one's success or one's failures through descriptive stories about real life people. Most of the examples portray how time and place can provide opportunities that can lead to a successful life, allowing them to become an ""outlier"". But I believed that three chapters stood out from the rest that seemed the most interesting. In the chapter, ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"", the fact that most professionals had practiced at least a total of 10,000 hours on their talent was fascinating. Practicing a total of 10,000 hours seemed to be the common theme in this chapter because all of the skilled people had that or more while the lesser lacked the same amount of practice. I also agree with this logic because it seems that many people may start out with a bit more of an advantage, but the dedication to strive to become better ultimately separates the skilled from the unskilled. I was also curious to know if there have been any exceptions to this rule, such as a professional pianist who has only had 7,000 hours of practice, but performs just as well as someone with 10,000 hours. Another chapter that was interesting was, ""The Trouble with Geniuses Part II"", which included two different geniuses that had opposite lives because of a skill required through one's environment called practical intelligence. You would expect any genius to master that skill, no matter the cause, but it was Oppenheimer who used this skill to manipulate a situation, while Langan could not. Also, I agree with the results of the study about the lives of wealthier families and poorer families and how it impacts their practical intelligence, because the wealthier parents seem to allow their children to be more independent. After reading Oppenheimer's story, I was curious to know what he said that was so persuasive that allowed him to be excused from jail. Lastly, the chapter, ""Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", was another interesting section about how time really presents opportunities. Flom's cases at the time were considered minor until businesses seized to control one another, which made his cases extremely important and current. Time seems to be the gateway that allowed Flom to become successful. I agree with your logic that some disadvantages could be one's opportunities for success, which is portrayed through the life of Joe Flom. Although, I do wonder if there are many others like Flom because his scenario seems rare. Furthermore, I also enjoyed reading the chapter, ""Rice Paddies and Math Test"", since it related to my own life. I've always viewed my math skills as excellent solely because I was Chinese, but now I understand that many factors contribute to this talent, such as the work ethic of my people. But, although I am Chinese, I do not use the Chinese language so the words are not quicker, which still does not allow me to understand why I am more advanced than others at this subject. Overall, I loved the way you described these situations and how they correlate with our essential question. Sincerely, David Dang",2011-03-28,
8545,1,"Must Read!. Mr. Gladwell This semester in high school our class read your book, Outliers. At first, I thought this was another mundane English book that was part of our curriculum, but I was proved wrong. Outliers allowed me to see the world of success in a whole new perspective compared to what I saw before. In senior English, the course is designed around ourselves and our relation to the world. We explore diversity, religion, and even naming. Our central question of the course asks how time and place define an individual, and I think your book answers that question perfectly. The stories you talked about in the novel each have certain circumstances and problems which influence the development of the character in them, and it really shows how our successes and failures is determinant on not only our ability but also on our environment. To me, the most interesting chapter in your book is Rice Paddies and Math Tests, where you looked into how and why people of Asian descent have higher math scores throughout the world. It was really cool to see how cultural tendencies that are often overlooked can be influential in aspects like education, where usually people correlate ability with effort. I also like the chapter The 10,000 Hour Rule, where you showed how people who have become great in their respective fields have a commonality between them: Practice. Often when people think of the greats such as Bill Gates and The Beatles, they think that those individuals and groups have impeccable talent. But the 10,000 Hour Rule not only makes sense, it's a great way to get people motivated. As the saying goes, ""Practice makes perfect"". The idea that successful individuals have been given opportunities and have made the best of them is hope for us all in different situations. The only question I have about this book is in the chapter Marita's Bargain. I understood the idea that opportunities are the key to success, and that for the world to have more ""Outliers"", we need to get more opportunities to more people. My question is, how would you propose to do this? Do you think that the American education system is showing how its students can take advantage of the opportunities in their country? All in all, I really enjoyed reading Outliers. It was not another mundane English book to trudge through, but rather a stimulating, intellectual novel that built upon facts. I think that the lessons I learned in Outliers will stay with me for a long time to come.",2011-03-28,
8546,1,"Chris G.'s Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, hroughout the last semester, my high school English class has been reading and discussing ""Outliers"". For every lesson in this class, we try and tie it to our essential question, which is ""to what extent does time and place define a person?"" In ""Outliers"", this idea of time and place is brought up constantly throughout the book, with you constantly brining up the idea that outliers are the way they are due to the opportunities given to them instead of the commonly believed idea that they are outliers due to natural talent. In several instances in the book, people were given advantages in life based off of the time and/or place in which they were born. This was prevalent in the hockey players getting a large advantage if they are born in the beginning of the year, or even that Bill Gates was born during the right time and in the right place to be a pioneer in the computer industry. I really found both of these chapters interesting, as well as chapter 3 which focused on an IQ threshold. The first chapter, The Matthew Effect, was a very interesting concept to me. It was a great chapter to start off the book with because it gave a preface for everything to follow by explaining that hockey players born in the beginning of the year have a large advantage over those born later on. This concept makes a lot of sense, but it is just something that I have never really thought about. The second chapter, the 10,000 Hour Rule, was to me the most interesting chapter in the book. It went against all conventional knowledge that people were skilled at something based off of talent, and instead brought up the idea that they are skilled because of how much experience they have. The idea that you will master a field once you have performed 10,000 in it is also an interesting concept, although I do not know how true it is. Even though there are a few examples of it taking people 10,000 hours to master a subject, I still do not feel that value holds true in all circumstances. For example, I am sure that a lot of professional golfers have spent 10,000 hours on the game, and yet no one has come close to mastering it. Every golfer makes mistakes, and I feel that it will never be mastered. So while I think that the rule is a good general rule, it still does not hold true in every situation. Chapter 3's concept of an IQ threshold was also extremely interesting. Before reading this chapter, I had always thought that a higher intelligence would generally directly correlate to a higher level of success. However, after reading the chapter, I entirely agree with your viewpoint. Once the threshold is reached, social skills and networking are necessary to succeed. I have noticed that some people are able to make up for a lack of intelligence with their social skill. Even though someone has not reached the threshold, I believe it is still very possible for them to be more successful than someone who has. A lot of the concepts presented in your book hold true in my experiences with golf. The best players are generally those whose parents also play golf. This gives them an advantage they were born with that generally allows them to develop faster and practice more. This means that someone who is born with less skill but has this advantage can surpass someone with more skill but who lacks this advantage.",2011-03-27,

8548,1,"Gladwell's Outliers Connected to the Teachings In a 12th Grade English Class. Through the reading of the novel Outliers I have concluded that this particular book contrasts very well with the lessons being taught in my senior English class. Throughout the entire course we are connecting everything we learn to one essential question. To what extent do time and place define a person? I feel that Gladwell's Outliers is a great example of real life situations that connect perfectly to this question. Gladwell talks a lot about success and why and how a person gains it. This is the base of the essential question I am studying in my class because success is one of the main things that defines a person. Every chapter in this book relates to the essential question in one way or another. In the chapter The Three Lessons of Joe Flom, Gladwell focuses mainly on how disadvantages became opportunities. He tells the story of a family living during the depression and how he gained success. The Janklows story focuses on being in the wrong place at the wrong time and how they took advantage of the situation to find the success they needed. I enjoyed how Gladwell told the story of the Janklows and interpreted in his own way. In the chapter Rice Paddies and Math, Gladwell focuses on how hard work and the right opportunities will give a person success. He mentions the Asian society and the work styles they have. Due to where they lived technology was not available which forced them to focus on their work. He states that they worked harder than any other occupation pore modern era. Living in a place with less technological advantages really helped the workers gain the success they were looking for. In the chapter Marita's Bargain, Gladwell turns his attention over to a young girl who is given a chance. Marita's story connects perfectly with the essential question. She is underprivileged and living in poor community with her mom and because of this she is given the opportunity to attend a special school. Due to Marita's living conditions she was given the opportunity to possibly make it somewhere in her life. If she had been living somewhere else she might not of gotten the chance she did. This one change in her life helped define who she is as a person today and changed her life forever. I particularly liked this chapter because I felt it connected the most to the essential question. Marita was given an opportunity because of where she was living and what was going on in her life at the time. The entire book Outliers reflects the essential question I am studying and each chapter has a point in it that can connect perfectly to it.",2011-03-27,
8549,1,"Outliers Review. Dear Malcolm Gladwell, y name is Becca Purtell and I think that the ideas in your book Outliers, relate to the main question that is essential to my English course; to what extent do time and place define a person? In my class, we have a central question that we focus on throughout the course while reading literature to help us draw connections with what we learn. The chapters regarding "" the Roseto Mystery"", ""the 10,000 Hour Rule"", and ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"" relate specifically to the central question of my course. he Roseto Mystery chapter explains how the Rosetans moved from their homeland and settled in a small city that consisted of people only pertaining to their specific ethnicity. The chapter clarifies that the Rosetans tended to have a longer life rate than other people in the cities surrounding them. These Rosetans were not in shape and they smoked &amp; drank, but they showed signs of excellent health. Even Rosetans in other cities were not as healthy as them. Research later showed that the reason these Rosetans had such a life rate was because of their lifestyle. They were friendly and visited each other often. As many as up to three generations lived in one house and grandparents were received with great esteem. They lived in a carefree environment. In relation to my essential question, the Rosetans are a perfect example of how place defines a person. The atmosphere and lifestyle of this particular Rosetan culture enabled many people to live longer than they normally would had they been living in another city or country. he 10,000 Hour Rule also relates well to how time and place ultimately define a person. In this chapter, you claim that one must have 10,000 hours of practice in their trade in order to be successful and make it big. For example, due to Bill Gates' talent, chance, and opportunity to have free programming time from 3 am- 6 am, he was able to found Microsoft, a computer system used by millions of people daily.  For him, time and place played an extreme role in his success. Had Bill Gates not lived near the University of Washington, he would not have been able to use the computer labs at 3 am in the morning; hence he would not have been able to achieve his 10,000 hours of experience. Also, if Gates had not been able to access the free programming at 3 am, he would not have been able to practice his programming. he Three Lessons of Joe Flom is very similar to my essential question regarding time and place. Specifically, the setting of Joe Flom's life shapes the ways of his actions. Since he was a Jewish man in New York, he was turned away from many of the New York firms, forcing him to create his own white shoe firm. The fact that he was Jewish and living in New York during a time when Jewish people were not hired often in big New York firms shows the extent that time and place played on his opportunities.  Also, being born in the right generation was crucial for success. If you were born during the Great Depression, you had many more opportunities for success because class sizes were smaller, there was less competition for jobs, and it was easier to get into better schools. This example and statement show how large an impact time and place define someone's opportunity for success.",2011-03-27,
8550,1,"Great Story- Outliers is a must read. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers- ""The Story of Success"" presents simple yet complex scenarios throughout the entire story. I read Gladwell's book during my Senior English class and I was very impressed with the way Malcolm writes. The story line all the way through the book is presented in a very creative, innovative and interesting manner. Gladwell discusses topics of what it takes to be successful, and whether or not summer vacation is a good or bad thing. Two characters that are talked about, Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer are talked about for most of the book. What make these two so interesting is their background stories. Gladwell does a great job comparing these two even though their childhoods were 100% different. The way his thoughts and information is presented are clear and neatly presented. Never once did I lose interest in what I was reading and I wanted to continue reading all the way to the end. You can see the love and passion that Gladwell has for his writing and that what made it so appealing to me and my classmates. There were though a couple things that were confusing and hard to understand. His thoughts are clear as I stated before, but they do become a little puzzling. And as a result of this there is another thing that may be of inconvenience. Some of the sections do become very lengthy and can become a tad boring. Even though the scenarios/topics are of a huge variety, some may seem targeted to only a certain group of people. For me in one instance, Gladwell was talking about summer vacation and whether it is a good thing or bad. He describes the students as the ""rich kids"" or the ""poor kids"" and some readers may find that as a little offensive. The final thing that I found confusing was Gladwell would present an idea, discuss it for some time and then move on to another and leave you wondering what happen with that topic. But in all, Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers- The Story of Success"" is exactly what the title says, successful.",2011-03-27,
8551,1,"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success. The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom. The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? n ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",2011-03-27,
8552,1,"""Success"" seen in a new light. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, various stories of individuals who achieved success in several different ways are highlighted. In the ""10,000 hours"" chapter, Gladwell expresses the mantra ""practice equals perfect."" If you work, you will achieve success. I, too, believe in this concept. However, one of Gladwell's implications within the chapter is that if one does not start pursuing a talent or goal at a young age, one will not be successful. He also says if an inadequate amount of hours are put into one's pursuit, achieving success will, too, be.unsuccessful. I personally believe if one works hard, and truly wants to attain success, they will. If they start at 30 or do not put 10,000+ hours into their endeavor, it isn't the end of the world. There is still hope and great probability that they will be successful. Another chapter that sparked my interest was ""The Matthew Effect."" In this chapter, Gladwell uses statistics to express one's age greatly affects their success. He does so by analyzing hockey players. The children, who are the older ones in the cut-off, seem to show a greater amount of skill than those who are younger. Yes, this may be a coincidence, but I personally think this is only due to the fact that they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. Here, the older children are given special opportunities. This then accumulates to bring greater success. ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests"" was another chapter that significantly interested me. Gladwell, in this section, explains because of Asians' language and cultural background, they are better at math and work extremely hard overall. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more commonsensical than Western languages. Therefore, Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than those of the American descent. Another argument behind his theory has to do with the significant amount of labor and strength farming rice entailed for Asians. Gladwell says that the Asian culture is overall more hardworking because of the immense amount of work had to be put in to producing rice paddies, and have consequently been shaped by their ancestors to work hard. I do see validity in Gladwell's points, but I can also easily pose arguments that go against what he says. As a student who has been in honors classes all her life, I have seen the broad spectrum of students who enroll in these higher-level classes. Yes, there are Asians present in the majority of these classes, but there are many Whites and Blacks as well. I firmly believe that all students, regardless of ethnicity, have to put in the same amount of work; The Asian culture and background does not give Asian students a predisposition to the importance of endurance and perseverance. When all is said and done though, Outliers was a very interesting read. Some chapters interested me more than others, but the book as a whole forced me to see the concept of ""success,"" as well as its make-up, in a new light. Growing up in the US, we are always told that ""as long as we work hard, we will be successful."" However, Gladwell presents his case for hard work as being not the only determinant of success.",2011-03-27,
8553,1,"Outliers. In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell relates the success of hockey players, software programmers, the Beatles, geniuses, Jewish-American lawyers, pilots, Asians, and underprivileged students to being in the right place at the right time, receiving special opportunities, and working hard. According to Gladwell, outliers are ""products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is...grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luck"" (285). In my opinion, Gladwell shows that outliers are not all that different from other people at the start of their careers. They are just lucky enough to come across certain opportunities throughout their lives that bring them success. In fact, Gladwell believes that outliers are not really outliers at all. ""The Matthew Effect"" is one of my favorite chapters. Throughout the chapter, Gladwell uses statistical analysis to show that athletic and educational age cut-offs greatly affect one's success. Older children in the cut-offs seem to show more ""talent"" than those who are younger, but that is only because they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. As a result, the older children are given special opportunities, which accumulate and bring success. I also like ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" In this section, Gladwell explains that Asians are better at math because of their language and culture. He presents many valid points. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more logical than Western languages so Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than their American counterparts. Once again, this initial advantage results in an ""accumulative advantage,"" in which Asians like math more, try harder, and perform better. Although I agree with most of his arguments, Gladwell excludes any information that contradicts his points. For example, any sports fan can probably list famous athletes who were born right before the cutoff date. I personally know successful people who are the youngest on their team or in their class. I also know of non-Asian people who are excellent at math. Albert Einstein was European, yet he is remembered as a genius of mathematics and physics. Unfortunately, Gladwell does not include any of these exceptions to his rules in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading Gladwell's book. Although some of the chapters moved slowly, it was a fast read overall. Gladwell's stories encouraged me to look at success from a different perspective. Living in the United States, I have been reminded all of my life about the ""American dream"" and told that as long as I work hard, I will be successful. However, as Gladwell theorizes, hard work is not the only determinant of success.",2011-03-26,

8560,1,"Interesting Theories Of Success. In Outliers, The Story Of Success, Malcolm Gladwell shows research that puts forward the theory that success is a combination of factors. While intelligence plays a large part, so do birth order, cultural assumptions, and above all hard work. Individuals must have the ability to see opportunities and then have the skills to take advantage of them. ne of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players. They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year. Inexplicable coincidence? No, more likely that this phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed. Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams. his plays out over and over again when trends are seen. The dot-com millionaires? Almost all were born from 1952-1955, when the computer was first introduced to the public, and kids in schools could get hours upon hours of programming time. Successful musicians? Most practice hundreds more hours than those who just never quite make it to the top. Both groups are talented, but one group takes advantage of opportunities and hard work to develop that talent. n one study, bright children in California were tested and tracked for over forty years. Although all started in the brightest groups, by adulthood they had fallen into the superstars, the average and those who didn't quite make it. Luck of the draw? That assumption can be challenged when the facts show that those in the bottom group almost overwhelmingly had parents who were uninvolved in their lives and who didn't help their children focus and refine their talents. Parenting styles seem to make a big difference. ladwell has written a thought-provoking book. His thesis can be summed up in this quote: ""...success follows a predictable course. It is not the brightest who succeed. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ...To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all."" This book is recommended for readers that are interested in learning how the world works and how we might improve it.",2010-11-28,
8561,1,"Superb, intelligent, fascinating: everyone should read this book!. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most educated, eye-opening, reader friendly books I have ever read. And that's saying something. Being thirteen years old, many books relating to this topic are quite complex and hard to understand. However, Outliers has understandable comparisons and simpler topics in a way that makes it comprehendible but interesting at the same time. Now don't go thinking this is a simple, seventh grade read. It's not. Outliers is sophisticated and intelligent. n this succulent statistical story of success, Malcolm Gladwell talks about the outliers of humanity: Bill Gates, Joe Flom, Christopher Langan, and so on. He discusses why Asians are good at math, ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"" (title of chapter seven), and what really happens over summer vacation for high poverty and upper class. And most of all, he talks about their stories. According to Outliers, there is no such thing as ""rags to riches."" All those remarkable and extremely successful people got where they were by some chance, and ten thousand hours of practice. Ten thousand hours. That's the magic number. If you get that many hours of doing something, then you will be a master. However, it takes more than drive to get to this ambitious goal: you have to the opportunity to reach it. It just so happened that Bill Gates's school was one of the first to have a computer terminal, and it just so happened that he lived right by the University of Washington which just so happened to also have a computer terminal with free hours from three to six, and so on and so on.  only have one argument with Malcolm Gladwell on his book. He forgot to account for genetics and the exceptional person's drive that makes him want to spend every possible moment programming on a computer. How would Joe Flom have become one of the most successful lawyers in America if he hadn't tried hard at school and worked hard enough to get into Harvard Law. Yes, these people had outstanding chances, but without their drive, they would be nowhere.  loved Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell did his homework. He uses graphs, charts, and illustrations to convey his point. He gives real-life examples of experiments. Malcolm Gladwell is just right. Outliers changed my world.",2010-10-19,
8562,1,"Food for thought--and discussion. ""Outliers"" reminds me of the best that important writers can do-challenge our pre-conceived notions about life's lessons with well researched, clearly written convincing refutations of the status quo. Whether you agree or disagree with Gladwell's conjectures, this is a great book to discuss with friends; it's perfect for a book club choice. Highly recommended.",2010-09-20,
8563,1,"Intriguing. Have you ever been jealous of someone else's success or wanted to be as successful as some wealthy or talented celebrity? According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book, Outliers, chances are if you were born at the right time of the year, and the right time of the century, have luck on your side and are willing to work lots, you, too, can be on the cover of Forbes Magazine. In short, if you thought success was all about being innately amazing, this book will change your thinking. And even better, I recommend this book, with only a few reservations. he first chapter of the book talks about why almost all pro hockey players are born in the first three to four months of the year.  A large part of hockey is being able to push each other around. Therefore being older and most often bigger than others is a huge advantage.  These older and therefore bigger kids then get chosen for the travel team with the best coach and they get the most playtime. And after a few seasons of preferential treatment these kids are superior. nother huge part of success, that is largely unexplainable, is straight up luck. Why did Bill Gates's middle school's mothers' club choose to buy a state of the art computer? What if he had been born just two years earlier and the technology did not exist when he got to middle school? Or what if he had been born two years later so that by the time he was in middle school, the demand for computers was so high that it was tough for kids to get time on the system? He might not have gotten all that time that he easily snatched right up. As you can see much of success is pure luck. But the biggest reason Bill Gates succeeded is because he went on to practice his programming. ust because of when you are born does not trump practice, and the book even agrees. For example, if you have 10,000 hours of practice by the time you are eighteen, you will be a pro at what you are doing. Want some real world examples? Just look at Tiger Woods, Bill Gates or Bill Joy. The amount that Bill Gates and Bill Joy worked from the time they started programming in late middle and early high school is enormous. The stories that Joy tells of all the time he put in programming blows your mind when you realize there was absolutely nothing else going on in this kid's life. This young programmer and his colleagues loved what they did. So they did it lots, and lots and lots! And, look at them now, they're really successful.  would definitely recommend this book particularly to students because of the stress that some undergo from worrying about the future. But I will warn you, it may get a bit tedious at points. Gladwell's writing can go off in tangents. However, I'm glad I read it and was able to add some awesome information to my repertoire.

8565,1,"This book rocked my world!. Mr. Gladwell makes some stunning observations. My childhood Pollyanna ideals that if you just work really hard, wealth would be easy are now replaced with real ideals. It's more than hard work - it's timing, circumstance, luck, and more. The chapter on plane crashes is absolutley fascinating. I didn't need to make it required reading for my staff - they enthusiastically embraced it with a sigh and a ""wow!"" when they finished. The chapter is an extreme example of communication across cultures. As communicators in a diverse community, my team now has a new understanding and approach to cross-culture communication. This book will make great Christmas gifts to my kids in college. I sure wish I had this book when I was in college! I recommend this book wholeheartedly!",2010-08-26,

According to Gladwell, no longer does success stream from high IQ or self-intelligence, but more from a legacy and luck. As Gladwell puts it ""it's being in the right place at the right time"". In a nutshell - opportunity + hard work = success ccording to Outliers, achieving success is solving a formula, but can achieving success be as clear-cut as this? Of course not. ersonally, I couldn't really get into this book. Though it did have some very interesting points I had not thought of, the book runs off on way to many tangents that only lead to illogical conclusions with a deep lack of practical intelligence. s a writer, Gladwell has a comfortable and flowing writing style.

""Intelligence matters only up to a point.Other things-things that have nothing to do with intelligence-must start to matter more.""The ""other things""the author examines are the external factors,the""X""factors, which account for personal success-these include,among many examples, the birth month of youth hockey players,the proximity of a young Bill Gates to one of the first college computer centers,the random acceptance of a child from a poor neighborhood into a charter school.Gladwell is a master storyteller, and his own ""outlier"" story at the book's end is gripping.An excellent book to combine with this is David Shenk: The Genius In All of Us, which examines the internal factors responsible for success.Combined, these two books explain the secrets behind high achievers.It's important to note that Gladwell is a journalist, not a social scientist. He makes sweeping conclusions based on anecdotal evidence and is highly selective in the examples he uses. Shenk's book, The Genius In All of Us, on the other hand, is well-documented;in fact,his bibliography is almost as long as his texts.Both authors agree that success is not genetically determined.",2010-05-14,

8569,1,"What's an outlier, anyway?. I am glad I ordered this bestseller. After reading BLINK, I was hoping that this work of Gladwell's wouldn't be as dry and difficult to read. It definitely wasn't. I learned the meaning of an outlier - never heard the term before - and agreed with some of his theories of family influence and opportunities knocking. However, I disagreed with others, such as the oldest children in a class having the most lead time in growth, hence athletic abilty, agility, intellectual development. As the mother of two sons who played professional baseball, I cannot attest to the latter theory, since it would apply to one son with an early birthday, but not to his brother, who advanced in the professional leagues well beyond his older brother and had a much later birthday.",2010-05-06,
8570,1,"It's All About the Opportunities. I have always wondered how extremely successful people have done it. I figured they were just really good at what they do and they worked really hard. Gladwell explains that, yes, they did put in 10,000 hours of hard work, but they also had many opportunities that led them to their success. Bill Gates had the opportunity to spend hours with a computer doing computer programming while he was in eighth grade. He was therefore way ahead of all his peers in the technology department and was able to create Microsoft. It's not that Bill Gates was ridiculously smarter than everybody, he just had more opportunities than them. Gladwell does a great job of explaining that success is not just how one individual worked hard to get where they are. He explains that it matters what year someone was born and where they came from. Outliers, as in the people that are so much more successful than the average person, are not necessarily the smartest ones; they are the ones that had the most opportunities. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's and I will definitely be reading the others.",2010-04-29,
8571,1,"What Price Success?. All of Gladwell's books have been fascinating reads! This book is making me think about my own growing up years/culture/class background, and the impact on my life decisions. It makes me think about decisions I've made regarding my children, and how my husband and I bring our different life stories to bear on this. Gladwell has a way of presenting social psychology through a very engaging format. The main thesis of this book is that success is an accumulation of advantages, coupled with the ""10,000 hour rule."" The book does get to be repetitive, but is entertaining enough to make it feel worth it. I didn't alway agree with his perspective, however. An example is in presenting the KIPP schools, and the role of the extensive hours devoted to studies as a meaure of the success of the students. What bothered me about this is that it does not take into consideration the cultural context of the students, and whether this success comes at too great a cost. I would have liked to see the ""you can be successful if you put in 10,000 hours"" tempered by also raising the question of whether the ""success"" is really worth it and what such success means in terms of one's identity, value system, or other lost opportunities.",2010-04-21,
8572,1,"Fascinating. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most fascinating books I've read since college.

Gladwell's tales spin a story that convinces the reader of the phenomenon of the ""outlier"" and leaves you with this message: if you've found success in life, it's not just due to hard work or intelligence.

Additionally Gladwell is a writer--a man whose words flow with style, a quality deeply appreciate.

I was a psychology major so it was very relevant to what I had studied as well as everyday life. Outliers examines how those individuals who achieved success were a product of their environments and life circumstances. On the one hand it's disappointing to think that hard work isn't enough but on the other hand I like the idea that sometimes if someone fails to succeed it isn't because they didn't work hard enough or that they weren't qualified, it might just be a product of their circumstances. I love the way Gladwell uses scientific experiments to justify his claims. It gives more validity to the book than if it were just his ideas. ecause of this book I have a more positive outlook on things. I've been inspired to find my strengths in the cards that life has dealt me and to focus on those strengths rather than waste time on ambitions that may never be realized. f only I were born in a recession! and not trying to succeed at a career in one ;)",2010-03-12,

8579,1,"Another Highly Interesting Read from Gladwell, Althought it is the Weakest of the Three Books I have Read by Him (Tipping Point and Blink being the Others). Gladwell is simply an amazing writer. His books make you want more and more. His thesis here about opportunities being given to people by virtue of circumstance has great applicability with respect to early tracking of students, athletes and any other endeavor where kids are grouped early in life and especially within twelve month blocks of time. However, the thesis is clearly incomplete because it fails to explain why different people who are given the same situational opportunities are unequally able to take advantage of them: that is, there must be some role for innate ability and other situational benefits that are not the product of history and time period. (i.e., a highly motivated descendant of Irish farm workers [not European Jewish garment worker]) who struggles to maintain an atmosphere of high dedication to learning and achievement in the home and produces a child who founds a large law firm who was not born in the early 1930s) Gladwell can be forgiven, however, because his ideas do add to the discourse of factors that go into mega-success.

Most would think all they have in common is what meets the eye: their wealth. No, it's the fact that they are all outliers. In the book Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, Gladwell challenges their ""success"" by asking why was it so easy for these individuals? Gladwell uses data and facts that the ""average Joe"" can understand. Gladwell shows that the road to success isn't just determination and talent; it's also opportunities and social class. Gladwell shows that some successful people aren't just outliers; they are given advantages by circumstance, social class, and culture that you and I may not have. ladwell has a smooth writing style that is easily read. If you wanted a fluid, quick, and interesting book, I would recommend Outliers. It was fun to read and made me question if I was given these rare circumstances, who the person I could be if I was given all of the opportunities the ""outliers"" received. Outliers in a motivational and uplifting book about ordinary people who, given extraordinary circumstances, made the best out of it. Any book that has a good message like that gets a ""thumbs up"" from me. Gladwell uses a lot of charts, tables and other eye catching graphic items in his book to keep the reader not only entertained, but also to demonstrate that he is not just making up his data about the outliers. I really enjoyed how different outliers were discussed in same chapter to show their similarities. Gladwell also does a good job researching his topics including quotes from outliers and subject experts on the given subjects and people. He keeps an upbeat tone throughout the book and always proves his point thoroughly. ut with by proving his point so thoroughly, sometimes I was bored with all of the facts. While the book wouldn't be the same without all the facts, sometimes the point was overstated and redundant. Some may like the thoughtful thoroughness of the writing but I believed him and was in awe of the facts in short order. I would have liked to see how an average person could actually become lucky, a true outlier; but this of course would contradict the book. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to see someone who truly ""earned their stripes."" utliers is a book for anyone who has ever wondered why some excel while others just fit into the norm. It is a captivating book for anyone who wants to read about an engaging topic that gets into the heads of the world's elite members. The book is a book of success, and good fortune, for those who receive it. Outliers reminds us all to be all that we can be because we have been given certain circumstances or, as Gladwell states from the Matthew Effect, ""opportunities that lead to further success"" If you like an upbeat informative read the keeps you yearning for more, I would hands down recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.",2010-02-08,

The repetitive style of writing that Malcolm Gadwell chose to use ended up losing its impact within the first three chapters. His outdated examples and confusing thought process turned the somewhat interested youth away. he story starts out with a little spunk and a new way of looking at something. An open mind is necessary because buying into his thoughts is key to enjoying the message. The challenge of keeping an open mind served to be a good lesson for future readings, and necessary to liking his book. The beginning is intriguing and leaves you with the feeling of wanting more. All of his evidence is backed up with solid sources and further validates his point, but this interesting style of writing doesn't last for long. s the story goes on Gladwell continues to say the same facts over and over, and doesn't satisfy the reader's feeling of wanting more. For example in the beginning of the story Gladwell touches on the fact that opportunities and time of birth are essential to success. There is a long and satisfying chapter about this subject in the beginning. Just when you thought a new idea would be introduced you keep getting hit with the same idea. Gladwell mentions opportunities and time of birth in almost every chapter. He not only shows how it helped this person, but goes on to explain it yet again. nlike most stories there was no conclusion to his ideas. Gladwell did not organize his thoughts; furthermore, resulting in a confusing book. By not keeping his readers interested Gladwell failed to communicate the message that he was trying to send.

However, as I read further, it was increasingly evident Gladwell has an obvious left wing agenda which contaminates some of his very interesting findings. It was especially evident when he mentioned a study which showed black graduates of Michigan Law School ,despite having much lower grades in colleges and LSAT scores are as successful as their white fellow graduates. His premise is there is a threshold of talent or IQ which must be met to be at the top of a chosen field or profession. He rightfully states how much time those who meet the this threshold practice or study is as important as natural talent or IQ. He then promotes the idea that a school like Harvard should set a threshold and then choose who is admitted by a lottery. But there are well known problems with this approach. To meet standards of political correctness, there have numerous cases where the threshold was set artificially or ridiculously low to ensure the ""correct"" percentages of each race enters the school or the job in question. In addition, how could anyone guarantee the ""lottery"" is a real lottery. The study he sites uses some criteria which are very subjective.

There are so many factors that go into achieving success and being in the right place at the right time is certainly one of them. Of course, you have to take advantage of those opportunities.

Rather than coming away with the sense that luck would stack the cards for extraordinary success, though we are shown just how that has happened in many cases, we come away with the sense our endeavors do make a difference, a big difference, in our success. What lingers is the 10,000 hour rule which is the effort it takes to become really great at anything, and the improvement which can be made in one's education by studying more hours in the day, more days in the year. This is a very hopeful story about the workings of success, yes full of luck, present in our lives all the time.

I have recommended this book to my teenage children, and both of them have enjoyed the book. he book derives from many resources, and draws on many interesting anedotal evidences. While the anecdotes definitely make the book very easy to read and often very entertaining, they are nonetheless sometimes over-extended to 'prove' a point. Although I was very interested in the innovative rice-paddy hypothesis that Malcolm Gladwell proposes to explain the high success rate of Chinese children in Mathematics, I had a hard time to believe in this theory as the root cause. I say this, despite the fact that I was a good math student and graduated from an engineering school, and am of Chinese descent. Nonetheless, the many anecdotes used often substantiate the main theme of the book very well. However, compared to Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"", this book is more entertaining than authoritative. espite these shortcomings, I still highly recommend the book, because of its motivational value and its highly readable style and content. The theme is clear. As long as we are average or slightly above average in IQ (110 or above), what differentiates between success and failure is lots of hard work and practices, and being there at the right time and right place. By definition, nearly half of all of us possess the intellect to excel. Whether we eventually are successful depend partially on luck, but also much on our motivation and how much we want to succeed. ther than this book, I would recommend interested readers to also read Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"". njoy and succeed!",2009-07-07,

I've always been curious about the archetypal ""overachieving"" type; the person with a 4.0 GPA, supplemented with a vast resume of extracurriculars and seemingly guaranteed placement at some selective, elite institution. They seem to effortlessly master their studies, creating a very bothersome imposition in the back of my mind that made me feel inadequate. For awhile, I felt that there was something innate these certain individuals possessed, hardening my fatalistic perspective about the world and making me question my own self-worth. ladwell essentially put everything into perspective for me. People aren't just born ""with it."" The typical stories describing the ascent to success by prominent individuals oftentimes, if not always, obscure the social, cultural, economic, institutional and fortuitous elements that allow that person to rise in the first place. This book, replete with credible substantiations, investigates the lives of many successful people, like Bill Gates and Joe Flom, and show how particular environmental factors and fortunate circumstances led to the realization of these individuals' potential. The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches."" This book comprehensively examines not just individuals, but systems (like public education), and stereotypes (such as Asians being good at math) to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of what provides the proper foundation for high achievement. hough, let me be clear: this book does *NOT* suggest that sheer hard work is somehow irrelevant, or weakly relevant (i.e. ""it's all luck""), in one's pursuit of success. To the contrary, this book emphatically illustrates how crucial hard work is to the fulfillment of success. The book, however, indicates that hard work goes hand-in-hand with opportunity. Your intellectual potential might have you be a great computer programmer, mathematician, or businessman. Unfortunately, it might very well go to waste without the resources needed to foster the development of such potential. There's no point in having a warehouse of hardy seeds without the fertile soil to plant them in. his book has inspired me to push onward with my studies, to work incredibly hard towards mastery of subject material and to seek opportunity and claim it upon arrival.

For example, he argues that there is no such thing as the ""self-made"" man. His conclusions, though rooted in common sense and sociological studies, are often unconventional. You may be surprised to discover that your upbringing and even your birthday have just as much of an influence on success as your IQ or work ethic. utliers is not a self-help book. It offers very little practical advice on ""how to succeed."" Rather, it takes an impersonal and sociological (though no less entertaining) approach to success.

""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting account of the life paths of several very special people - ""outliers"", as Gladwell calls them. He focuses on the reasons for their success, keying in on the factors that are usually overlooked when we examine their lives. While he does not deny that a lot of people's success comes from their own hard work and their personality, Gladwell adds that his ""outliers"" should be most thankful for two main elements: opportunity and legacy. He splits his book into two parts accordingly. pportunity, Gladwell says, is really all about luck and how you seize your chances. Citing such famous outliers as Bill Gates, The Beatles, and J Robert Oppenheimer, the author shows just how these men were able to seize their opportunities on their way to success. A lot of it was luck, where the men were just at the right place at the right time. But the main idea was that these men worked at everything they did. Gladwell introduces his ""10,000 hour rule"" as the true key to being world-class in your field. he second part of the book focuses on legacy, and how specific groups, based on where their ancestors came from and what they did, are best suited for different jobs. Gladwell writes about the early struggles of Korean pilots, and why Asians are so good at math because of working on rice paddies. Our legacies have a great impact on the way we think and act. ladwell's book is an interesting tale of the circumstances needed for success in the world.

He brought into focus things I've often thought were the case, but couldn't prove: namely success has everything to do with the artificial barriers society puts up, not to foster success, but to limit achievement opportunities to those who already have the resources behind them. For example: A case could be made against high school advisors who fail to advise and help students who want to go to college, not because of their grades or test scores, but because of their race, gender or parent's financial status.  Who should read this book? Those overhauling the ""No Child left Behind"" program and all teachers, administrators and others concerned that the US education system is falling behind. State testing programs really only help those who are not proficient (and may never be, regardless of the resources being heaped upon them!); it does little to help those that have the potential to excel and be leaders.

Throughout the book, the theme of achievement drives the reader to want to learn more about how to obtain it. From this, Gladwell then proves his point of the meaning of an outlier, someone who has been given an opportunity and uses it to their full advantage.  Tips of how to gain success are then given which motivate the reader, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything""(40 Gladwell). Real situations are given with proven research, which leads Gladwell to making inferences on the true meaning of accomplishment, ""Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell). The highest intelligence is not required to be successful; it is all based on opportunity, hard work, and support.

8656,1,"Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers. An outlier is one who has reached achievement in a way that was given as only a chance for them to take. Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers, is a captivating written work by involving many real life situations. Not only does it involve Gladwell's own inferences on the success of life, but with the aid of real scenarios that help prove his point. The initial reaction to the word, outlier is not that of Gladwell's. Throughout the book, the meaning of the word outlier to Gladwell, is expressed as people who are those who have been given opportunities, and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. he book is a guideline and proof of how success is reached. The theme guides Gladwell into motivating subject. He starts with the point that professional athletes are where they are at because of when their birthday falls in the year. The ones with birthdays at the beginning of the year have an advantage with size and therefore more practice times and better teams are given to them from the initiation. Gladwell believes that, ""Success is the result of what sociologists like to call accumulative advantage"" (30 Gladwell). With charts of the professional athletes birthdates, he proves his point. ladwell continues the idea by explaining that success is not just handed to individuals. A computer programmer doesn't just already have the knowledge of how to create life long used software from the day they were born. The practice and hard work, is requisite to acquire the skill. From this Gladwell, comes up with the ten thousand hours rule. After questioning many of today's profitable people, one being Bill Gates, Gladwell finds out that all of those people practiced what had made them who they are today for at least ten thousand hours, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything"" (40 Gladwell). his book wasn't just loaded with interesting facts. With encouraging advice the book, provided examples and research of ways that accomplishments can be reached. By starting out in life with the highest IQ, isn't always the lead way to getting ahead. Gladwell talked about studies done on those who started life with the higher intelligence and ended up nowhere. ladwell almost gives a sense of hope for those who are average in intelligence. That is why I recommend this book; because of Gladwell's reasoning that success comes from opportunity, excess of hard work, some start of intelligence not necessarily the highest, and lastly support. ""Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell).  By reading this, it made me enjoy the book, and words from Gladwell. I agreed with his theories at all times. The matters that he had brought up, I had never thought about before. From this it gave me a new view of success and was encouragement for myself to work for it in my own life. With the sense of what it takes for an accomplishment, it makes the reader want to learn more of how to do it and that they aren't as far away from it as they might have thought. For that reason, is why all readers should read this book, because it puts a true meaning on life and where one can lead their own path into the future.",2009-03-24,

I really liked how Gladwell makes everything into lament's terms no matter how complicated it may be, and then he reviews over what is happening as he makes his stories out of quotes and statistics. verall, great read and an interesting book and I hope more people get a hold of it.",2009-03-17,

8661,1,"Fascinating, A MUST READ!!!!. I've read all three of Malcolm Gladwell's novels. His work is always exciting! This one doesn't disappoint. I am enjoying every minute and definitely recommend to everyone and anyone. My husband and I are reading this one together. As parents of 2 young children, this book has inspired us to have a different thinking approach to the learning process. It reminds us of the importance of even seemingly small tasks. For instance, reading books every night and having the kids ""read the book"" back to us is a great experience for them. Even though they can't read yet, they are participating in the process. I totally agree with his premise regarding education. We should all get actively involved in our children's lives by providing opportunities to learn. With the proper guidance, we can teach them to participate and think independently, instead of taking a back seat in life. I don't care whether my kids are the next Bill Gates or big shot lawyer making a zillion dollars a year. I want them to be happy and have every opportunity to be successful and hopefully, in their own small way, make a difference on this planet.",2009-03-12,

8664,1,"Success: More than Smarts. Malcolm Gladwell's new book, Outliers, has come out at a perfect time when people are looking everywhere to find the key to success. The past few years have brought about many bestsellers telling readers the simple steps to becoming successful. Yet what Gladwell presents in his book is that people's hard work and perseverance isn't only what leads to their success; it's what they have no control over, like culture, heritage, and upbringing, which ultimately provides them with the opportunity to succeed. n his novel, Gladwell provides many current day examples of ""outliers"": Bill Gates and the Beatles, and on a smaller scale, hockey players and a little girl from the Bronx. Gladwell dissects their lives, and thoroughly displays how each person was able to become successful from factors besides innate ability and talent. In a sentence, it is more about rising to the occasion when given the opportunity, more than pure smarts and ability, that makes one successful. t is by no fault that Outliers is highly acclaimed. As a writer, Malcolm Gladwell is a very articulate and concise writer: he is able to piece together his thoughts and ideas in a manner that presents his focus in a clear and effective manner. Also, his style of writing allows him to present many modern day examples, which the reader can relate to, to back his thesis, and then reconnects them all to each other in the end. Once you get going, it is almost hard to put down this book; it becomes so intriguing that you'd rather find out Gladwell's next component to success than do anything else. No downsides of this novel even come to mind. Overall, Outliers is a book that anyone and everyone should read to understand what it takes to become successful. his has yet to be the first wonderful book that Malcolm Gladwell has written. His first two novels, Blink and The Tipping Point, are just as highly acclaimed and for good reason. Similarly to Outliers, each book is thoroughly supported through research, and each concept presented in the novels is clear and simple to understand. Any of Malcolm's Gladwell's books are a great read, and promises to keep the reader intrigued through its findings.",2009-03-03,

8668,1,"""Out"" of this world. Gladwell's ideas are compelling and this is no different- Outliers shows how people aren't really born out of this world- they are given rare opportunities and work at it to make the most of those opportunities. The Beatles played 10000 hours before they made it big; Bill Gates was on the computer for his entire teen years before he made the leap to create MicroSoft; and lawyer Joe From was litigating takeovers for years before he became world-renowned for the niche attorney market. Gladwell has interesting takes on what we should do since that is the case- have staggered schooling to match birthdates; school all year round, etc. It's a good read, but there are questions- what about athletes? Does race play a factor?",2009-02-23,
8669,1,"The Outliers - It's more than creative genius. I found ""Outliers"" to be a highly informative, useful, and entertaining follow-on to ""The Tipping Point,"" another terrific book by Gladwell.  His basic theme is that when judging an extraordinarily successful individual, you have to look beyond his or her own background and achievement to the surrounding ""elements"" such as family, friends, years of practice, and setting. Invariably, the confluence of circumstances and individual effort are behind what may superficially appear to be a typical rags to riches success story.

In this interesting, well researched book Malcolm Gladwell discuss what the real factors to success are. He debunks the myth of the self-made man who succeeds through hard work and determination alone and uncovers the luck that helped these people out along the way.<br /><br />I liked the way the book is presented. Gladwell takes this information, that some people are predestined to suceed because of their circumstances, and interprets it as there are a lot of other people out there who could also be big successes. If Bill Gates achieved so much because of opportunites he had in high school then how many stories like Bill Gates' would we have if all high school students had his opportunities? By not recognizing the hidden factors to success we are failing to realize, as a society, the full potential of many people. <br /><br />Its an interesting idea and definately makes you wonder about your own life. What has happened that you don't even realize to get you where you are today? What hidden talents do you have that were just never given the opportunity to shine? Unfortunately without Gladwells' extraordinary data analysis skills these are hard questions to answer. Still, if this book makes people even a little more aware of unequal advantages it could be helpful in leveling the playing field.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio, read by Gladwell himself. He does a great job and the book has an easy flow that is pleasant to listen to.

8678,1,"One of the greatest books I have ever read!. Malcolm Gladwell has truly outdone himself. I read Freakonomics recently before reading Outliers and while I really enjoyed Freakonomics, I felt Outliers was more interesting and relevant. Gladwell expertly explains how certain people have become successful and what factors affect one's success, while also answering questions like why Asians are good at math. The book includes information from experts and even quotes from the various people discussed in the book, making Outliers all the more credible. Gladwell's writing is fantastic, easy to follow, and makes this book a real page turner. The book has a nice flow to it, each chapter building on the previous one. Gladwell nicely ends Outliers with his own family story about success, which illustrates all of his arguments presented in the book. Freakonomics exposes the ""hidden side of everything,"" but Outliers exposes the ""facts and reasons behind everything."" I recommend it to everyone I know and one of my friends liked it so much she read the entire book in one night. I loved this book and looked forward to reading it everyday.

8688,1,"Great Food For Thought. I listened to the audiobook version of Outliers because I'd heard Gladwell read an excerpt from the book during a radio interview and I really appreciated his interpretation of his own material.<br /><br />This book is great ""food for thought"" and simply asks us to consider more profoundly how external influences do indeed play a role--often a major role--when one reaches a level of extreme success. He does a great job of proposing alternate theories for why certain individuals achieve GREAT success as compared to the old tried and true beliefs such as: ""If anyone works hard enough, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and really make something out of themselves"" or ""If you're really smart and rich, you've got it made in this world"". The book prods one to think carefully about educational systems, parenting, and other social systems in our culture.<br /><br />I didn't expect that Gladwell would provide a science-based thesis or definition of ""success"", nor did I expect a ""how-to"" manual.

8689,1,"Forced. I loved ""Blink"" and ""Tipping Point"", but ""Outliers"" fell short of what I expect from Gladwell. Not only did the book ramble along seemingly without much thought given to organization, but I felt like Gladwell was forcing data to fit his ideas rather than researching with an open mind. Some of the information was interesting and thought-provoking and some of the book was close to boring. I found myself having to re-read passages because I had blanked out as I lost interest. The best part of reading ""Outliers"" is in comparing Gladwell's earlier writings with this effort and realizing one success does not guarantee another.",2009-01-06,
8690,1,"Theory. OUTLIERS is an interesting book but I don't feel it is especially enlightening or in most cases practical. We have no choice who our parents are, where or when we are born, and much of the material in the book is based on these circumstances.<br /><br />Warren Buffett in his book, THE SNOWBALL, speaks of the Ovarian Lottery and it is hard to challenge this. It may be that with the information we are given in OUTLINERS, assuming it is factual, that we might want to make some decisions about when our children enter school. Certainly being in the right place at the right time has always been advantageous in life.<br /><br />Children born to good loving parents with positive parenting skills will always have a definite advantage in life no matter where in the world they are born. It doesn't hurt to have a little luck but in most cases luck is the result of preparation. As Gladwell states: ""Luck is winning the lottery"". Though many parents would like to blame others for their children's misgivings all should feel a responsiblity for our children's successes and failures. <br /><br />Everyone will have many opportunities in life. The key is to be aware of them and take advantage of them as no one knows when the last one will arrive.",2008-12-22,
8691,1,"Makes You Think. Some people will find this book to be very uncomfortable to read, in large part because Gladwell makes a solid case for ""why"" we achieve greatness or failure. The ""why"", as Gladwell argues, is a complex function of our backgrounds, our environments, our genealogy, and our procilivities to grasp opportunities as they present themselves. While super success stories (e.g. Bill Gates) are used as models, there are also general cases that don't involve incredible success - success in sports or mathematics are two that Gladwell addresses.<br /><br />The book was most valuable to me for two reasons: First, it has forced me to look at my life and assess where I've been blind to opportunities that have come my way - in doing so, I see where I can improve. I also see where I've been terribly ungrateful for the great legacy that my parents, grandparents, teachers, etc. have provided for me. I'm still relatively young - there's time for me to increase my impact for good. Second, Gladwell has caused me to think about what type of environment and opportunities I'm facilitating for my children AND for others who I love dearly. If I take greater care of my ""world"" - the sphere in which I can influence - perhaps my impact on the world will be magnified by those who go after me. After all, success is as much a legacy to pass on as it is the result of rugged individualism and good fortune. <br /><br />Great read - I highly recommend it, for what my opinion is worth!",2008-12-22,

8693,1,Loved this book!. This was a great book. I read it twice!!!,2008-12-07,
8694,1,"A Further Exlanation. It's true, the primary premise of Gladwell's Outliers is that success is not about what we are told its about. It¿s also true that this idea isn't anything new. But if you're on the fence about buying this one, you should consider a few other truths about the work. <br /><br />The ""successful"" people that Gladwell is referring to in Outliers are not the garden variety ""he's a successful dentist"" types. An Outlier is not someone who made something of themselves in the sense that they earn above average income, drive high-line cars, and make six or seven figures. Nor is he referring to wealth alone as a measure of success (J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of his Outliers). He is talking about real - out there on the edge alone - success. The Beatles kind of success, Bill Gates kind of success, so take with a grain of salt reviews that bash The book for being unoriginal or for not providing useful information on ""how to"" become successful. <br /><br />Clarification: Reading Outliers wont help you become an outlier anymore than reading Blink will make you a better thin slicer - but his section on scholastic sports and ""gifted"" classes in grade school may make you hold your kid back a year to dramatically change their lives in a positive way.<br /><br />What this book is useful for is its further explanation and revelation of the true cause of something (extreme success in this case) and a pattern that has developed to explain it that has nothing to do with reality. Gladwell's research is as solid as ever; interesting as ever; and I recommend the book as worth the purchase price. I couldn't put it down, I took notes, underlined passages, then read it again; all without a twinge of buyer¿s remorse.",2008-11-29,
8695,1,"Awesome!!!. I have not even finished the book, but I am so captivated that I can hardly put it down. I tell everyone I know what a great book it is because I find it useful on so many levels. It makes me think of both my personal professional growth and my parenting skills, and it gives me ideas for ways to improve upon both of them. <br /><br />I am always impressed by Gladwell's ability to break down what appears to be a simple concept into different equally important layers that I never would have considered. The reasearch is impeccable, and the conclusions make practical, realistic sense. If you are someone who associates and/or works with people of varied socioeconomic backgrounds, the evidence of Gladwell's conclusions are obvious. <br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone.

8697,0,"Interesting Anecdotes, Faulty Reasoning. I tend to like books in the Freakonomics vein, so I enjoyed the anecdotal format and the stories Gladwell relates. However, I found the conclusions he drew from them to be shallow and unconvincing. For instance, he discusses the affirmative action policies at the University of Michigan Law School and notes that the less qualified minority students are comparatively as successful as their ""smarter""* counterparts. He uses this example to support the point that that once you cross a certain IQ threshold then variations in IQ are unimportant, and thus any concerns about these students being at a disadvantage to their ""smarter"" classmates are unfounded. However, he never considers whether the same biases that allowed the less qualified students into UM carry over into the workplace. Firms are as eager to hire minority attorneys as law schools are to admit minority students. To highlight why his reasoning is problematic, consider whether a person analyzing the effects of undergraduate affirmative action policies on their intended beneficiaries (i.e. minority students) would cite statistics regarding graduate school admissions where the same preferences are in play. <br /><br />* Gladwell is using this example to make a point about IQ levels, so I used this word even though I find it inappropriate. I think here Gladwell falls into the very trap he is supposedly warning against by equating accomplishment with IQ. No one takes an IQ test before entering law school. Therefore, the disparity he is referring to between white and black students is in accomplishment (undergraduate grades, LSAT scores, etc.), not IQ.",2008-11-21,
8698,1,"Malcolm Gladwell continues to impress. I waited a long time for this book to come out -- all summer, in fact. I had the date circled on my calendar and felt euphoric when I finally had it in my hands. Gladwell did not disappoint me! Why?<br /><br />First, of course, there's the intriguing subject matter: wouldn't we all like to know the formula for success a la Bill Gates? Second, it's the expert handling of this subject matter. Malcolm Gladwell always manages to take some pretty heady topics -- like cultural communications and their effects on plane crashes -- and through his masterful handling and style, make them not only understandable but compelling. Gladwell takes you by the hand and leads you through places like the rice fields of China, schools of South Africa, and riots of Jamaica, and explains step-by-step the relevance and poignancy of seemingly insigificant facts that all add up to one profound truth. I simply could not put this fascinating book down. <br /><br />I mentioned the content of this book to my high school students, and they were very interested to hear about how communication styles (assertiveness, entitlement, etc.) could affect their success in college and beyond. That's something they might not learn implicitly, but is completely teachable. Today, I will be passing this book onto an 11th grader, in hopes that she'll be able to find something she'll dedicate 10,000 hours to.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I want more.

8700,1,"An interesting look at what creates success. In this wide-ranging third installment of Malcolm Gladwell's exploration of how people and social phenomena work, the New Yorker journalist takes a close look at what constitutes high levels of success. That is, what makes people at the top of their respective fields get there? As we've come to expect from Gladwell's previous books, the answer to the question is a bit complicated.<br /><br />He says that upbringing, culture and even random luck have something to with success, but there is another important quality that anyone can control. Two chapters are dedicated to the ""revelation"" that IQ is only a baseline quality and success has little to nothing to do with having a high IQ or a low IQ. Rather, success is substantially a product of cultivating a high degree of what Robert Sternberg calls ""practical intelligence"" or what most refer to as ""emotional intelligence.""<br /><br />Gladwell uses the example of Nobel laureates coming from unknown schools as often as ivy league schools. At this level of mastery IQ is no longer a factor. Success has little to do with where you were educated and everything to do with your level of practical/emotional intelligence and willingness to put in the 10,000 hours of practice required to reach mastery of your field.<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting read that isn't too heady and goes by pretty quickly, as the interesting anecdotes are what you would expect from Gladwell.<br /><br />Another book on the topic that I strongly recommend because it has been really helpful to me in actually applying what Gladwell teaches in my own life (for my own success!) is The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book.",2008-11-20,
