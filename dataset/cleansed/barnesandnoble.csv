txpenelope,3,Good but not like Talking To Strangers,"Good but not like Talking To Strangers. This was a very interesting audiobook. Gladwell looks at success through a different lens.  He examines success not just by hard work but by timing. Gladwell explains the 10,000 hour rule - it takes 10,000 hours of intense practice to become an expert at something. 

But success is also a product of timing. The majority of professional hockey players are born at the beginning months of the year coinciding with the youth league age cutoff. Wealthiest men of the Industrial Age are born within 10 years. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, & Bill Joi born within months of each other. 

Gladwell also examines how culture plays a part of success too. However, I felt that Chapter 7 on plane crashes which examines cultural reasons for communication breakdowns during flight emergencies didn’t really fit into this book about “success.”

After reading Gladwell’s book Talking to Strangers, this book was a bit of a disappointment. Overall it’s a good book but not at the same caliber as Talking to Strangers.",2021-04-02

Outliers was a great book that made me think about success in a whole new way. I really thought that the cliche story of success had some truth in it, but apparently I was wrong. According to reviews like Rebecca on Goodreads, who said, “My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis,” this theory of Gladwell’s is very true. My only criticism is the lack of female representation by Gladwell. Allie from Goodreads agrees with me, saying, “Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem.” But overall. I thought the book was quite enjoyable and would recommend.",2017-03-21

There were certainly parts of this book that I found quite interesting and that made a lot of logical sense. Although the points are occasionally repetitive and over-drawn, Gladwell makes the point of using examples that force us to rethink the definition of ""success"". It doesn't have to mean innate ability to be smarter or more innovative than others, and can depend on a person's circumstances in life. 

Looking back, however, I realized there were only 3-4 chapters that I found myself truly immersed in his theories. I wasn't very fond of the fact that he spent 46 pages talking about plane crashes when the point was easily established in a third of that amount of pages. On the other hand, I related to and felt that he did a solid job analyzing the success rates of students that wait an extra year to start elementary school versus students that start earlier and are the youngest in their grade. Additionally, I liked his take on the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" because it essentially provided a perspective behind the reward of hard work.

Lastly, for the first half of the book, Mr. Malcolm Gladwell comes off as quite pretentious, almost as if his theories are superior to all others considering the subject matter. Even though the book is well written and makes good points, it wasn't particularly groundbreaking. It had some really good parts, and some parts I didn't enjoy as much.",2017-03-16

samanthajgordon,5,"Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined  ...","Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined  .... Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" has redefined my interpretation of what it means to be human, and what it takes for a person to thrive and be successful.  The book takes the reader through a series of stories and scenarios that prove that natural talent doesn’t necessarily exist.  In fact, the characteristics that define who we are and how we act stem from a huge underground network that includes what time of the year we were born, our heritage, and other things.  For example, the country in which we grew up correlates to our confidence when standing up to authority.  Americans are inherently unafraid of the distance between a powerful figure and a subordinate, while people of nations such as Russia don’t normally speak up against those more powerful than them.

Topics like these are openly explored in ""Outliers"" in a clever blend of storytelling and statistics.  Sometimes I was reading a novel, other times a book on psychology, and even at times, a book that would be right at home in the self-help section.  ""Outliers"" is fast-paced yet descriptive and never caught me lacking focus and attention while reading it, especially considering that nonfiction books easily become very dry and difficult for me to read.  However, ""Outliers"" tackles such a unique idea and approaches it in a way that gives the book immense reread value.  After finishing the book, I’ve been inspired to look further into some of the researchers and studies the book referenced throughout.  I believe that the best books are the ones that keep you thinking even after you’ve finished them, and there is no doubt that ""Outliers"" is extremely thought-provoking.  While some chapters were more interesting and relevant to me than others, otherwise, it’s really difficult for me to find flaws with this book. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to know more about the inner workings of the world and even about themselves.  ""Outliers"" provides unique insight on the natural tendencies of man and why successful people are so, also influencing the reader to evaluate how they, themselves, can thrive.",2016-04-04
,5,"The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of pe ...","The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of pe .... The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of people who are considered successful in our society. From the world’s best hockey players to Steve Jobs, he concludes that success is ultimately the result of impeccable timing, cultural support, and lots of practice. The overall message of the book is that to become one of very few “outliers” in our society, people need much more than just talent. While practice is commonly regarded as the one and only way to perfection, Gladwell argues that there is a reason almost all of Canada’s best hockey players were born in January, February, and March. The random connections like this one fascinated me as I read the book. Outliers is undoubtedly a book that makes readers think. Gladwell doesn’t tell readers why the best hockey players were born at the beginning of the year, but instead, makes them try to figure it out themselves by offering data sets. After offering readers hints to figure out his enigmas, he finally reveals the answer which never failed to be unanticipated and compelling. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book. Readers are not only interested by the intriguing connections made by Gladwell, but also by the amazing, untold stories of some of the most successful humans in history. Gladwell's writing style is thought provoking and forces readers to think about everything differently. Have you ever wondered why some airlines are so much more prone to crashes than others? I certainly didn’t, but the answers to questions like these are surprising and not obvious. Gladwell’s amazing observations and questions enlighten readers and cause them to question the obvious explanations to everything. Overall, I would recommend this book to everybody. The fascinating stories and observations make the book a serious page turner and enthrall readers around the world.",2016-04-03

BLuu2016,4,I am a student attending University of Baltimore.  I was recommend ...,"I am a student attending University of Baltimore.  I was recommend .... I am a student attending University of Baltimore.  I was recommended to read this book in my survey Entrepreneurship course.  This book discusses opportunities people have been given in order to succeed.  Gladwell argues that it is not just innate qualities, talent, or a high IQ that makes someone succeed, but it is cultural heritage, work ethic, support from people, and someone’s attitude that enormously help someone succeed when taking opportunities.  

I like how the introduction of this book and the last chapter and epilogue all tie the book together to make it cohesive.  The introduction of this book was very fascinating to me because it talked about how a group of people living in Roseto, Italy all lived long lives and it wasn’t because of genetics, it was all because of how these people lived and socialized in their culture that made them unique.  I never knew something like this could occur.  I also liked the ending of the last chapter that suggested more people need to become successful so it won’t just be a small amount of people making it to the top. This inspired me because it made me recognize that someone doesn’t have to say they made it despite their circumstances, but actually made it with the support of their cultural upbringing and circumstances and challenges they faced.  One thing I would improve was chapter seven, “The Ethnic Theory of Plane crashes,” by taking out some of the meandering because it was a tad bit of a long and drawn out chapter. 

This book is useful to other Entrepreneur students because it provides a positive outlook and inspiration for those that may think they don’t have what it takes to be an entrepreneur.  Essentially, this book can help someone realize that they don’t have to let their struggles or challenges stop from what they want to achieve.",2016-03-14

The random causes of life can make or break the opportunities you have.

Outliers is an exquisitely gathered and analyzed mass of information with the personal touch that makes it all coherent, and certainly worth reading. Outliers focuses on the cases of individuals whose achievement is exceptional, who somehow possess an innate talent or ability that allows them to reach high levels of success. Gladwell analyzes the individual stories of Oppenheimer, The Beatles, and Bill Gates among other to illustrate his complex, yet innately uncomplicated theory about society.  His writing challenges assumptions about success and it&amp;rsquo;s origins, and proposes several novel ideas in the field of &amp;ldquo;outliers&amp;rdquo; in society.  This book is definitely worth your time, the definition of a &amp;quot;great read&amp;quot;",2014-10-15

I was more or less bored reading the second half which discussed families, and locations that define how hard you are going to work to be successful.  I also did not agree some of the facts discussed in the second half.

,1,Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ,"Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ. Unfortunately Mr. Gladwell did not have adequate knowledge of IQ tests to write with sufficient understanding about the subject.  For example he assumes that IQ scores from various tests are comparable.  He does not seem to be aware that not all IQ tests have the same ceiling.  Some tests have a ceiling of 165, others 180.  So to say a person who scores 165 on one test has a lower IQ than a person who scores 180 on another test may be misleading.  It is just as important to know which test was given as it is to know the test score.  There is also the Standard Error of Measurement to factor in, which varies from test to test.  Some tests give equal emphasis to verbal and non-verbal skills while others heavily weigh one or the other.  Some tests are limited to a pencil and paper format while others have concrete objects to be manipulated, so similar skills are not being evaluated.   All tests have predetermined, correct answers so there is no way to evaluate creative, &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; thinking.  For example, one IQ test may ask the question, &amp;quot;In what way are a child and a banana tree alike?&amp;quot;   The correct answer according to the manual would be that they are both organisms, living beings.  But if the respondent  answers &amp;quot;They both have 55% of the same genes&amp;quot;, the response could not be given credit.  The ability to find creative, new and inventive ways of organizing information as Einstein was able to do can not be evaluated with IQ tests in their present form.  So to say that Einstein only had an IQ of 150 does not mean he did not have exceptionally high intellectual functioning, it may tell us more about the limitations of the test. If a respondent is given an IQ test in his/her second language then it is at their disadvantage.  Cultural differences also come into play, especially in vocabulary and in risk taking skills.  Then there is the problem of psychological factors.  People who are depressed tend to score significantly lower than their peers who are not depressed.  And more fundamentally, there is the problem that intellectual functioning can not be measured in the brain as the activity happens.  We can only imply from a test performance how efficiently, effectively the brain can solve problems.",2013-10-01

I found the cultural insight as to what went on in the cockpit fascinating.  As a pilot, I know that two pilot operations are inherently more safe than a single pilot. I will not be flying any Asian airlines anytime in the future! This book appears to be well researched and thought out, I learned quite a bit having read this.  The book became drawn out at the end. It unnecessarily went over same material discussed earlier in the book.",2013-08-02

KCK_Blogger,5,This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book.  Thank you friend for re,"This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book.  Thank you friend for re. This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book.  Thank you friend for recommending this book.   &amp;quot;Outliers&amp;quot; is  very interesting and proved to be thought provoking.  The book is a result of his research on exceptionally successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others.

 

I was always curious about how these people become so successful at their chosen careers and Mr. Malcolm will give you the explanations that comes with their successes.  The book is not a &amp;quot;how to become an outlier&amp;quot; but it explains how some has achieved such success. 

 

It explains how successful hockey players are  mostly born from January to March.  That kids born earlier in the year are physically more developed and thus get noticed and given more opportunity to play and better coaching.  Bill Gates and other software tycoons were born at the right time.  They were in college when computers are just starting out.  They seized the opportunity for computer time when the computer world was just young.  Michael Jordan might be very tall but it is not just his height that made him such a successful player.  Joe Flom a good Jewish lawyer, who was practicing business takeover law when nobody else was taking those cases.

 

Intellect may be important but as the psychologist Lewis Terman followed high IQ children into adulthood, it shows that intellect and achievement are FAR from perfectly correlated.  That one can have general and practical intelligence but it does not imply the presence of the other in all instances.  High I.Q. kids with involved parents also contributed to their success in adulthood.

 

The outliers possesses the combinations of being born at the right time and place, were given the extraordinary opportunity to put in the 10,000 hour rule to practice their crafts, has vision, talent and were in the right time and place.  They were not just innately programmed to be a success, they put in hard work, lived in a community where their potentials were encourage and &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; was there at the right moment.  

 

In our everyday life scenario, does it mean we should prevent our kids from being the youngest in everything they do?  Should we demand hours and hours of practice in the things they decide to play,  be it in academics, sports, music and others?

 

I have a friend whose kids all have close to 4.0 GPA, all excel at the extracurricular activities they joined.  Is it just because they are genetically intelligent and talented?  Or is it because of the cultural legacy of being a second generation Asian-American?  But then, not all second generation Americans are Bill Gates in the making.  Are all their waking moment spent in studying and practicing?  I don't drive my kids around to lots of stuff like my friend did all these years, does it mean I am giving my kids less opportunity to excel?",2013-06-07

I just wish that the author should have discussed members of our society that have achieved success that are not famous like people he discussed. For example, Sam Walton, the creator of Wal-Mart, was a very successful man.Wal-Mart has affected the lives of many people. Has Wayne Gretzyk affected the lives of millions? Maybe...but not at the extent of Walton. In addition, Gretzyk wished he had the financial fortune of Walton. As a result, I believe this would have a very good book if the author did not just discuss many stream people.",2013-06-05

going to be extremely tedious, but I ended up liking the book more than I thought I would. 
In this book, Gladwell digs into the strange stories of unique opportunities, cultural legacies, and the importance of a birthdate that 
lead to success. It is a fascinating ride that had me gobbling up chapter after chapter and left me wondering about the successes of
my own generation and what is yet to come.",2013-05-12

and tears that apart. Through his convincing research Gladwell states that  culture, circumstance, timing, birth and luck all account for success. 
He gives the reader a more detailed description of each through a chapter, chapters that really stood out to me. He argues repeatedly that being 
successful isn't just by being a &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot;-- it requires much more than that, and because of that he convinces the reader that with opportunity, luck, and 
hard work, it's very possible to be successful.

This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theories about what makes a person successful in what they do. It is suggested that much of success is a product of simple (and not so simple) luck. Circumstances and coincidences play a huge role in what makes someone succeed, especially in cases of extraordinary levels of achievement. Another major factor analyzed is practice. It has been found that anyone committing to 10,000 hours (which takes about 10 years out of a lifetime) of practice or dedicated work/study is most likely to excel in that field. While these facts and notions are daunting, it is also promising to think that with enough dedication and time a person might be able to accomplish almost anything.

The many theories that he presents are thought-provoking, and he explains them in a easy to understand, yet sometimes oversimplified manner. Sad to say, certain pieces of evidence that he provides are highly inaccurate or presumptuous. He also tends to commit to fallacies at times.

One example he gave was that Asians do better in mathematics due to linguistic advantages. However in certain countries mentioned, like Singapore for instance, English is the only language of administration. In essence, it means that mathematics, and practically every other subject except for mother tongue, is taught in English, rendering his argument void.

As a teenager, I find it interesting to view this new perspective that challenges the conventional ways one may come to find success.  This book covers everything: how one&amp;rsquo;s culture, parents, circumstances, demographics, age, intelligence, and innate skills can all fall into place when one is merely given a chance to take the initiative and succeed.

This book allowed me to question those who make it big in life: how they did it, how they started, why they started, and why other people could not be like them even though they had the same environment, lifestyle, and interests.  Gladwell answered all of these questions, and it made me realize that anyone can be successful: they just need to take the initiative they are given.  I also think the concept of what an Outlier really is in context to people around them.

	The book, Outliers, is a very fascinating book written by Malcolm Gladwell.  This book is about success and how some people succeed in certain areas and some just don&amp;rsquo;t.  The success of these individuals goes way beyond individual merit.  The factors of success are opportunities given, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule.  These factors help people who are ordinary people become a billionaire or very successful in their profession.  Gladwell explains how professional hockey players, lawyers, people with high IQ&amp;rsquo;s, Microsoft creators, etc. came to be so famous.  Again, these factors are opportunities, hidden advantages, and the ten thousand hour rule.  Opportunities given include factors such as wealth, the schools people went to, who their parents are, where they live, and also luck.  Hidden advantages are something other people don&amp;rsquo;t see in these outliers just by looking at them.  Such as the month they were born and their IQ score.  And lastly did these certain individuals have enough time to practice their skills, the willingness to practice, or the motivation to work hard in order to reach their goals.  I think everybody should read this book at some point in their life.  It is an extremely book.  It explains how some people succeed from factors other than individual merit.  On the other hand, a lot of people who are very intelligent or skilled don&amp;rsquo;t succeed like they are supposed to, or lack of a better word, like they could have.  Everybody believes that the smartest, most talented, best ideas are the ones who are the successful people in this world.  That isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case.",2012-03-08

The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches.""

,4,Greatly Recommended-Read it for my college class!,"Greatly Recommended-Read it for my college class!. The book Outliers, written by Malcolm Gladwell, flew off the bookstore shelves and made its way into the hands of many Americans.  This is an eye-opening book that captivated and fascinated the minds of many readers.  The author, Malcolm Gladwell, used his years of research and ingenious tone of conversation to shed some light onto concepts about success that people believe every day.   His main focus of the book is to describe how certain circumstances, timing, ethnicity/culture and work ethic make a person a successful outlier.  He challenges every day thoughts of many people in believing how a person can achieve success.  Gladwell basically says, here is the research and it keeps pointing back to the same conclusion.  There are many more factors that contribute to success then meet the eyes.  Gladwell uses many examples and scenarios to support his main arguments about why achieving success is such a complex process.  As a reader, you are almost guaranteed to find a section of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book that will catch your attention.  Few of the variety topics he talks about in Outliers are hockey, schooling, airplanes and computer programmers.  These topics just barely scratch the surface of this revealing book.  In the book, Gladwell has a writing style of telling a story and then evaluating and dissecting the story with a much closer look.  It is really fascinating about how all Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s concepts intertwine and make clear the once blurry image of success.  After reading this book, my overall opinion is that I encourage you to give it a try.  I would recommend this book to a reader who would like to learn the truth behind success or anyone who has a fascination with sucess.  You might never know, the book Outliers could be used as a tool to help you reach your successful goal.",2012-02-22

Outliers points out how the environment of one's family, and/or community invariably influences one's potential for mega success. It provokes me to heighten my awareness and purposefulness to expand opportunity for greater circles as well as for my most immediate circle.

The book stimulated me to consider strategies I might employ to facilitate my continued growth and success as well. It can do the same for you. It certainly offers insights that could lead to crafting a legacy for those you love. If you have a dream and a powerful work ethic, your potential for success is multiplied by the culture that surrounds you.

JawadSYED,5,Great Book: Highly Recommended,"Great Book: Highly Recommended. My father had bought this book a few months ago and he recently recommended it to me. From first glancing at the cover, I was not very interested. I suspected the book would be a dull self-help book filled with tips on how to get rich and successful. To my immense delight, Outliers is far from a how-to manual. Malcolm Gladwell does not attempt to instruct his readers. Rather, he tries his best to explain why the common perception of successful people is severely flawed. People think that successful billionaires like Bill Gates achieved their triumphs single-handedly. Gladwell forces you, the reader, to delve far beyond their own personal efforts and skills; to look at the bigger picture. Gates, for example, was born in the perfect year. He was neither too young nor too old when he got into computer programming for him to be successful. Growing up in a wealthy household, Gates had the necessary resources. Additionally, he got unlimited access to the computers at the University of Washington when he was in college; He had far more programming experience than his peers of similar intelligence. Gladwell pulls out these seemingly insignificant factors but makes you believe that they, not his genius, are the reasons for his success. Among explanations for successful businessmen, Gladwell manages to throw in some really interesting observations. For instance, professional hockey players are predominantly born in January and Asian airline pilots are more likely to crash than American pilots. He emphasizes the influence of upbringing and cultural background when looking at success. The author relates the Chinese tradition of cultivating rice paddies with Chinese superiority in math. Though these claims can sound ridiculous, Gladwell elaborately explains his reasoning until it actually starts to make sense. Gladwell has a writing style that draws the audience in. I would highly recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell to anyone who possesses an open mind; anyone prepared to view success in a whole new light.",2012-01-17

TomShine-APenglish,5,A great non-fiction read,"A great non-fiction read. In statistics, an outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the set of data. In Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book Outliers he uses the term to express anyone or anything whose achievements fall outside normal experience and follow a peculiar and unexpected logic. In terms of the nonfiction literature I have read recently, his book seems to be an outlier. The book is entertaining, captivating, and helpful. 
	I have always been interested in those individuals who make it big, and become wildly successful. I always though to myself that these individuals must have been born for success. In Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s book he investigates just that, and looks at the social, economical, and cultural elements that lead to the realization of and individual&amp;rsquo;s potential. The book looks into strange phenomena&amp;rsquo;s within the success of individuals. One of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players. They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year. This phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed. Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams. This is just one example of the factors Gladwell presents that attribute to success. 
         It may seem that the book writes off pure hard work and determination, but Gladwell also presents the 10,000 hour rule. He gives examples of musical prodigies, the Beatles, and Bill Gates and explains that they only achieved greatness due to the &amp;ldquo;10,000&amp;rdquo; hours of practice they had in their field. 
	This was a very thought provoking read. I would recommend this to anyone interested in psychology or the hidden factors that shape the world we live in. I enjoyed this book greatly.",2012-01-09

FelipeRemolina,5,Awesome book - intriguing and stimulating - a must read,"Awesome book - intriguing and stimulating - a must read. The book Outliers by Maclcolm Gladwell is by far the best book that I have ever read. I absolutely recommend it to everyone, especially anyone with a curiosity or interest of success, psychology, or the influence of cultural backgrounds and atmosphere on an individual. 
It presents and develops ideas that provoke hours of thoughts on the subject of success. It further details, and truly exemplifies ideas that explain why Outliers such as the Beetles, Bill Gates, the Chinese, and others have obtained the great success that that have. 
The book is divided into two parts, Opportunity and Legacy. In Outliers, Gladwell manages to explain through thorough explanation of connections and patterns what leads to brilliant success. He illustrates how countless hours of hard work (10,000 at the minimum to be exact), and opportunity culminate to allow someone to exceed expectation. He disproves the thought that sheer brilliance is what it takes to become an outlier. 
Gladwell explains throughout the book that &amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t rise from nothing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Success is not a random act&amp;rdquo;,  &amp;ldquo;One doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be the smartest, simply smart enough&amp;rdquo;, and most importantly that &amp;ldquo;Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages&amp;rdquo;. 
This book navigates one through the influence of ones culture, atmosphere, gifted programs, opportunities, family, economic status, IQ, and religion on ones self. It explains how such influences lead one to something, and that to another thing, and that to another, and eventually lead one to success. Gladwell explains how these Outliers are a product of their environment and opportunities. 
Gladwell is particularly effective as he supports all his claims with experiments and examples. 
Furthermore, this book is extremely well put together. I truly couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to learn more, and that&amp;rsquo;s what you ultimately get from this book, knowledge. It even aroused a great amount of conversation.",2012-01-08
Maramm13,4,A Must Read!,"A Must Read!. I have always been inquisitive about the lives of ones who make it to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the many other prestigious schools, the professional sport players, and the multi-making billionaires. For years, I stuck with the notion that they were just born this way with some unique, innate ability. I also viewed these individuals as &amp;ldquo;the lucky ones&amp;rdquo;; to me, these people came around every once in a while. Though just as I thought no ordinary person can achieve such a high status, Malcolm Gladwell proves me wrong. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell takes these common ideas and challenges each of them, showing society that the successful people aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;chosen ones&amp;rdquo; after all.
 
Throughout the first couple of pages, Gladwell discusses the lives of professional hockey players. Almost everyone believes that they play at the pro level because they are just naturally good at the sport. However, through research, we learn that about 90 percent of these players are born sometime during the first four months of the year. Coincidence? No, this is rather the result of the cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada being January 1. &amp;ldquo;The benefit of critical extra months of maturity,&amp;rdquo; simply gives these individuals better coaching, much more practice then they would normally receive, and their teammates are ultimately better; this all allows them to eventually become professional players. Although talent is something greatly needed, it is not the major deciding factor in a player&amp;rsquo;s life. 

Next, Gladwell talks about Bill Gates and The Beatles, showing that their road to victory is not what we thought after all. We find out that they both accomplished 10,000 hours of practice at early ages; causing them to be the successful people we know them to be.  Each of them was certainly gifted, but the extraordinary opportunities they faced are what differentiate between them. The Beatles were requested in Hamburg for the most casual reasons. Bill Gates just happened to be in a school known as Lakeside at the very right time. It is through the story of men like these and other people that I learned that we can never make it in this world alone; there are many factors that greatly affect our future. At the end of this part in the novel, Gladwell makes it clear that we should seize any opportunity, no matter how big or small, because that opportunity may be the one key to our triumph. Not only that, but an adversity can at times form into a huge opportunity.

Outliers even goes to argue that it matters where a pilot was born because that determines their success. He also argues the success of Asians at math in terms of how they grow up learning the subject. Gladwell tackles many topics and presents the flaws in society&amp;rsquo;s mindset in a very logical and sophisticated manner. All his ideas are supported with plentiful amount of research. I highly recommend this book to everyone. We are in an era where people are classified as either successful or unsuccessful and the successful ones are seen as the &amp;ldquo;special ones.&amp;rdquo; In reality, though, everyone has a shot at becoming victorious.",2012-01-07

Malcolm Gladwell breaks down the lives of multiple people or companies that were or are currently successful. Gladwell dissects the background and history of these success stories and thoroughly analyzes the ways in which they appear. Gladwell brings up successes such as Bill Gates and The Beatles, creating the idea that although they might be above average in their select field, their remarkable success comes from pure dedication to their passion and a hint of ""demographic luck."" I quite enjoyed this book, it sheds light on a new perspective that claims that successful stories may be outstanding and irregular, but the circumstances these successes arise in are also highly irregular. The stories described in Outliers helps put my life and ideas into a broader spectrum that pertains to everyday people working hard towards their goal who find themselves in exactly the right place at the right time.",2011-10-05

georgialea2,4,A really good read!!,"A really good read!!. ""Outliers"", by Malcom Gladwell. This book goes into a great amount of detail explaining why some people excel at what they do and why others do not. The premise is that someone or group of someones or a something can be so far out of the ordinary that it would be considered an outlier. If you are familiar with statistics, an outlier lies far outside the mean  While most data will be grouped within the 1st 2 standard deviations of the mean, an outlier isn't anywhere close. An outlier can be either negative or positive. In this book, most of the outliers Gladwell speaks of are positive. He uses different situations to illustrate his concept and proposes that most successful people are not successful simply because of natural born talent, but because they worked at it. He suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice for a person to become so good at what they do that they might excel in the field. In addition, these people may have been exposed to ""extraordinary opportunities, hidden advantages, and cultural legacies that allowed them to learn, work hard and make sense of the world in ways that others could not"" (p. 19). Or did not. In addition, when and where a person is born also influences greatness, but it alone cannot account for why some people fly beyond the bounds of the ordinary and others do not.  People may excel for reasons other than natural abilities - read this book to find out why!",2011-04-18

It is not written in the glorified manner of a ""rags to riches"" story, nor in the manner of a ""self-help"" book. It highlights how success is based on a combination of ability, opportunity and most importantly utterly arbitrary advantage. Through analyzing stories of outliers both in terms of successful people and significant situations, Gladwell is able to answer questions about why people are successful, and it has a lot to do with chance.",2011-04-02
MichaelGildin,2,Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.,"Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.. I also found the data employed in this chapter to be misleading. Considering how few people have the IQs you reference, it is essentially impossible to get enough data to make reliable conclusions. Just because factors like emotional intelligence matter should not discount the value of actual or intellectual intelligence. In fact, if IQ is such a crude measurement system (which most people realize), then why use it at all to ""prove"" your theory? The idea that Einstein's level of intelligence was not that important to his success simply disregards reality. Unfortunately, this chapter, with its labored attempts to prove that we all have what it takes - that the smart kids are no better - seems to me like a bit of sophistry that once again makes people feel better about themselves and has undoubtedly resulted in the widespread embrace of this book in our school system that is soft and overly-sensitive when it comes to success and failure.

The ideas explained in ""The Matthew Effect"" did seem to hold some water, however, and I could relate. My school district has an enrichment program that tests students to see if they are eligible in the early years of elementary school. Once in the program, you basically do not leave. Not that we are in high school, it is very clear that many of the students in the program do not belong there. At the time we were tested, age certainly made a difference. In fact, for the first several years of the program, I remember that all of the students in it (myself included) were among the oldest in their respective grades. This was probably the best chapter in the book, as you backed up your claims very well. While reading it, I questioned whether I still belong in the enrichment program many times. It was an interesting point to make, and it did give me a bit of a new perspective.

Despite the aspects of the book I did not like, I do appreciate that you attempt to answer the question of success. Frankly, I feel that it is unanswerable. It certainly is a fascinating topic.

Sincerely,
Michael Gildin",2011-03-30
Michael_G,2,Senior English Letter to the Author,"Senior English Letter to the Author. Mr. Gladwell,
My Senior English class has just recently read your book Outliers. The focus of our class and its curriculum is to pursue an essential question and apply it to our studies to give us greater perspective. The particular question my class must evaluate throughout the semester is ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Your book has been an excellent choice for the class, as it reflects upon the themes of time and place quite often. Throughout the book, you elaborate upon the idea that talent is not necessarily an innate quality in and of itself. Instead, you stress that often luck is a factor, mainly in the form of a person's timing or the culture they come from. Outliers are more often than not the result of elements that are out of their control, as you explain.

One chapter that stood out to me was ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" This chapter highlighted the necessity of hard work in achieving success, but it was interesting and surprising that you assigned a specific number to it. The examples of Bill Gates and the Beatles explained your point. For Bill Gates, in particular, the themes of time and place fit very well. He was born at such a time that computers were just becoming more of a present force when Gates reached maturity. Random events allowed him to have essentially uninterrupted access to high-end technology, which was further made possible by the lack of large-scale computer fluency during this time. Were Gates born at a different time or place, he would not have had access to all of these tools and advantages that allowed him to complete his 10,000 hours (even though the explanations provided did seem a bit revisionist). Practice does make perfect, I guess.

I had a difficult time connecting with the chapter ""Marita's Bargain."" It seemed as though the stress Marita faced was being pushed as a positive. For disadvantaged students such as her, I do agree that the KIPP schools do a great job of making them rise above their socio-economic situations. However, do you feel that this sufficiently addresses the problem? To me, it seems more like a band-aid. I feel that a lot of the point of this chapter was strained in order to get across to us that underprivileged children are still smart. Which is not to say that isn't true - it is just overstated in this chapter. I also find it curious that in the case of children like Marita, time and place suddenly does not matter. How is she able to overcome her disadvantages and inherent ""bad luck"" so easily? You offer a rather politically correct explanation, something that people in our time (especially those higher on the socioeconomic ladder) love to hear in order to feel better about themselves. I am a huge supporter of education and equal opportunity for everyone, but even I thought this chapter felt a little forced.

I also found myself disagreeing with the ideas presented in the chapter on IQ. Your essential argument is that intelligence is not really a factor in success beyond a certain point, and in fact that it is not really a deciding factor at all. The example of Christopher Langan's genius-level IQ but strangely ""unsuccessful"" life is interesting, but it is merely an anecdote that I do not believe can be the basis for the sweeping generalities you make. The chapter seemed guilty of forcibly adapting the theory once the necessary outlier had been found. (Cont. in next review)",2011-03-30

JcoleJC,5,Letter to the Author,"Letter to the Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell,

In our English class we have been studying topics of religion, diversity, and age while constantly asking ourselves the essential question, ""to what extent do time and place define a person?"" Throughout your book, time and place were referenced multiple times as characteristics of an outlier. The most obvious reference being the chapter of 10,000 hours. Each professional whom you interviewed each estimated they had spent 10,000 hours honing there skills, whether it be in programming or singing, before they were considered experts by others. Another reference from your book to our essential question was the chapter on Harlan, Kentucky. A place where culture crafted ones creativity, personality, and even length of life! The members of this community understand hard-work on a different level than other citizens of America at the time. A third, but certainly not final reference from your book to our essential question, is the first chapter on the Matthew Effect. In this chapter both time and place effect each member of high-performance teams. They had been born around January 1st, giving them a slight age advantage. They also were born into an area where hockey was thought of highly. Your book took a seemingly vague question and answered it multiple times; time and place effect a persons entire life from his first breath to his last.

Thank you,

,4,An interesting look at the meaning of success,"An interesting look at the meaning of success. Mr. Gladwell, I am currently a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School, and am in Senior English. In Senior English, as in all English classes, we have a central question that all our units and lessons revolve around that structures what we should be taking away from the course. In Senior English, our question is: to what extent do time and place define a person? Your book, Outliers, is the first book we read in the class, and you can probably guess as to why your book was chosen to fit in with our curriculum. Your book perfectly demonstrated how time and place can affect, and in some cases, completely determine the success of an individual. One of my favorite chapters was the one about the 10,000 hour rule. I liked that you pointed out that talent doesn't come to anyone without putting in a large amount of work in. Growing up I was involved in many activities, but I never stuck with any of them because I saw other kids who were better at them than I was and I assumed talent at a particular skill was something a person is either born with or not. It never occurred to me that maybe those kids invested more time into their skill than I did. It was also pretty amazing to learn that even people like Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and The Beatles had to put in 10,000 hours before they were able to be at the top of their field. Another chapter I enjoyed was the one about the Matthew effect. It was interesting to learn how the date of birth of an athlete can affect his or her chances of doing well in his or her sport and making it to a professional league. I feel bad for the hockey players that could have been good if only they had been given a little extra time to grow and develop, like the players whose birthdays fell right after the cutoff date. The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy is very interesting; that something false can evoke a behavior that makes the falsehood seem true. I can relate to this chapter because the cutoff for kindergarten in my school district is early September, and I was born in late August. I am usually the youngest in my class, and one of the youngest in my grade. Sometimes I was not as quick in school because my brain was not as developed as the kids in my grade who were born in September or October. I also liked the chapter about the Asian rice paddies. There has always been the stigma that Asians are better at math, but I never knew where the stigma came from. This chapter pointed out that Asians' talent for math comes from their culture with rice paddies. I liked this chapter, along with others, that demonstrated that a person's cultural background can influence their success. The idea that who your ancestors are can determine if you achieve a lot or a little is fascinating. Outliers was an interesting book to read, and it made me think about what the true meaning of success was, and by what means people reached success. I enjoyed the book, and I think it added a lot to our English curriculum. Sincerely, Michelle Lineberger",2011-03-29
,5,Letter to Author,"Letter to Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
	I am a high school student and in my English class we are studying and analyzing the  essential question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The purpose of this question is to understand what it takes to be successful in the ""real"" world. Your book could not answer this question better than it already does. Time and place can drastically impact a person's successfulness as portrayed in this book. Three particular chapters that exemplify this are The Matthew Effect, The 10,000 Hour Rule, and Harlan, Kentucky.
	I found the Matthew Effect to be very interesting. The connections shown in this chapter completely shocked me and I made me realize just how true they are. It tells of a Canadian all-star hockey team. The players on the team had a natural advantage over kids their age though, because of the cut off dates. With how they fell, the bigger and older boys naturally had more ability, therefore giving them an unfair advantage over the other boys in their birth year. This chapter gives an example of how time and place gave the hockey players greater opportunities than some of the other ones. I definitely agree with this chapter completely, even though I never even realized it was happening. The question that this chapter left me with was if the same situation happens with school and grades today.
	The next chapter, The 10,000 Rule, was the one that I found to be the most interesting and informative. The idea is that a person cannot perfect a skill until they have had 10,000 hours of practice put into it. I agree with this rule. It seems like an extreme number, but if you think about it; it really does make sense why it would be so high. And how can someone not be perfect at a skill after 10,000 hours? Time needs to be sacrificed and given in order to achieve what the person wants to achieve.  
	The last chapter, Harlan, Kentucky was intriguing. It made me see culture in a different aspect. The idea that place could have that much affect on a person's personality and perspective about everything is interesting. I agree with the idea of the chapter, though, again, I never gave it much consideration before reading this book. It makes me wonder how this idea could have affected my family and point of view.
	A lot of the stories in the book relate to me in some way or another and that is what makes it such a great read. I found connections in all of the chapters that I mentioned and I believe that they all hold much truth. 
Thanks for your time!

JerryL,4,Senior English,"Senior English. (Cont.) Although I found most of your answers to quite reasonable, I found that your explanation regarding the ""Matthew Effect,"" was quite general. I don't believe that being older necessarily makes you better at something. After all, in the context of hockey players, the older kids are only older by a couple of months. However, I did agree with the fact that our society focuses too much on initial success and we naturally write off those who don't experience initial success as failures. As a result, we do tend to make the successful more successful while those who initially fail, continue to fail due to lack of resources and opportunities. This fact applies to students in school. At our school we have enrichment programs that selectively help the kids who initially showed talent in elementary school. However, as we grow older, I see that there are people not in enrichment that are smarter than some kids who are in it. 
	Overall, I found Outliers to be a thought provoking book that addressed situations and questions that we as a society often wonder about. The book is outstanding regarding the fact that it teaches us to analyze with logic and rational. As I have mentioned before, it is the perfect book to address our essential question.

Sincerely,

Jerry_L,4,Senior English,"Senior English. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
I am a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School. For our English class this year, we read Outliers: The Story of Success. Outliers seemed like the perfect book to evaluate our essential question; to what extent do time and place define a person? The purpose of having an essential question is to promote greater levels of thinking, which, in turn allows us to evaluate situations with a new perspective that looks beyond the obvious. The information presented in Outliers was perfect for our English course because it evaluated each situation with a deeper outlook. For instance, instead of coming to the conclusion that Korean pilots are naturally inclined to crash planes, the book evaluated reasons such as Power Indexes, and different cultures' tolerance for ambiguity. It is logical process of evaluating all aspects of a situation before jumping to conclusion that makes Outliers relevant to our course of study.  
	While reading the book, I found some of the presented answers to be illuminating while I found others to be overly general. For instance, Chapter 2 discussed the 10,000-Hour Rule, which I found to be rather interesting because it explained why people like Bill Gates are successful. Many of us often wonder what it takes to be next Bill Gates and I found it surprising that the answer is practice. My dad, like most parents, is always telling me that practice makes perfect. I've always found it hard to believe that practice is all it takes but I have to admit that, after reading Outliers, it does make sense. When I used to play violin, I found that the best violinists were the ones who practiced a lot. They were the ones that took lessons early in their childhood and as a result, they are able to accumulate many practice hours. However, I am glad you pointed out that other factors like opportunity and time play a role in determining success. 
	The chapter that I found most insightful was Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, in which you discussed a theory on why Asians are so good at math. As an Asian, I was really glad that you chose to address this topic because many of my friends subscribe to the misconception that Asians are naturally good at math. I have always wondered; why exactly are Asians good at math but time after time, I have failed to procure a reasonable answer. I was almost convinced that maybe Asians are just naturally good at math when I read your book. I found it rather interesting that there was a correlation between hard work in the rice paddies and one's ability to do math. Reflecting back, it makes perfect sense because those in my school who are the best at math are the ones who don't give up. I was also surprised that you related math and language. I tested your theory that the Chinese language makes it easier to memorize numbers, by asking my dad to repeat numbers in Chinese and it turns out that he could remember them. On the other hand, I could not when I repeated the numbers in English. (Cont. on next review)",2011-03-28

HMONS,4,Outliers Letter to the Editor - Senior English,"Outliers Letter to the Editor - Senior English. Mr. Gladwell, It was a pleasure reading Outliers, which is one of the more interesting books that I have ever read in school. My teacher chose Outliers as a class reading because it ties in really well with the essential question of our senior English course; the essential question is, ""to what extent does time and place define a person."" Before reading this book, I agreed that time and place can affect one's life; however, I never thought that it could have such a drastic effect on one's success. In Chapter 4, when you told the story of Christopher Langan, I was shocked to read that such a brilliant man like Langan can have such a disappointing future. In Outliers, you mentioned that practical intelligence is ""a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills are from our families"" (Gladwell 102). I found it really interesting that the most important factor in one's success is the environment one was raised in and not the level of analytical intelligence or IQ one possesses. It is something that is totally out of one's control, yet it still has such a dramatic effect. This quote really made me reflect on how I was raised as a child. I questioned my parents' parenting techniques and debated whether or not I have acquired this practical intelligence. As I kept on reading, the KIPP program that you talked about really caught my interest. Giving children who wouldn't otherwise get the chance to learn that much and get a better shot at college and a suitable job is awesome. Everyone deserves an opportunity like that. In a way, I had my ""KIPP"" program because I grew up in Philadelphia but my parents were able to send me to private school and not a filthy public school. The chapter that talked about plane pilots also caught my attention. I agree with you that your background may affect how you perform in serious situations. Americans know not to be passive especially when something is wrong, but someone from Spain or Colombia may be passive to the pilot because they are in command. This idea shows place can affect one's work and even life. Through the years though I think many are beginning to overcome this barrier. Overall, I believe you answered the essential question really well and all your ideas were very well explained and supported with great evidence. Therefore, I do not have any misunderstandings about the novel; however, I did at times think the novel got a bit repetitive. I got the concept quickly and wanted more but you gave me the same information just worded differently. The book really gives you a new perspective on how every little thing can control one's success. It is really interesting and once again it was a pleasure reading Outliers.

,4,VERY GOOD!,"VERY GOOD!. Dear  Malcom Gladwell, 
	Your novel is a very though provoking journey through what it means to be successful. In my 12th grade senior English class we have a question that is suppose to help guide us throughout the course, that question is how does time and place define who a person is? It is, of course, obvious to see here how your novel fits in with this theme. Overall three sections resonated with me the most, Maria's Chapter, The 10,000 hour chapter and the Section about Rosetta.
	The chapter with Maria resonated with me very deeply because I just as Maria come from a disadvantaged home and I believe I have been through a part of what she has been through. My community is not anywhere near as ""bad"" as Maria's but my neighborhood is right up there with drug use, violence and illiteracy. I know only one neighbor of mine who has attended a University. I see everyday what can happen if one begins to lose focus of how to become successful. I do not have to work nearly as hard as Maria to become successful because my community school is more then adequate but I can defiantly see where she is coming from.
	The chapter about Rosetta really opened my eyes to how truly important time and place is to a person. In this chapter it becomes obvious that time and place are affecting these peoples health, in a positive way. It is impossible for a person in the 21st century to truly believe that a person can stay healthy simply because they are surrounded by people who care about them yet this is what this section proves. This section really opened my eyes to the influences that affect me everyday that I had no idea affected me everyday.
	The 10,000 hour chapter really drove home the importance of hard work and and determination in success. I had always thought that success came mostly from God given gifts and only slightly from hard work. I thought people like Bill Gates or The Beatles were products of luck, they could just roll out of bed and be better then anybody in the world at what they do. After reading this chapter, of course, I realized my assumptions were incorrect. Theses men were better then everyone else because they had worked longer and harder then everyone else plus they did have a little talent. Overall the book as a whole taught me that life will give you a chance to succeed you just need to be prepared when the moment presents itself and the only way to be prepared it through hard work.

E_Black,4,Highly Recommended - a definite read!,"Highly Recommended - a definite read!. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
	I recently read your book Outliers for an assignment for my senior English class and found it very applicable to my class's essential question. The essential question varies depending on what grade the students are in and basically serves as the central theme for the entire course. This year, my class's essential question is, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" I have to admit that I did not really believe that our essential question had very much depth to it this year; I assumed that the answer was plain and simple. However, upon reading your book Outliers, I came to realize exactly how much time and place can affect a person. 
	From my understanding, the point that you set out to make in this book was that success is not inherent and that any one person's success can be traced back to a variety of factors. In order to prove this point, you take the reader through a variety of stories such as those of Mort Janklow, Chris Langan, and even Asian math students. In all of these stories, the importance of time and place stood out to me. For Mort Janklow, time was imperative to his success because it allowed him to find a job. In the cases of Chris Langan and Asian math students, it seemed that location was more important to their success than time was. While family environment influenced Chris, and cultural environment influenced Asian math students, it is obvious that their locations were determining factors in their successfulness.

,5,David G's Review - FANTASTIC NOVEL :) (review is cutoff because of the stupid character limit),"David G's Review - FANTASTIC NOVEL :) (review is cutoff because of the stupid character limit). Dear Mr. Gladwell,
As part of the senior English curriculum in my high school, I was required to read your book Outliers: The Story of Success. I was particularly intrigued when I found out about our assignment because earlier in the year, I had read your novel The Tipping Point in my psychology class. Your stimulating, interactive, and interesting writing style caught my attention with The Tipping Point, so I knew I would enjoy Outliers before I even read it. Part of the reason that we read your book was because it tied in perfectly with our essential question, """"To what extent do time and place define a person?"" After finishing the novel, it was evident that time and place play such a significant role in defining a person. From the chapter ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes, which I thought was one of the strongest in your book, you explored the reason behind the mysterious statistic in the late 90s, in which Korean Airlines had too many crashes. I never really thought about the reasoning behind a plane crash; I assumed it was due to plane malfunction, but your research suggests it is typically due to human malfunction instead. The Korean Airlines planes were of fine quality - the Korean culture was the problem. It was stressed in Korean culture not to challenge or question a higher authority, so when a co-pilot saw a severe problem, it was difficult for him or her to relay the message to the pilot, thus resulting in a crash. For the passengers on the planes that crashed, their tragic endings were a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can relate this chapter to the helicopter/plane midair collision over the Hudson River in August of 2009, in which several of our family friends were killed. Their deaths, like those of the Korean Airlines passengers in the late 90s, were a result of human error, in which the air traffic controller was on the phone joking about a dead cat. The effects that all of the crashes had on both the victims and their families are immeasurable and are still being felt today. Another one of my favorite chapters was ""The Matthew Effect."" It was fascinating to know that someone's birth date can have such a large impact on his or her future. I only had thought of birthdays as a fun yearly ""event"", but now I realize that they are the cause for many advantages and disadvantages. For example, most sports have a cutoff date; in soccer, that cutoff date is September 1. Some soccer players will naturally be more mature than their counterparts will because they have the birthday advantage, and this benefit will stay with them throughout their soccer career. This may seem unfair, but it reasserts what seems to be a theme of Outliers: ""Timing can be critical to an outlier's success."" My birthday is on September 1, which is typically the academic cutoff date as well. I hope that I can take advantage of ""The Matthew Effect"", and become an outlier academically in the future. The chapter The 10,000-Hour Rule, was the most appealing and innovative chapters in the entire book. 10,000 hours of work in a particular field are needed for a chance at mastery and expertise. I liked how the Beatles were one of the main examples in this chapter, because I grew up listening to them, and they are my favorite band today. I never realized that many musicians have had their songwriting and musical abilities; they just failed to capitalize on their talents, which is what sets the Beatles apart. In every subject, t",2011-03-28
,4,Definitely food for thought,"Definitely food for thought. In my English class we are exploring the question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" It's an interesting question, and Gladwell's book, Outliers answers it well. The book offers incredible insight on success and why people, not just outliers, are the way they are. The theme ""success is the result of a person's upbringing and opportunities"" is laced throughout the book. A person may have an IQ of 160, but this does not guarantee success. Yes, Bill Gates had incredible natural abilities, but it was because the school he attended had a high-tech computer room that he achieved success. Gladwell's own mother owes her success to being in the right place at the right time-she obtained a scholarship in Jamaica, and had she been born 3 or 4 years earlier that opportunity would not have existed. Time and place do not just influence a person, they define him.
	One chapter of Outliers I found particularly interesting was Rice Paddies and Math Tests. Being of Asian descent, many people have stereotyped me, commenting that I must be good at math or really smart. What's interesting about Gladwell is that he does not try to deny the claim or apologize for it-he justifies it. Many Asians actually are good at math, but it is not because they have more intelligence; it has to do with being raised in a culture where patience and perseverance determine whether a family will have food to eat. I do agree that Asians, as well as any other ethnic group, have different cultures and perceptions of success. Gladwell's book is one huge generalization, and it has to be. But I find it interesting that I am of Asian and European descent, and my father's family, who is white, has much higher standards than my mother's. 
	Gladwell claims that a person will become an expert at something, anything, after devoting 10000 hours to the cause. It makes me think, Will someone who spends 10,000 hours playing soccer but does not put in maximum effort be more successful than a player who dedicates 5000 hours of blood, sweat and tears to becoming great? Can someone become an expert before the 10000 hour mark? I agree that time is important to become good at anything. My band teacher always says, ""Practice does not make perfect; practice makes permanent"". So will a clarinet player who plays poorly for 10,000 hours become an expert awful clarinet player? 
	Gladwell brought up an interesting point in the chapter The Trouble with GeniusesPt. 2. Chris Langan is a genius but never lives to his full potential. He drops out of college and ends up leading a happy yet conventional life. Robert Oppenheimer, on the other hand is not as smart as Langan, yet his perseverance and social skills make him one of the most successful and revolutionary men in the world. It makes me think, Are people wasting their abilities? Some of my peers are extremely intelligent, but do not have a spectacular work ethic. Given perseverance, they could all do great things, but many do not want to. Should they be pushed and forced to succeed? Is it more important to do whatever makes you happy? Outliers accredits many third parties with determining other people's successes, but to what extent does a person himself define his success?
	Outliers was definitely food for thought. I t changed my perceptions of the world and success. I recommend this book to anyone who questions, Why? constantly and  although the information may not be ground-breaking and extreme, it is thought-provoking.",2011-03-28
,4,Recommended,"Recommended. Mr. Gladwell, Your book Outliers: The Story of Success was a very good read and it provided me with a new perspective on a topic that is widely referenced. Everyone has heard about the stories where someone goes from rags to riches, but you completely changed the way people think about success stories. Many people believe that it takes only pure ambition and talent to be successful, but you realized that there is way more to it than that. In ""The Trouble with Geniuses, Part II"", you showed that having a higher intelligence than someone else does not increase your chances of being successful. Being in school it is hard to understand how being naturally intelligent does not help because all of the awards and accolades are given to the smartest and strongest. However, the example of Langan and Oppenheimer showed me how some outliers in these award ceremonies came to be successful because they have charisma that others do not possess. Many people overlook these seemingly obvious occurrences, but your ability to convey this method has forever changed my opinion about success. In the class that we read this book in, we have an essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The goal of this essential question is to help us make connections to the things that we do in class and I can honestly say that Outliers provides the best answer to this question. Throughout every chapter you showed a new and different way to explain how success is a result of where someone is at, with two of the best examples found in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""The 10,000-Hour Rule."" The importance of birthdays as they pertain to sports had never once crossed my mind, but knowledge that I gained from reading your explanation in ""The Matthew Effect"" shows how much they affect success. The fact that some players will be naturally more mature based on cut off dates for specific sports seems unfair, but just proves the point that sometimes success comes from a little luck and opportunity. This chapter caught my attention because growing up I played a lot of sports and now I wonder to what extent did my birthday play in determining how successful I was. In ""The 10,000-Hour Rule"" you discussed two things that I love those being computer programming and the Beatles. This chapter contained the same theme of being born at the right time by discussing how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were in the perfect age range for when society began to become more technological, but it also showed how where someone is located affects success. Given that Bill Joy and Bill Gates were located near some of the few advanced computer terminals of the time and the Beatles were given long stints in a club in Germany, it is no surprise that they were able to succeed because along with their natural talent they were given opportunities to practice in places that allowed them to perfect their craft. Overall I feel like this book was one of the most interesting and thought provoking books that I have ever read. The amount of research that you had to put into this book is incredible given some of the hidden messages that you have found in a variety of things like why a group of people are lawyers at the same time. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that you put into this book because it really did change the way that I look at things. Sincerely, Ryan Crim",2011-03-28
,3,Dear Malcome Gladwell,"Dear Malcome Gladwell. Dear Malcome Gladwell, 

I am currently a senior at Hatboro Horsham High School, and for English class we were assigned to read your book, it was actually our first assignment. See this course is structured around one essential question: In what ways do place and time impact a person? So the theme of your book fit in quite well. Our class discusses a bit more then just what impacts success, but the examples in the book were intriguing.
Personally my favorite chapter was chapter nine, Maritas Bargain.  This story really inspired me. I think it's safe to say that everyone in the world has the desire to be successful at something; it could be big or small. But not everyone is willing to work hard in order to achieve success. The level of commitment and hard work this little girl puts in on a day to day basis is magnificent. It made me reevaluate how much effort I put into my daily activities, and made me want to work harder. 
Chapter two was another one of my favorites. Before I even read the book I'd heard about the 10,000 hour rule and the idea made a lot of sense to me. I believe that practice really does make perfect. I don't think anyone can get truly good at something without putting in hours of hard work. Sometimes when I look back I wish that I had spent a little more time practicing things, like soccer or drawling. Who knows how good I might be right now if I had spent 10,000 hours practicing. But then again maybe I'm accumulating hours for something that is not quite as ordinary, and I don't even realize. 
Lastly there was chapter three, the trouble with geniuses. This wasn't one of my favorite chapters, but I do think many of the points you made were fascinating. When I think of the stereotypical vision in my head for someone who is successful I automatically think of someone who is incredibly smart.  But being smart isn't everything, and I agree with the fact that there are different kinds of smart. I believe creativity is also important to becoming successful. And for that reason I am thankful that I have a creative side. Even though I'm only in high school I have seen this in action. A lot of the things we do in school require a basic knowledge, but what really makes one students work stand out from another's is their creativity. And frankly sometimes the smartest person in the group isn't the one who ends up doing well. 
I hope one day I will be an outlier; that my success will make me standout from the crowd. And when I look back and remember reading your book I can apply some of the points you made to my own success. So thank you for writing such a fascinating book and if you read this thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to my opinions, and I hope to read some of your other books in my future because I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",2011-03-28
seansmith48347394,3,Mediocre,"Mediocre. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was a very interesting read. I did not know what to expect when I first picked it up.  I saw that that it said it was the ""story of success"" and was very intrigued in how Gladwell would approach this topic.  The first chapter really made my head spin and convinced me that Gladwell knew what he was talking about.  It truly made me retrace my steps growing up and thinking about how I was raised and how I could have been raised differently (not that I would want to be at all).  Gladwell harks on the idea that when you were born is most important to your success but there were flaws right away in that this was not consistent with things outside of sports or in America. I do not believe that his philosophy on who were the faces of the Industrial Revolution of America was valid at all.  Throughout the book Gladwell seems to continually look past the hard work of many and instead replace it with fate and environment which is not fair to those who worked hard for what they have.  Gladwell also dismisses those who are successful in their lives that have not gone through the ""10,000 Hour Rule"".  In that chapter Gladwell describes only people who have experienced financial success therefore it is very opinionated to what success is in Gladwell's mind.  An example of success that is not financial is Mother Theresa who helped thousands throughout her life and devoted her life to the success of others.  She may have worked at what she did for 10,000 hours but experienced an entirely different type of success.  Altogether, there are far too many loopholes in Gladwell's work and he is too quick to dismiss success of people who do not fit into his pigeonhole.  I would give this book three stars out of five because although it is biased, Gladwell still makes points about stories that are true and interesting to think about but most, such as Bill Gates, are one in a million and a special case.",2011-03-28

Q-money,4,Highly Recommended (letter to author),"Highly Recommended (letter to author). ""Outliers"" has directly related to my essential question for my senior English course. In my class our essential question is ""To what extent do time and place define a person"". The purpose of our essential question is for us to take a close look on the things around us and realize the importance of time and place. In your book this question is answered in almost every chapter. In the epilogue you tell us about the story of your mother and how she became successful. The events in her life directly related to our question because without the men and women who influenced the scholarships for Jamaican children in that time period you mother might have not been able to attend college. The epilogue for me was one of the best chapters because of the way the story was told and how well the chapter was structured to explain every facture that influenced and defined how your mother came to be successful. I also believe that chapter 6 on Harlan, Kentucky was a very intriguing chapter. The information in the chapter made me look at cultures within the United States differently, in a more understanding way. Also it made me realize that many of my southern relatives had the culture of honor. Also I found the 10,000 hours chapter a fascinating chapter. I liked how you showed many different successful people in totally different occupations, and how those people were living examples of the 10,000 hour rule. One of my favorite parts in that chapter was when you went into detail about the Beatles success story. I enjoyed this because the music industry now days it doesn't required a lot of practice to get acknowledged, but to do what the Beatles did takes an overwhelming amount of talent and I personally wish that many of the other artist out there would learn from the Beatles story and see that hard work and practice pays of rather than using technology to improve your music. Overall Mr. Gladwell I just would like to say that this book is amazing book and that it is one of my favorites. Each page of the book kept me attentive and made me want to continue reading to absorb more and more information about the people around us. Thank you very much for writing this book Mr. Gladwell.",2011-03-28
ChelseaConnelly,2,"Interesting, but discouraging","Interesting, but discouraging. The ideas and facts presented by Gladwell in Outliers are interesting and intensely thought provoking. However, there is a tendency to feel mildly disheartened by the theme of the necessity of opportunities and the large rejection of the idea of ""The American dream."" This happens largely in the first part of the book: ""Opportunity"". The first chapter discusses the accumulation of opportunities as a result of each other starting with something as simple as birthdate. The second half discusses the effect of a legacy set before us that is unchangeable and again could decide our future despite our having no control over it. Gladwell's method of mixing story telling with analysis and facts is impressive and keeps the book interesting, but the occasion undertone of condescension can be distracting. Having read his other book The Tipping Point and enjoying it greatly I was a little disappointed by Outliers, but nonetheless found Gladwell's ideas interesting despite feeling slightly depressed by it.",2011-03-28
John_Sap,5,Letter to the Author,"Letter to the Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
After reading your terrific book ""Outliers"" I wanted to talk about some of the topics discussed in the book.  Overall, the book had some very strong connections showing how time and place affect a person's success. (This therefore makes them outliers)  How time and place affect a person is my English IV class' essential question.  The essential question's purpose is to offer connections between many different texts and show how they can all relate to one another.  Many topics you have made in your book, such as Jewish lawyers, geniuses and plane crashes all relate back to our essential question.
	The Three Lessons of Joe Flom was a very informative chapter.  I found it to be a good example of karma because the Jews were given negligible law cases in the 1950's, but when those cases turned out to be valuable, the Jews were experts at them.  Time is a defining element of success throughout your book.  For example, I agree with your insight about Mort Janklow and how he was given the opportunity to succeed because of when he was born. (In comparison with his Father)  A question comes to mind after reading this chapter.  Are there any advantages to being born in 1992?  This is when I was born and I wonder if there are any built in advantages here.  
	The Trouble with Geniuses Part II is equally an interesting chapter.  I have always wondered how much IQ has to do with how smart a person really is.  You have cleared up the question and I have learned more about IQ then I have ever known before.  I agree with your comparison of Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer.  Langan lacks social skills and practical sense, while still being a genius.  Oppenheimer had the social skills and was a genius, which allowed him to be innovative and extremely successful in his career.  I question why Chris Langan was not as successful.  Many people have weak social skills and a much lower IQ and are still successful.  With his IQ, I would imagine he could easily overcome his inadequacies.  
	The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes was probably the most interesting chapter I read in your book.  It was stunning to see that there is actually a difference between cultures that could actually lead up to something catastrophic, such as a plane crash.  After reading about index power ratings and other information, I totally understand how differences in place could affect how one interprets their language.  Do you think there is any where else we could apply this index rating?  If so I would love to hear about it because I think it could really help understand the differences that time and place have on society.
	This book has helped me think about why I am who I am.  There is so much more to think about that you have helped me to unlock.  Maybe I could be better at math if I was Asian.  Maybe I have a culture of honor engraved in me and I just don't know it.  Many of your topics relate to my life and I question really why things happen.  I now know what it means to be an outlier and how the outliers truely got to where they are.

Sincerely,

JunhaC,4,Exciting and entertaining!,"Exciting and entertaining!. In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, Mr. Gladwell explains various different situations and stories of success that have happened in the past millenium. This book reminded me of the many success stories that happen in people's lives, and provided some background about how these people became successful. Throughout the novel, Gladwell stresses one of his major points which was ""The Matthew effect"" which explained being born in the right time and place. He talks about Canadian hockey players that have a birthday between January- March usually end up being the most successful out of the players that are born in that year. I don't think that being born in a specific month then it has being born in another month. A person born in January and a person born in September can both be equally successful even if a person was born earlier. While some good players are born in these months, he does not give a clear explanation on the certain variables that causes the early-born athletes to perform better. Another one of his points that Gladwell explains in this novel was the ""10,000 hour rule"". I have always heard of the phrase ""practice makes perfect"", and was curious as to how Gladwell would have explained it. He states that in order to be a professional, you must spend at least 10,000 hours practicing and polishing your art. He gives many famous examples of professionals who have followed this rule and become professionals. I just found it intriguing that such successful people such as Bill Gates and The Beatles followed this rule to be successful. I was always curious to see how Bill Gates became one of the most successful CEOs in the world and Gladwell explained about the dedication and work ethic that he had in order to succeed. One example is the famous rock band The Beatles. The Beatles's story about how they constantly practiced and played their gigs for many hours a day, and thrived as musical prodigies for playing for about 10,000 hours. I was wondering if the way you deal with practice might have an effect on the 10,000 rule and becoming successful? After the chapter about the 10,000 rule, Gladwell elaborated on the story about Asians being good at math and their cultivating rice patties. He talks about how the Asians had ancestors who worked extremely long hours to absorb ""perseverance"" and ""tenacity"". They also have a language advantage, since certain Asian numbers are easier organized compared to other languages, and are easier to say. The Asian Math story actually intrigued me because people always stereotype Asians saying that they are always good at math. I never realized how Asian's language's numbers are much more simpler compared to the complex numbers of the languages and Gladwell helped clarify that. My parents who are heavily old fashioned and follow the Asian culture, I finally realize what they have been trying to get through to me all of these years. I could definitely relate to all of this, and now I seem to fully understand why Asians are superior at math and the explanation that patience is a virtue with the reference to the rice patties. After reading ""Outliers"", Gladwell helped clear up a couple misconceptions of success as well as provide some very detailed explanations on how famous people got to where they are today. I liked the many stories and examples that Gladwell used throughout the novel, and I hope that future generations can read about success through Gladwell's point of view.",2011-03-28
estee_c,4,4/5,"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",2011-03-28
,4,Success Story,"Success Story. This book was a real eye opener. It shows what other people may never think of. Malcolm Gladwell explains all the insights of how the people we least expect become successful or unsuccessful. Just become someone is intelligent and has high IQ, does not mean they will always become the most productive. Timing, opportunities, culture, and practical intelligence also play into how successful a person may be turn out to be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not directed towards group. Anyone can read it and everyone should read this novel. I found it to be brilliant and useful in various ways. Overall, Gladwell wrote an excellent message through this novel.",2011-03-28
,5,Thoughts on a great book!,"Thoughts on a great book!. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In my senior English class, one of the requirements was to complete your best seller, The Outliers. I found the topics discussed to be very interesting to me as a person, and to the way I analyze and think about everyday occurrences. I now can look at the things that go on in my life daily, such as driving to school, and think is there maybe an underlining purpose or reason as to why I do it. Your book has really opened my eyes to the many predictable parts of life I did not previously realize. As part of our course, we're asked to reflect on the question How did I get here"" along with other related questions. I feel your book has given me more of an idea of how I can't always control outcomes, and that it is not the situations you handle that predict the future, but rather the uncontrollable factors you can't see coming. You gave an example of NHL players and their birth dates in the beginning of the book I found especially intriguing. You mentioned how no matter the age or amount of exposure a player had, they were mostly all born in the early part of January. Your explanation of this was because the cutoff date is right after the New Year for most organizations, so these younger kids would get more playing time then people who missed the cut off date. This would allow them to play against kids in most cases that were older than them by year but not by ability. Because of this, amateur hockey leagues would pick up these players and develop them into today's hockey stars. It proves that in most cases, it is the things you can control that define you. You also brought up the Beatles and what impact their playing experience had on their ability to make it big. It was shown that they had been given an opportunity at a local bar to play 7 hour gigs many times throughout the week. It not only gave them the tools necessary to not be gun-shy when their time came, but it gave them those necessary 10,000 hours to perfect their craft. This is a message that particularly hit home with me, an aspiring musician. I realized at that point that the time I put in practicing my instrument and understanding music was not enough. If I wanted to actually be as close to perfecting an instrument or anything for that matter, I needed to put in close to 10, 000 hours practicing. As of right now, one to two hours a day just will not simply cut it, and I need to dedicate myself more in order to become the best I can be. Something's like the 10,000 hour theory are predictable and at some point obtainable. In music you are always trying to perfect your craft, so when you hear of something that is obtainable, you go for it. The last part of your book I wanted to bring to your attention and discuss with you was Chapter 7: the chapter that explained how many airplane accidents are based off of cultural differences. You made me realize that when cause of an accident is explained, it most likely not the case. It is in fact, normally a series of failures in communication, starting with pilot and co pilot communication. If you are to fly, you must set up the necessary lines of communication. One must make it clear that if there is a situation in which lives are at stake, the co pilot can correct the pilot. I think you provided readers with a valuable life lesson here, in basically saying, for any situation to prove positive, communication must be always open. I thoroughly enjoyed your book, and look to read other literature by you in the future!",2011-03-28
JSALF,4,A Fantastic Read,"A Fantastic Read. Outliers is by far one of the most interesting and unique books I have read, period. The content really makes you stop and analyze the world around you and how everyday occurrences we take for granted can be explained using raw data and statistics. As much as I would have enjoyed reading the book this book on my own, it was also a part of the curriculum for my Senior English class. In our class, almost everything we are learning about revolved around our essential question, which is ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"". You perpetually answer this question in every chapter of his book using many real world examples of people who have found success in their lives by basically being in the right place at the right time. Outliers is unique in the sense that it is unlike any book I have ever read, presenting the information in a factual fashion while leaving room for the reader's mind to wander about to the infinite possibilities that are possible in this world due to certain variables and opportunities presented to someone.
Chapter 3, entitled "" The Trouble With Geniuses Part I"" is one of the chapters that deals with one of the variables that a person can control, which is the 10,000 rule, in which a person must complete 10,000 hours of a certain activity to excel in it. Your real world examples really illustrate the effort necessary to be successful, and how it is one of the few things an individual can control. Chapter 4, ""The Trouble With Geniuses Part 2"", was my personal favorite because it really talks about how those who have the capability to succeed don't always do due to their environment or the opportunities that are presented to them. It made me realize that there is a large amount of luck involved with achieving greatness in any field of work. I also found the first chapter of the book interesting because I have a first-hand experience witnessing what the chapter talks about. Chapter 1 deals with elite Canadian hockey teams and the birthdates of the best players. Players who were born closer to January 1st, which is the birthday cut-off for hockey leagues, were always the biggest and most skilled in their respective leagues. I found this interesting because in my experiences playing hockey, I witnessed players who I both played with and against who were one of the best on their teams and happened to be born towards the beginning of the calendar year, you do a good job laying the foundation for the book in this chapter and proves how certain extenuating circumstances can be directly related to achieving your goals and being successful. 
All in all, Outliers in its entirety is a fantastic read from start to finish, with every chapter giving a fresh and interesting behind-the-scenes look into what really happens when a person finds success in life. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for a new perspective into the world around us and everyday life.

Daviddang28,5,Perfect for High School English class,"Perfect for High School English class. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In our Senior English class, the essential question we are analyzing is, ""To what extent does time and place define a person?"" We have been basing topics and ideas to revolve around this question and analyzing how it does define a person. Therefore, we read your novel, Outliers in which you explain how these factors impact one's success or one's failures through descriptive stories about real life people. Most of the examples portray how time and place can provide opportunities that can lead to a successful life, allowing them to become an ""outlier"". But I believed that three chapters stood out from the rest that seemed the most interesting. In the chapter, ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"", the fact that most professionals had practiced at least a total of 10,000 hours on their talent was fascinating. Practicing a total of 10,000 hours seemed to be the common theme in this chapter because all of the skilled people had that or more while the lesser lacked the same amount of practice. I also agree with this logic because it seems that many people may start out with a bit more of an advantage, but the dedication to strive to become better ultimately separates the skilled from the unskilled. I was also curious to know if there have been any exceptions to this rule, such as a professional pianist who has only had 7,000 hours of practice, but performs just as well as someone with 10,000 hours. Another chapter that was interesting was, ""The Trouble with Geniuses Part II"", which included two different geniuses that had opposite lives because of a skill required through one's environment called practical intelligence. You would expect any genius to master that skill, no matter the cause, but it was Oppenheimer who used this skill to manipulate a situation, while Langan could not. Also, I agree with the results of the study about the lives of wealthier families and poorer families and how it impacts their practical intelligence, because the wealthier parents seem to allow their children to be more independent. After reading Oppenheimer's story, I was curious to know what he said that was so persuasive that allowed him to be excused from jail. Lastly, the chapter, ""Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", was another interesting section about how time really presents opportunities. Flom's cases at the time were considered minor until businesses seized to control one another, which made his cases extremely important and current. Time seems to be the gateway that allowed Flom to become successful. I agree with your logic that some disadvantages could be one's opportunities for success, which is portrayed through the life of Joe Flom. Although, I do wonder if there are many others like Flom because his scenario seems rare. Furthermore, I also enjoyed reading the chapter, ""Rice Paddies and Math Test"", since it related to my own life. I've always viewed my math skills as excellent solely because I was Chinese, but now I understand that many factors contribute to this talent, such as the work ethic of my people. But, although I am Chinese, I do not use the Chinese language so the words are not quicker, which still does not allow me to understand why I am more advanced than others at this subject. Overall, I loved the way you described these situations and how they correlate with our essential question. Sincerely, David Dang",2011-03-28
,5,Must Read!,"Must Read!. Mr. Gladwell This semester in high school our class read your book, Outliers. At first, I thought this was another mundane English book that was part of our curriculum, but I was proved wrong. Outliers allowed me to see the world of success in a whole new perspective compared to what I saw before. In senior English, the course is designed around ourselves and our relation to the world. We explore diversity, religion, and even naming. Our central question of the course asks how time and place define an individual, and I think your book answers that question perfectly. The stories you talked about in the novel each have certain circumstances and problems which influence the development of the character in them, and it really shows how our successes and failures is determinant on not only our ability but also on our environment. To me, the most interesting chapter in your book is Rice Paddies and Math Tests, where you looked into how and why people of Asian descent have higher math scores throughout the world. It was really cool to see how cultural tendencies that are often overlooked can be influential in aspects like education, where usually people correlate ability with effort. I also like the chapter The 10,000 Hour Rule, where you showed how people who have become great in their respective fields have a commonality between them: Practice. Often when people think of the greats such as Bill Gates and The Beatles, they think that those individuals and groups have impeccable talent. But the 10,000 Hour Rule not only makes sense, it's a great way to get people motivated. As the saying goes, ""Practice makes perfect"". The idea that successful individuals have been given opportunities and have made the best of them is hope for us all in different situations. The only question I have about this book is in the chapter Marita's Bargain. I understood the idea that opportunities are the key to success, and that for the world to have more ""Outliers"", we need to get more opportunities to more people. My question is, how would you propose to do this? Do you think that the American education system is showing how its students can take advantage of the opportunities in their country? All in all, I really enjoyed reading Outliers. It was not another mundane English book to trudge through, but rather a stimulating, intellectual novel that built upon facts. I think that the lessons I learned in Outliers will stay with me for a long time to come.",2011-03-28
,4,Chris G.'s Review,"Chris G.'s Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
	Throughout the last semester, my high school English class has been reading and discussing ""Outliers"". For every lesson in this class, we try and tie it to our essential question, which is ""to what extent does time and place define a person?"" In ""Outliers"", this idea of time and place is brought up constantly throughout the book, with you constantly brining up the idea that outliers are the way they are due to the opportunities given to them instead of the commonly believed idea that they are outliers due to natural talent. In several instances in the book, people were given advantages in life based off of the time and/or place in which they were born. This was prevalent in the hockey players getting a large advantage if they are born in the beginning of the year, or even that Bill Gates was born during the right time and in the right place to be a pioneer in the computer industry. I really found both of these chapters interesting, as well as chapter 3 which focused on an IQ threshold.  The first chapter, The Matthew Effect, was a very interesting concept to me. It was a great chapter to start off the book with because it gave a preface for everything to follow by explaining that hockey players born in the beginning of the year have a large advantage over those born later on. This concept makes a lot of sense, but it is just something that I have never really thought about. The second chapter, the 10,000 Hour Rule, was to me the most interesting chapter in the book. It went against all conventional knowledge that people were skilled at something based off of talent, and instead brought up the idea that they are skilled because of how much experience they have. The idea that you will master a field once you have performed 10,000 in it is also an interesting concept, although I do not know how true it is. Even though there are a few examples of it taking people 10,000 hours to master a subject, I still do not feel that value holds true in all circumstances. For example, I am sure that a lot of professional golfers have spent 10,000 hours on the game, and yet no one has come close to mastering it. Every golfer makes mistakes, and I feel that it will never be mastered. So while I think that the rule is a good general rule, it still does not hold true in every situation. Chapter 3's concept of an IQ threshold was also extremely interesting. Before reading this chapter, I had always thought that a higher intelligence would generally directly correlate to a higher level of success. However, after reading the chapter, I entirely agree with your viewpoint. Once the threshold is reached, social skills and networking are necessary to succeed. I have noticed that some people are able to make up for a lack of intelligence with their social skill. Even though someone has not reached the threshold, I believe it is still very possible for them to be more successful than someone who has. A lot of the concepts presented in your book hold true in my experiences with golf. The best players are generally those whose parents also play golf. This gives them an advantage they were born with that generally allows them to develop faster and practice more. This means that someone who is born with less skill but has this advantage can surpass someone with more skill but who lacks this advantage.",2011-03-27

,4,Gladwell's Outliers Connected to the Teachings In a 12th Grade English Class,"Gladwell's Outliers Connected to the Teachings In a 12th Grade English Class. Through the reading of the novel Outliers I have concluded that this particular book contrasts very well with the lessons being taught in my senior English class. Throughout the entire course we are connecting everything we learn to one essential question. To what extent do time and place define a person? I feel that Gladwell's Outliers is a great example of real life situations that connect perfectly to this question. Gladwell talks a lot about success and why and how a person gains it. This is the base of the essential question I am studying in my class because success is one of the main things that defines a person. Every chapter in this book relates to the essential question in one way or another. In the chapter The Three Lessons of Joe Flom, Gladwell focuses mainly on how disadvantages became opportunities. He tells the story of a family living during the depression and how he gained success. The Janklows story focuses on being in the wrong place at the wrong time and how they took advantage of the situation to find the success they needed. I enjoyed how Gladwell told the story of the Janklows and interpreted in his own way. In the chapter Rice Paddies and Math, Gladwell focuses on how hard work and the right opportunities will give a person success. He mentions the Asian society and the work styles they have. Due to where they lived technology was not available which forced them to focus on their work. He states that they worked harder than any other occupation pore modern era. Living in a place with less technological advantages really helped the workers gain the success they were looking for. In the chapter Marita's Bargain, Gladwell turns his attention over to a young girl who is given a chance. Marita's story connects perfectly with the essential question. She is underprivileged and living in poor community with her mom and because of this she is given the opportunity to attend a special school. Due to Marita's living conditions she was given the opportunity to possibly make it somewhere in her life. If she had been living somewhere else she might not of gotten the chance she did. This one change in her life helped define who she is as a person today and changed her life forever. I particularly liked this chapter because I felt it connected the most to the essential question. Marita was given an opportunity because of where she was living and what was going on in her life at the time. The entire book Outliers reflects the essential question I am studying and each chapter has a point in it that can connect perfectly to it.",2011-03-27
,3,Outliers Review,"Outliers Review. Dear Malcolm Gladwell,
	My name is Becca Purtell and I think that the ideas in your book Outliers, relate to the main question that is essential to my English course; to what extent do time and place define a person?  In my class, we have a central question that we focus on throughout the course while reading literature to help us draw connections with what we learn.  The chapters regarding "" the Roseto Mystery"", ""the 10,000 Hour Rule"", and ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"" relate specifically to the central question of my course.
	The Roseto Mystery chapter explains how the Rosetans moved from their homeland and settled in a small city that consisted of people only pertaining to their specific ethnicity.  The chapter clarifies that the Rosetans tended to have a longer life rate than other people in the cities surrounding them.  These Rosetans were not in shape and they smoked &amp; drank, but they showed signs of excellent health.  Even Rosetans in other cities were not as healthy as them.  Research later showed that the reason these Rosetans had such a life rate was because of their lifestyle.  They were friendly and visited each other often.  As many as up to three generations lived in one house and grandparents were received with great esteem. They lived in a carefree environment.  In relation to my essential question, the Rosetans are a perfect example of how place defines a person.  The atmosphere and lifestyle of this particular Rosetan culture enabled many people to live longer than they normally would had they been living in another city or country.
	The 10,000 Hour Rule also relates well to how time and place ultimately define a person.  In this chapter, you claim that one must have 10,000 hours of practice in their trade in order to be successful and make it big.  For example, due to Bill Gates' talent, chance, and opportunity to have free programming time from 3 am- 6 am, he was able to found Microsoft, a computer system used by millions of people daily.   For him, time and place played an extreme role in his success.  Had Bill Gates not lived near the University of Washington, he would not have been able to use the computer labs at 3 am in the morning; hence he would not have been able to achieve his 10,000 hours of experience.  Also, if Gates had not been able to access the free programming at 3 am, he would not have been able to practice his programming.  
	The Three Lessons of Joe Flom is very similar to my essential question regarding time and place.  Specifically, the setting of Joe Flom's life shapes the ways of his actions.  Since he was a Jewish man in New York, he was turned away from many of the New York firms, forcing him to create his own white shoe firm.  The fact that he was Jewish and living in New York during a time when Jewish people were not hired often in big New York firms shows the extent that time and place played on his opportunities.   Also, being born in the right generation was crucial for success.  If you were born during the Great Depression, you had many more opportunities for success because class sizes were smaller, there was less competition for jobs, and it was easier to get into better schools.  This example and statement show how large an impact time and place define someone's opportunity for success.",2011-03-27
DerekNewsome,4,Great Story- Outliers is a must read,"Great Story- Outliers is a must read. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers- ""The Story of Success"" presents simple yet complex scenarios throughout the entire story. I read Gladwell's book during my Senior English class and I was very impressed with the way Malcolm writes. The story line all the way through the book is presented in a very creative, innovative and interesting manner. Gladwell discusses topics of what it takes to be successful, and whether or not summer vacation is a good or bad thing. Two characters that are talked about, Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer are talked about for most of the book. What make these two so interesting is their background stories. Gladwell does a great job comparing these two even though their childhoods were 100% different. The way his thoughts and information is presented are clear and neatly presented. Never once did I lose interest in what I was reading and I wanted to continue reading all the way to the end. You can see the love and passion that Gladwell has for his writing and that what made it so appealing to me and my classmates. There were though a couple things that were confusing and hard to understand. His thoughts are clear as I stated before, but they do become a little puzzling. And as a result of this there is another thing that may be of inconvenience. Some of the sections do become very lengthy and can become a tad boring. Even though the scenarios/topics are of a huge variety, some may seem targeted to only a certain group of people. For me in one instance, Gladwell was talking about summer vacation and whether it is a good thing or bad. He describes the students as the ""rich kids"" or the ""poor kids"" and some readers may find that as a little offensive. The final thing that I found confusing was Gladwell would present an idea, discuss it for some time and then move on to another and leave you wondering what happen with that topic. But in all, Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers- The Story of Success"" is exactly what the title says, successful.",2011-03-27

ColleenFida,4,Colleen's Review,"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell,
	After reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success.  The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom.
	""The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! 
	 ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? 
	In ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",2011-03-27
,3,"""Success"" seen in a new light","""Success"" seen in a new light. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, various stories of individuals who achieved success in several different ways are highlighted. In the ""10,000 hours"" chapter, Gladwell expresses the mantra ""practice equals perfect."" If you work, you will achieve success. I, too, believe in this concept. However, one of Gladwell's implications within the chapter is that if one does not start pursuing a talent or goal at a young age, one will not be successful. He also says if an inadequate amount of hours are put into one's pursuit, achieving success will, too, be.unsuccessful. I personally believe if one works hard, and truly wants to attain success, they will. If they start at 30 or do not put 10,000+ hours into their endeavor, it isn't the end of the world. There is still hope and great probability that they will be successful. Another chapter that sparked my interest was ""The Matthew Effect."" In this chapter, Gladwell uses statistics to express one's age greatly affects their success. He does so by analyzing hockey players. The children, who are the older ones in the cut-off, seem to show a greater amount of skill than those who are younger. Yes, this may be a coincidence, but I personally think this is only due to the fact that they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. Here, the older children are given special opportunities. This then accumulates to bring greater success. ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests"" was another chapter that significantly interested me. Gladwell, in this section, explains because of Asians' language and cultural background, they are better at math and work extremely hard overall. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more commonsensical than Western languages. Therefore, Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than those of the American descent. Another argument behind his theory has to do with the significant amount of labor and strength farming rice entailed for Asians. Gladwell says that the Asian culture is overall more hardworking because of the immense amount of work had to be put in to producing rice paddies, and have consequently been shaped by their ancestors to work hard. I do see validity in Gladwell's points, but I can also easily pose arguments that go against what he says. As a student who has been in honors classes all her life, I have seen the broad spectrum of students who enroll in these higher-level classes. Yes, there are Asians present in the majority of these classes, but there are many Whites and Blacks as well. I firmly believe that all students, regardless of ethnicity, have to put in the same amount of work; The Asian culture and background does not give Asian students a predisposition to the importance of endurance and perseverance. When all is said and done though, Outliers was a very interesting read. Some chapters interested me more than others, but the book as a whole forced me to see the concept of ""success,"" as well as its make-up, in a new light. Growing up in the US, we are always told that ""as long as we work hard, we will be successful."" However, Gladwell presents his case for hard work as being not the only determinant of success.",2011-03-27

KH78,4,Outliers,"Outliers. In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell relates the success of hockey players, software programmers, the Beatles, geniuses, Jewish-American lawyers, pilots, Asians, and underprivileged students to being in the right place at the right time, receiving special opportunities, and working hard. According to Gladwell, outliers are ""products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is...grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luck"" (285). In my opinion, Gladwell shows that outliers are not all that different from other people at the start of their careers. They are just lucky enough to come across certain opportunities throughout their lives that bring them success. In fact, Gladwell believes that outliers are not really outliers at all. ""The Matthew Effect"" is one of my favorite chapters. Throughout the chapter, Gladwell uses statistical analysis to show that athletic and educational age cut-offs greatly affect one's success. Older children in the cut-offs seem to show more ""talent"" than those who are younger, but that is only because they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. As a result, the older children are given special opportunities, which accumulate and bring success. I also like ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" In this section, Gladwell explains that Asians are better at math because of their language and culture. He presents many valid points. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more logical than Western languages so Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than their American counterparts. Once again, this initial advantage results in an ""accumulative advantage,"" in which Asians like math more, try harder, and perform better. Although I agree with most of his arguments, Gladwell excludes any information that contradicts his points. For example, any sports fan can probably list famous athletes who were born right before the cutoff date. I personally know successful people who are the youngest on their team or in their class. I also know of non-Asian people who are excellent at math. Albert Einstein was European, yet he is remembered as a genius of mathematics and physics. Unfortunately, Gladwell does not include any of these exceptions to his rules in ""The Matthew Effect"" and ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests."" Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading Gladwell's book. Although some of the chapters moved slowly, it was a fast read overall. Gladwell's stories encouraged me to look at success from a different perspective. Living in the United States, I have been reminded all of my life about the ""American dream"" and told that as long as I work hard, I will be successful. However, as Gladwell theorizes, hard work is not the only determinant of success.",2011-03-26

That being said, it was an interesting read. I felt he had relevant points and research to back up his opinion (though there is research for every opinion). I agree with his overall point, which is nurture plays a larger role than nature. He takes a rather cynical approach though and rules out desire and the will to achieve something. Of course, the circumstances need to be right for something to happen, but I believe if you have the will you will find those circumstances.

With all these tricks of the trade that Gladwell explains, with enough practice can help you excel in anything you dream.

Review:
Through this intelligent business journey described in ""Outliers"", Gladwell sets a fine line for the most potential in the business world today. Malcolm Gladwell's most repeated and stressed points are, to pay attention to the little things, and think about the bigger picture as your journey through life goes on. But to get this picture you need to practice and practice. Once you reach the 10,000 hour mark, you can experience your glory in the business. Throughout this story little points are hinted, and sometimes the little things in life turn out to be the biggest in your career.",2010-12-07

sandiek,5,Interesting Theories Of Success,"Interesting Theories Of Success. In Outliers, The Story Of Success, Malcolm Gladwell shows research that puts forward the theory that success is a combination of factors.  While intelligence plays a large part, so do birth order, cultural assumptions, and above all hard work.  Individuals must have the ability to see opportunities and then have the skills to take advantage of them.

One of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players.  They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year.  Inexplicable coincidence?  No, more likely that this phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed.  Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams.

This plays out over and over again when trends are seen.  The dot-com millionaires?  Almost all were born from 1952-1955, when the computer was first introduced to the public, and kids in schools could get hours upon hours of programming time.  Successful musicians?  Most practice hundreds more hours than those who just never quite make it to the top.  Both groups are talented, but one group takes advantage of opportunities and hard work to develop that talent.

In one study, bright children in California were tested and tracked for over forty years.  Although all started in the brightest groups, by adulthood they had fallen into the superstars, the average and those who didn't quite make it.  Luck of the draw?  That assumption can be challenged when the facts show that those in the bottom group almost overwhelmingly had parents who were uninvolved in their lives and who didn't help their children focus and refine their talents.  Parenting styles seem to make a big difference.

Gladwell has written a thought-provoking book.  His thesis can be summed up in this quote: ""...success follows a predictable course.  It is not the brightest who succeed.  Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf.  It is, rather, a gift.  Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ...To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all.""  This book is recommended for readers that are interested in learning how the world works and how we might improve it.",2010-11-28

ccamp,5,"Superb, intelligent, fascinating: everyone should read this book!","Superb, intelligent, fascinating: everyone should read this book!. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most educated, eye-opening, reader friendly books I have ever read. And that's saying something. Being thirteen years old, many books relating to this topic are quite complex and hard to understand. However, Outliers has understandable comparisons and simpler topics in a way that makes it comprehendible but interesting at the same time. Now don't go thinking this is a simple, seventh grade read. It's not. Outliers is sophisticated and intelligent.
	In this succulent statistical story of success, Malcolm Gladwell talks about the outliers of humanity: Bill Gates, Joe Flom, Christopher Langan, and so on. He discusses why Asians are good at math, ""The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes"" (title of chapter seven), and what really happens over summer vacation for high poverty and upper class. And most of all, he talks about their stories. According to Outliers, there is no such thing as ""rags to riches."" All those remarkable and extremely successful people got where they were by some chance, and ten thousand hours of practice. Ten thousand hours. That's the magic number. If you get that many hours of doing something, then you will be a master. However, it takes more than drive to get to this ambitious goal: you have to the opportunity to reach it. It just so happened that Bill Gates's school was one of the first to have a computer terminal, and it just so happened that he lived right by the University of Washington which just so happened to also have a computer terminal with free hours from three to six, and so on and so on. 
I only have one argument with Malcolm Gladwell on his book. He forgot to account for genetics and the exceptional person's drive that makes him want to spend every possible moment programming on a computer. How would Joe Flom have become one of the most successful lawyers in America if he hadn't tried hard at school and worked hard enough to get into Harvard Law. Yes, these people had outstanding chances, but without their drive, they would be nowhere.
	I loved Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell did his homework. He uses graphs, charts, and illustrations to convey his point. He gives real-life examples of experiments. Malcolm Gladwell is just right. Outliers changed my world.",2010-10-19

VTSkiKid,4,Intriguing,"Intriguing. Have you ever been jealous of someone else's success or wanted to be as successful as some wealthy or talented celebrity?  According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book, Outliers, chances are if you were born at the right time of the year, and the right time of the century, have luck on your side and are willing to work lots, you, too, can be on the cover of Forbes Magazine.  In short, if you thought success was all about being innately amazing, this book will change your thinking. And even better, I recommend this book, with only a few reservations.
The first chapter of the book talks about why almost all pro hockey players are born in the first three to four months of the year.   A large part of hockey is being able to push each other around.  Therefore being older and most often bigger than others is a huge advantage.   These older and therefore bigger kids then get chosen for the travel team with the best coach and they get the most playtime. And after a few seasons of preferential treatment these kids are superior.
Another huge part of success, that is largely unexplainable, is straight up luck.  Why did Bill Gates's middle school's mothers' club choose to buy a state of the art computer?  What if he had been born just two years earlier and the technology did not exist when he got to middle school?  Or what if he had been born two years later so that by the time he was in middle school, the demand for computers was so high that it was tough for kids to get time on the system?  He might not have gotten all that time that he easily snatched right up.  As you can see much of success is pure luck.  But the biggest reason Bill Gates succeeded is because he went on to practice his programming.
Just because of when you are born does not trump practice, and the book even agrees.  For example, if you have 10,000 hours of practice by the time you are eighteen, you will be a pro at what you are doing.  Want some real world examples? Just look at Tiger Woods, Bill Gates or Bill Joy.  The amount that Bill Gates and Bill Joy worked from the time they started programming in late middle and early high school is enormous.  The stories that Joy tells of all the time he put in programming blows your mind when you realize there was absolutely nothing else going on in this kid's life.  This young programmer and his colleagues loved what they did.  So they did it lots, and lots and lots! And, look at them now, they're really successful.
I would definitely recommend this book particularly to students because of the stress that some undergo from worrying about the future.  But I will warn you, it may get a bit tedious at points.  Gladwell's writing can go off in tangents.  However, I'm glad I read it and was able to add some awesome information to my repertoire.  So go ahead, read on!",2010-09-10

BigLar81,3,Practice makes perfect!,"Practice makes perfect!. I always thought that certain people posses traits which make them better at somethings than most. But this book does a great job dispelling this type of thinking. The stats are striking and make sense. A good read in my opinion for all readers. I still think that some people are just naturally better at things, especially sight or peripheral vision which make them better at sports than most, but practice could account for that as well. This books goes into the background of why people are better at things. It makes sense.",2010-08-29

PR_Gal,5,This book rocked my world!,"This book rocked my world!. Mr. Gladwell makes some stunning observations. My childhood Pollyanna ideals that if you just work really hard, wealth would be easy are now replaced with real ideals. It's more than hard work - it's timing, circumstance, luck, and more. The chapter on plane crashes is absolutley fascinating. I didn't need to make it required reading for my staff - they enthusiastically embraced it with a sigh and a ""wow!"" when they finished. The chapter is an extreme example of communication across cultures. As communicators in a diverse community, my team now has a new understanding and approach to cross-culture communication. This book will make great Christmas gifts to my kids in college. I sure wish I had this book when I was in college! I recommend this book wholeheartedly!",2010-08-26

ALnoor,2,Its not as simple as that.,"Its not as simple as that.. In Outliers, Gladwell tries to pinpoint the logic behind people's success. According to Gladwell, no longer does success stream from high IQ or self-intelligence, but more from a legacy and luck. As Gladwell puts it ""it's being in the right place at the right time"". In a nutshell - opportunity + hard work = success 
According to Outliers, achieving success is solving a formula, but can achieving success be as clear-cut as this? Of course not.
Personally, I couldn't really get into this book. Though it did have some very interesting points I had not thought of, the book runs off on way to many tangents that only lead to illogical conclusions with a deep lack of practical intelligence. 
As a writer, Gladwell has a comfortable and flowing writing style. Though outliers is an engaging read at times, I would stay away unless I want to get bombarded with illogical conclusions and boring unrelated facts.",2010-05-20

mls123,5,Great book for discussion groups,"Great book for discussion groups. ""Intelligence matters only up to a point.Other things-things that have nothing to do with intelligence-must start to matter more.""The ""other things""the author examines are the external factors,the""X""factors, which account for personal success-these include,among many examples, the birth month of youth hockey players,the proximity of a young Bill Gates to one of the first college computer centers,the random acceptance of a child from a poor neighborhood into a charter school.Gladwell is a master storyteller, and his own ""outlier"" story at the book's end is gripping.An excellent book to combine with this is David Shenk: The Genius In All of Us, which examines the internal factors responsible for success.Combined, these two books explain the secrets behind high achievers.It's important to note that Gladwell is a journalist, not a social scientist. He makes sweeping conclusions based on anecdotal evidence and is highly selective in the examples he uses. Shenk's book, The Genius In All of Us, on the other hand, is well-documented;in fact,his bibliography is almost as long as his texts.Both authors agree that success is not genetically determined.",2010-05-14

After reading BLINK, I was hoping that this work of Gladwell's wouldn't be as dry and difficult to read.  It definitely wasn't.  I learned the meaning of an outlier - never heard the term before - and agreed with some of his theories of family influence and opportunities knocking.  However, I disagreed with others, such as the oldest children in a class having the most lead time in growth, hence athletic abilty, agility, intellectual development.  As the mother of two sons who played professional baseball, I cannot attest to the latter theory, since it would apply to one son with an early birthday, but not to his brother, who advanced in the professional leagues well beyond his older brother and had a much later birthday.",2010-05-06

,5,It's All About the Opportunities,"It's All About the Opportunities. I have always wondered how extremely successful people have done it. I figured they were just really good at what they do and they worked really hard. Gladwell explains that, yes, they did put in 10,000 hours of hard work, but they also had many opportunities that led them to their success. Bill Gates had the opportunity to spend hours with a computer doing computer programming while he was in eighth grade. He was therefore way ahead of all his peers in the technology department and was able to create Microsoft. It's not that Bill Gates was ridiculously smarter than everybody, he just had more opportunities than them. Gladwell does a great job of explaining that success is not just how one individual worked hard to get where they are. He explains that it matters what year someone was born and where they came from. Outliers, as in the people that are so much more successful than the average person, are not necessarily the smartest ones; they are the ones that had the most opportunities. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's and I will definitely be reading the others.",2010-04-29

Angela2932ND,4,What Price Success?,"What Price Success?. All of Gladwell's books have been fascinating reads! This book is making me think about my own growing up years/culture/class background, and the impact on my life decisions. It makes me think about decisions I've made regarding my children, and how my husband and I bring our different life stories to bear on this. Gladwell has a way of presenting social psychology through a very engaging format. The main thesis of this book is that success is an accumulation of advantages, coupled with the ""10,000 hour rule.""  The book does get to be repetitive, but is entertaining enough to make it feel worth it. I didn't alway agree with his perspective, however. An example is in presenting the KIPP schools, and the role of the extensive hours devoted to studies as a meaure of the success of the students. What bothered me about this is that it does not take into consideration the cultural context of the students, and whether this success comes at too great a cost. I would have liked to see the ""you can be successful if you put in 10,000 hours"" tempered by also raising the question of whether the ""success"" is really worth it and what such success means in terms of one's identity, value system, or other lost opportunities.",2010-04-21

Utilizing true stories woven to prove his theory, Gladwell manages to envelope the reader into situations and true stories of the success of people such as Bill Gates. Gladwell's tales spin a story that convinces the reader of the phenomenon of the ""outlier"" and leaves you with this message: if you've found success in life, it's not just due to hard work or intelligence. You can thank a whole string of people who gave you gifts along the way, in the form of chances, which ultimately impact your success.",2010-04-19

His explanations answered questions lurking in my mind, and his theories, if heeded, can indeed help one to understand how success--defined in different ways--can be achieved.  Additionally Gladwell is a writer--a man whose words flow with style, a quality deeply appreciate.  I'm not giving anything away when I say he truly saved the best for last--don't skip ahead, but know you're going to read the last chapter with a smile on your face.  I quickly recommended it to others, went to buy another Gladwell book, ""Blink,"" and have to finish this review before I sit down with that book in my hands--I may not want to put it down.",2010-04-08

BeachGirl_in_the_Big_City,5,Love this Book,"Love this Book. I am a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell. I actually started with this book and then read the rest of his previous works. This is a fantastic read. I was a psychology major so it was very relevant to what I had studied as well as everyday life. Outliers examines how those individuals who achieved success were a product of their environments and life circumstances. On the one hand it's disappointing to think that hard work isn't enough but on the other hand I like the idea that sometimes if someone fails to succeed it isn't because they didn't work hard enough or that they weren't qualified, it might just be a product of their circumstances. I love the way Gladwell uses scientific experiments to justify his claims. It gives more validity to the book than if it were just his ideas.

Because of this book I have a more positive outlook on things. I've been inspired to find my strengths in the cards that life has dealt me and to focus on those strengths rather than waste time on ambitions that may never be realized.

Gladwell is simply an amazing writer.  His books make you want more and more.  His thesis here about opportunities being given to people by virtue of circumstance has great applicability with respect to early tracking of students, athletes and any other endeavor where kids are grouped early in life and especially within twelve month blocks of time.  However, the thesis is clearly incomplete because it fails to explain why different people who are given the same situational opportunities are unequally able to take advantage of them: that is, there must be some role for innate ability and other situational benefits that are not the product of history and time period.  (i.e., a highly motivated descendant of Irish farm workers [not European Jewish garment worker]) who struggles to maintain an atmosphere of high dedication to learning and achievement in the home and produces a child who founds a large law firm who was not born in the early 1930s)  Gladwell can be forgiven, however, because his ideas do add to the discourse of factors that go into mega-success.  I will also apply them as ""the system"" attempts to track my own son when he enters school, athletics, music, art, etc.  ""Outliers"" still gets the five stars from me because Gladwell is such a highly engaging writer.",2010-02-21

Michellealysha,4,Are There True Outliers?,"Are There True Outliers?. Who would have ever thought that the Beatles, star athletes, and Bill Gates would have something in common? Most would think all they have in common is what meets the eye: their wealth. No, it's the fact that they are all outliers. In the book Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, Gladwell challenges their ""success"" by asking why was it so easy for these individuals? Gladwell uses data and facts that the ""average Joe"" can understand. Gladwell shows that the road to success isn't just determination and talent; it's also opportunities and social class. Gladwell shows that some successful people aren't just outliers; they are given advantages by circumstance, social class, and culture that you and I may not have.
	Gladwell has a smooth writing style that is easily read. If you wanted a fluid, quick, and interesting book, I would recommend Outliers. It was fun to read and made me question if I was given these rare circumstances, who the person I could be if I was given all of the opportunities the ""outliers"" received. Outliers in a motivational and uplifting book about ordinary people who, given extraordinary circumstances, made the best out of it. Any book that has a good message like that gets a ""thumbs up"" from me. Gladwell uses a lot of charts, tables and other eye catching graphic items in his book to keep the reader not only entertained, but also to demonstrate that he is not just making up his data about the outliers. I really enjoyed how different outliers were discussed in same chapter to show their similarities. Gladwell also does a good job researching his topics including quotes from outliers and subject experts on the given subjects and people. He keeps an upbeat tone throughout the book and always proves his point thoroughly.
	But with by proving his point so thoroughly, sometimes I was bored with all of the facts. While the book wouldn't be the same without all the facts, sometimes the point was overstated and redundant. Some may like the thoughtful thoroughness of the writing but I believed him and was in awe of the facts in short order. I would have liked to see how an average person could actually become lucky, a true outlier; but this of course would contradict the book. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to see someone who truly ""earned their stripes."" 
	Outliers is a book for anyone who has ever wondered why some excel while others just fit into the norm. It is a captivating book for anyone who wants to read about an engaging topic that gets into the heads of the world's elite members. The book is a book of success, and good fortune, for those who receive it. Outliers reminds us all to be all that we can be because we have been given certain circumstances or, as Gladwell states from the Matthew Effect, ""opportunities that lead to further success""  If you like an upbeat informative read the keeps you yearning for more, I would hands down recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.",2010-02-08
,2,Was There a Point to Outliers?,"Was There a Point to Outliers?. The disappointing and monotonous book, Outliers, did not deserve to be on the Top Seller's List, at least in my mind.  The repetitive style of writing that Malcolm Gadwell chose to use ended up losing its impact within the first three chapters.  His outdated examples and confusing thought process turned the somewhat interested youth away.
The story starts out with a little spunk and a new way of looking at something.  An open mind is necessary because buying into his thoughts is key to enjoying the message.  The challenge of keeping an open mind served to be a good lesson for future readings, and necessary to liking his book.  The beginning is intriguing and leaves you with the feeling of wanting more.  All of his evidence is backed up with solid sources and further validates his point, but this interesting style of writing doesn't last for long.
As the story goes on Gladwell continues to say the same facts over and over, and doesn't satisfy the reader's feeling of wanting more. For example in the beginning of the story Gladwell touches on the fact that opportunities and time of birth are essential to success.  There is a long and satisfying chapter about this subject in the beginning.  Just when you thought a new idea would be introduced you keep getting hit with the same idea.  Gladwell mentions opportunities and time of birth in almost every chapter.  He not only shows how it helped this person, but goes on to explain it yet again.
Unlike most stories there was no conclusion to his ideas.  Gladwell did not organize his thoughts; furthermore, resulting in a confusing book.  By not keeping his readers interested Gladwell failed to communicate the message that he was trying to send.  Gladwell needed to be more convincing, brief and interesting in order to pull in his readers.",2010-02-08

JayHigh,2,Interesting but author promotes redistribution of wealth,"Interesting but author promotes redistribution of wealth. Gladwell presents very interesting and insightful information in the first few chapters which were quite interesting. However, as I read further, it was increasingly evident  Gladwell has an obvious left wing agenda which contaminates some of his very interesting findings. It was especially evident when he mentioned a study which showed black graduates of Michigan Law School ,despite having much lower grades in colleges and LSAT scores are as successful as their white fellow graduates. His premise is there is a threshold of talent or IQ which must be met to be at the top of a chosen field or profession. He rightfully states how much time those who meet the this threshold practice or study is as important as natural talent or IQ. He then promotes the idea that a school like Harvard should set a threshold and then choose who is admitted by a lottery. But there are well known problems with this approach. To meet standards of political correctness, there have numerous cases where the threshold was set artificially or ridiculously low to ensure the ""correct"" percentages of each race enters the school or the job in question. In addition, how could anyone guarantee the ""lottery"" is a real lottery. The study he sites uses some criteria which are very subjective. I liked his book until I realized he is an Obama type, who is bright, convincing but in the end has an agenda of redistribution of income ,power, prestige etc. Sorry Malcolm I should have left the book in B&amp;N when I saw you are a staff writer for the New Yorker.",2010-01-10

Wallyplays,5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"One of the best books I've ever read!. This is an amazing book.  Even before I finished reading it I began to  share it with family, friends, and co-workers.  No matter what you do in life--this book will help you to see your place in the world more clearly.  I don't think I'm the only one who wonders at how I ended up where I am, or why certain things connect with me while others simply drift on past.  Truly--THIS BOOK IS FOR EVERYONE!  

I teach Jr. High, and the relevance of this book to my classroom, the kids I teach and those I work with--is simply astounding.  I come from a big family, and the way this book helped me to understand my parents and siblings better, while helping me see how to better those relationships is truly remarkable.  

Gladwell forces us to rethink our evaluations of successful people--and how we measure and judge ourselves against the world.  If you have ever wondered why you aren't more successful at the things you apply yourself to, or want to know why some people seem to always make it while others don't--READ THIS BOOK!  If you just want to understand yourself a little bit better--how you think, why you might think a certain way, and why you are sometimes at odds with others, pick up a copy of this book and just enjoy the read.  If you're the least bit of a closet author--this is also the book that will make you say, ""I wish I wrote like Malcom Gladwell.""  But for now, I will be satisfied that at least he writes this way.  

Thank you Mr. Gladwell.  Yours' is truly a rare gift.",2009-12-19

Kataman1,4,Fascinating Information but Limited Self-Help,"Fascinating Information but Limited Self-Help. As many people at work were raving about this book I needed to read it for myself. I was a little reluctant at first because of some of the Amazon reviews saying that Gladwell culled information from a lot of studies and that the reader would be better served going to some of those studies themsleves. 

Gladwell has done an excellent job of poring through mountains of data and presented many of these studies in a concise way that can be understood by any layman. Most of the information is presented in a logical and interesting progression. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it in the same way when I am flipping channels and I see something marvelous structure being built on a Discovery Channel show. 

Though the information is fascinating and I enjoyed reading most of the book, I wonder if this is really a ""self-help"" book or not. The first few chapters talk about how successful people are made. Having not been born in the first three months of the year, I already missed the first level of success. Not having 1,000 hours available to master something new, I missed the next idea. I was not born in the ideal years for success in the computer field (1952-1955) and my parents were not clothing makers in Eastern Europe. 

I was not born Asian so I will never have the mastery of math that someone that speaks and Asian language has from the time they started first learning numbers. Then the chapter on the likelihood of a crash based on ethnic background makes one be more frightened to fly on one of the airlines that may have a pilot and copilot from a ""class-laden"" country. I assume that the studies and new training methods have since reduced these risks. 

What it all comes down to is that this is a fun read and I definately recommend the book because the reader will find most of it fascinating. But there is very little information that can be used for those that want a ""self-help"" manual to be successful.",2009-12-14

GSJ,5,Subtlety of Becoming Success,"Subtlety of Becoming Success. Although Gladwell suggests his book contradicts the notion of the self-made man, he demonstrates again and again how education and continuing pursuit of interim goals creates the path toward it.  Rather than coming away with the sense that luck would stack the cards for extraordinary success, though we are shown just how that has happened in many cases, we come away with the sense our endeavors do make a difference, a big difference, in our success.  What lingers is the 10,000 hour rule which is the effort it takes to become really great at anything, and the improvement which can be made in one's education by studying more hours in the day, more days in the year.  This is a very hopeful story about the workings of success, yes full of luck, present in our lives all the time.  Very compelling read deconstructing the lives of many true outliers to success - those who made it big 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 times greater than the next guy.",2009-09-22

Gladwell looks at the factors that have led to the development of outliers and makes some conclusions that the circumstances surrounding their lives were more important than talent and hard work.  

It is an interesting read because his examples include familiar people like Bill Gates and the Beatles.  It does get a little tedious as the author goes into great detail making his case that pilots sometimes need to overcome their cultural backgrounds to become successful pilots.  But overall, his writing is thought provoking and applicable to us all.",2009-07-12
hwonglam,4,"Entertaining, motivating - an easy read","Entertaining, motivating - an easy read. I have always liked Malcolm Gladwell's books, and this book is no exception. I have recommended this book to my teenage children, and both of them have enjoyed the book. 

The book derives from many resources, and draws on many interesting anedotal evidences. While the anecdotes definitely make the book very easy to read and often very entertaining, they are nonetheless sometimes over-extended to 'prove' a point. Although I was very interested in the innovative rice-paddy hypothesis that Malcolm Gladwell proposes to explain the high success rate of Chinese children in Mathematics, I had a hard time to believe in this theory as the root cause. I say this, despite the fact that I was a good math student and graduated from an engineering school, and am of Chinese descent. Nonetheless, the many anecdotes used often substantiate the main theme of the book very well. However, compared to Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"", this book is more entertaining than authoritative. 

Despite these shortcomings, I still highly recommend the book, because of its motivational value and its highly readable style and content. The theme is clear. As long as we are average or slightly above average in IQ (110 or above), what differentiates between success and failure is lots of hard work and practices, and being there at the right time and right place. By definition, nearly half of all of us possess the intellect to excel. Whether we eventually are successful depend partially on luck, but also much on our motivation and how much we want to succeed.

Other than this book, I would recommend interested readers to also read Geoff Colvin's ""Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else"".

And advocating hard work without the other ancilliary opportunities available to affluent kids is much more likely to create ""hard working drones"" than it is to create outliers, the way Gladwell discusses them in the beginning of the book.

Oscar_Aguilar,5,Hard work and emotional intelligence,"Hard work and emotional intelligence. I've always been curious about the archetypal ""overachieving"" type; the person with a 4.0 GPA, supplemented with a vast resume of extracurriculars and seemingly guaranteed placement at some selective, elite institution. They seem to effortlessly master their studies, creating a very bothersome imposition in the back of my mind that made me feel inadequate. For awhile, I felt that there was something innate these certain individuals possessed, hardening my fatalistic perspective about the world and making me question my own self-worth. 

Gladwell essentially put everything into perspective for me. People aren't just born ""with it."" The typical stories describing the ascent to success by prominent individuals oftentimes, if not always, obscure the social, cultural, economic, institutional and fortuitous elements that allow that person to rise in the first place. This book, replete with credible substantiations, investigates the lives of many successful people, like Bill Gates and Joe Flom, and show how particular environmental factors and fortunate circumstances led to the realization of these individuals' potential. The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches."" This book comprehensively examines not just individuals, but systems (like public education), and stereotypes (such as Asians being good at math) to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of what provides the proper foundation for high achievement. 

Though, let me be clear: this book does *NOT* suggest that sheer hard work is somehow irrelevant, or weakly relevant (i.e. ""it's all luck""), in one's pursuit of success. To the contrary, this book emphatically illustrates how crucial hard work is to the fulfillment of success. The book, however, indicates that hard work goes hand-in-hand with opportunity. Your intellectual potential might have you be a great computer programmer, mathematician, or businessman. Unfortunately, it might very well go to waste without the resources needed to foster the development of such potential. There's no point in having a warehouse of hardy seeds without the fertile soil to plant them in. 

This book has inspired me to push onward with my studies, to work incredibly hard towards mastery of subject material and to seek opportunity and claim it upon arrival. Highly recommended book! 

Another on the subject I tore through recently and recommend strongly in addition to Gladwell's book, because it's great and it includes an online test of your emotional intelligence is, Emotional Intelligence 2.0.",2009-06-19

neilod47,4,The Avant-Garde View of Success,"The Avant-Garde View of Success. ""No one-not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses-ever makes it alone."" That, at least, is the view of renowned sociologist and writer Malcolm Gladwell. In his latest book, ""Outliers: The Story of Success,"" he questions common assumptions about achievement. For example, he argues that there is no such thing as the ""self-made"" man. His conclusions, though rooted in common sense and sociological studies, are often unconventional. You may be surprised to discover that your upbringing and even your birthday have just as much of an influence on success as your IQ or work ethic.

Outliers is not a self-help book. It offers very little practical advice on ""how to succeed."" Rather, it takes an impersonal and sociological (though no less entertaining) approach to success. You will, however, be surprised at how much you can get out of Gladwell's writings. Although it does not give the reader a significantly greater knowledge about how to succeed, Outliers will definitely put into perspective the excessive emphasis that our society places on ""success.""",2009-05-15
ph91,3,Outliers: The Story of Success,"Outliers: The Story of Success. ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting account of the life paths of several very special people - ""outliers"", as Gladwell calls them. He focuses on the reasons for their success, keying in on the factors that are usually overlooked when we examine their lives. While he does not deny that a lot of people's success comes from their own hard work and their personality, Gladwell adds that his ""outliers"" should be most thankful for two main elements: opportunity and legacy. He splits his book into two parts accordingly.

Opportunity, Gladwell says, is really all about luck and how you seize your chances. Citing such famous outliers as Bill Gates, The Beatles, and J Robert Oppenheimer, the author shows just how these men were able to seize their opportunities on their way to success. A lot of it was luck, where the men were just at the right place at the right time. But the main idea was that these men worked at everything they did. Gladwell introduces his ""10,000 hour rule"" as the true key to being world-class in your field. 

The second part of the book focuses on legacy, and how specific groups, based on where their ancestors came from and what they did, are best suited for different jobs. Gladwell writes about the early struggles of Korean pilots, and why Asians are so good at math because of working on rice paddies. Our legacies have a great impact on the way we think and act.

Gladwell's book is an interesting tale of the circumstances needed for success in the world. Its discussions of the important values we must hold and the reasons behind them can surely help out anyone looking for inspiration, and teaches us to seize our opportunities and understand our legacies.",2009-05-15
,5,"""Outliers"": insight into performance and success","""Outliers"": insight into performance and success. I was very impressed with Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers."" He brought into focus things I've often thought were the case, but couldn't prove: namely success has everything to do with the artificial barriers society puts up, not to foster success, but to limit achievement opportunities to those who already have the resources behind them. For example: A case could be made against high school advisors who fail to advise and help students who want to go to college, not because of their grades or test scores, but because of their race, gender or parent's financial status.   Who should read this book? Those overhauling the ""No Child left Behind"" program and all teachers, administrators and others concerned that the US education system is falling behind. State testing programs really only help those who are not proficient (and may never be, regardless of the resources being heaped upon them!); it does little to help those that have the potential to excel and be leaders. We fail these individuals miserably!!
My only criticism of the book, is that it largely focuses on males. Most of the examples could be generalized for females, but the ommission was conspicuous by its absence.",2009-05-13

,4,Outliers written by Malcolm Gladwell,"Outliers written by Malcolm Gladwell. Finding a way to success can be achieved from reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers.  Throughout the book, the theme of achievement drives the reader to want to learn more about how to obtain it.  From this, Gladwell then proves his point of the meaning of an outlier, someone who has been given an opportunity and uses it to their full advantage.   Tips of how to gain success are then given which motivate the reader, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything""(40 Gladwell).  Real situations are given with proven research, which leads Gladwell to making inferences on the true meaning of accomplishment, ""Successful people don't do it alone.  Where they come from matters.  They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell).  The highest intelligence is not required to be successful; it is all based on opportunity, hard work, and support.  Along with many other facts, this proposal is expanded even more throughout the book.  
	After reading the book I felt like I had gained something from it.  I recommend this book for the reason that it kept me interested the whole time.  The context was inspiring and very informative.  Everyone can relate to the theme of this book being success.   However, I recommend this book for teenagers and adults, who might be making decisive life or career decisions.

Outliers was recommended by someone who's accomplishments I greatly admire as having a provocative thesis about success.  Enjoyed this book more than Tipping Point; it is more personal and has a very uplifting conclusion. We are all outliers -- anyone, with perserverance and opportunity, may be successful.  Organized as a series of bios and stories about highly successful -- but not necessarily famous --people, including Bill Gates, to make points about opportunity. Opportunity is not equal according to Gladwell but it is critical to high levels of success.  Reading this book gave me a new way to look at and think about what happens to students in schools, and workers in the workplace.  It isn't only aptitude or luck that makes the difference!",2009-04-13

Replete with anecdotes, studies and statistics, The Outliers is fast-paced and highly interesting. One can argue with the validity of some of his examples. Are you a reader who enjoys quibbling with an author whom you admire?

,4,"Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers","Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers. An outlier is one who has reached achievement in a way that was given as only a chance for them to take.  Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers, is a captivating written work by involving many real life situations.  Not only does it involve Gladwell's own inferences on the success of life, but with the aid of real scenarios that help prove his point.  The initial reaction to the word, outlier is not that of Gladwell's.  Throughout the book, the meaning of the word outlier to Gladwell, is expressed as people who are those who have been given opportunities, and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.  
       The book is a guideline and proof of how success is reached.  The theme guides Gladwell into motivating subject.  He starts with the point that professional athletes are where they are at because of when their birthday falls in the year.  The ones with birthdays at the beginning of the year have an advantage with size and therefore more practice times and better teams are given to them from the initiation. Gladwell believes that, ""Success is the result of what sociologists like to call accumulative advantage"" (30 Gladwell).  With charts of the professional athletes birthdates, he proves his point.  
	Gladwell continues the idea by explaining that success is not just handed to individuals.  A computer programmer doesn't just already have the knowledge of how to create life long used software from the day they were born.  The practice and hard work, is requisite to acquire the skill.  From this Gladwell, comes up with the ten thousand hours rule.  After questioning many of today's profitable people, one being Bill Gates, Gladwell finds out that all of those people practiced what had made them who they are today for at least ten thousand hours,  ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything"" (40 Gladwell).
	This book wasn't just loaded with interesting facts.  With encouraging advice the book, provided examples and research of ways that accomplishments can be reached.  By starting out in life with the highest IQ, isn't always the lead way to getting ahead.  Gladwell talked about studies done on those who started life with the higher intelligence and ended up nowhere.
       Gladwell almost gives a sense of hope for those who are average in intelligence.  That is why I recommend this book; because of Gladwell's reasoning that success comes from opportunity, excess of hard work, some start of intelligence not necessarily the highest, and lastly support.  ""Successful people don't do it alone.  Where they come from matters.  They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell).   By reading this, it made me enjoy the book, and words from Gladwell. I agreed with his theories at all times.  The matters that he had brought up, I had never thought about before.  From this it gave me a new view of success and was encouragement for myself to work for it in my own life.  With the sense of what it takes for an accomplishment, it makes the reader want to learn more of how to do it and that they aren't as far away from it as they might have thought.  For that reason, is why all readers should read this book, because it puts a true meaning on life and where one can lead their own path into the future.",2009-03-24

The first thing I noticed about the book is that Gladwell REALLY did his research here. It began to seem as though the book were more about statistics and reviews rather than his own opinions, however maybe I'm wrong and I was missing the big picture. The extensive amount of quotes baffles me and they all flow nicely. I really liked how Gladwell makes everything into lament's terms no matter how complicated it may be, and then he reviews over what is happening as he makes his stories out of quotes and statistics.

As parents of 2 young children, this book has inspired us to have a different thinking approach to the learning process.  It reminds us of the importance of even seemingly small tasks. For instance, reading books every night and having the kids ""read the book"" back to us is a great experience for them. Even though they can't read yet, they are participating in the process.  I totally agree with his premise regarding education.  We should all get actively involved in our children's lives by providing opportunities to learn.  With the proper guidance, we can teach them to participate and think independently, instead of taking a back seat in life.  I don't care whether my kids are the next Bill Gates or big shot lawyer making a zillion dollars a year.

,5,Success: More than Smarts,"Success: More than Smarts. Malcolm Gladwell's new book, Outliers, has come out at a perfect time when people are looking everywhere to find the key to success. The past few years have brought about many bestsellers telling readers the simple steps to becoming successful. Yet what Gladwell presents in his book is that people's hard work and perseverance isn't only what leads to their success; it's what they have no control over, like culture, heritage, and upbringing, which ultimately provides them with the opportunity to succeed.
	In his novel, Gladwell provides many current day examples of ""outliers"": Bill Gates and the Beatles, and on a smaller scale, hockey players and a little girl from the Bronx. Gladwell dissects their lives, and thoroughly displays how each person was able to become successful from factors besides innate ability and talent. In a sentence, it is more about rising to the occasion when given the opportunity, more than pure smarts and ability, that makes one successful. 
	It is by no fault that Outliers is highly acclaimed. As a writer, Malcolm Gladwell is a very articulate and concise writer: he is able to piece together his thoughts and ideas in a manner that presents his focus in a clear and effective manner. Also, his style of writing allows him to present many modern day examples, which the reader can relate to, to back his thesis, and then reconnects them all to each other in the end. Once you get going, it is almost hard to put down this book; it becomes so intriguing that you'd rather find out Gladwell's next component to success than do anything else. No downsides of this novel even come to mind. Overall, Outliers is a book that anyone and everyone should read to understand what it takes to become successful.
	This has yet to be the first wonderful book that Malcolm Gladwell has written. His first two novels, Blink and The Tipping Point, are just as highly acclaimed and for good reason. Similarly to Outliers, each book is thoroughly supported through research, and each concept presented in the novels is clear and simple to understand. Any of Malcolm's Gladwell's books are a great read, and promises to keep the reader intrigued through its findings.",2009-03-03

This book contains compelling research into why some succeed more than others and you will be astounded at his conclusions.  This is must reading for all those who wish to understand human achievement and how to expand it.

He debunks the myth of the self-made man who succeeds through hard work and determination alone and uncovers the luck that helped these people out along the way.<br /><br />I liked the way the book is presented. Gladwell takes this information, that some people are predestined to suceed because of their circumstances, and interprets it as there are a lot of other people out there who could also be big successes. If Bill Gates achieved so much because of opportunites he had in high school then how many stories like Bill Gates' would we have if all high school students had his opportunities? By not recognizing the hidden factors to success we are failing to realize, as a society, the full potential of many people. <br /><br />Its an interesting idea and definately makes you wonder about your own life.

Still, if this book makes people even a little more aware of unequal advantages it could be helpful in leveling the playing field.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio, read by Gladwell himself.

Gladwell expertly explains how certain people have become successful and what factors affect one's success, while also answering questions like why Asians are good at math. The book includes information from experts and even quotes from the various people discussed in the book, making Outliers all the more credible. Gladwell's writing is fantastic, easy to follow, and makes this book a real page turner. The book has a nice flow to it, each chapter building on the previous one. Gladwell nicely ends Outliers with his own family story about success, which illustrates all of his arguments presented in the book. Freakonomics exposes the ""hidden side of everything,"" but Outliers exposes the ""facts and reasons behind everything.""

Jabeyo,5,Get Insude Outliers!,"Get Insude Outliers!. From Junior Hockey in Canada, to programming with Bill Gates and Paul Allen, to the crew of a passenger jet headed for the side of a mountain, Outliers is a must read for anyone in business.<br /><br />If you want to be successful, Outliers should definitely be on your bookshelf.  The book presents a series of unrelated groups and events with a consistent theme of right place, right time.<br /><br />It is an easy read not filled with statistics and technical jargon.  Yet, the book takes on a life of its' own and flows from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell's ability to research a topic and then present it in a clear, understandable format makes this a great read from cover to cover.  I plan on adding Blink and Tipping Point to my reading list!",2009-02-09

geoschwartz,4,Why are some people successful and others are not?,"Why are some people successful and others are not?. This highly readable books examines the roots of success, and debunks a lot of common misperceptions. The examples are fascinating, particularly the research done on the ""best"" athletes in Canadian hockey.<br /><br />The basic point from this book is that the best are not always the most successful. Generally, people get to be successful at something as a result of circumstances which in several example has to do with the timing of a person's birth.<br /><br />""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.""",2009-01-31

ardmore32,4,Great Food For Thought,"Great Food For Thought. I listened to the audiobook version of Outliers because I'd heard Gladwell read an excerpt from the book during a radio interview and I really appreciated his interpretation of his own material.<br /><br />This book is great ""food for thought"" and simply asks us to consider more profoundly how external influences do indeed play a role--often a major role--when one reaches a level of extreme success. He does a great job of proposing alternate theories for why certain individuals achieve GREAT success as compared to the old tried and true beliefs such as: ""If anyone works hard enough, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and really make something out of themselves"" or ""If you're really smart and rich, you've got it made in this world"". The book prods one to think carefully about educational systems, parenting, and other social systems in our culture.<br /><br />I didn't expect that Gladwell would provide a science-based thesis or definition of ""success"", nor did I expect a ""how-to"" manual. I found the book to be very entertaining and thought-provoking, and in that regard, my expectations were met handily.",2009-01-15

silverhorn,3,Forced,"Forced. I loved ""Blink"" and ""Tipping Point"", but ""Outliers"" fell short of what I expect from Gladwell.  Not only did the book ramble along seemingly without much thought given to organization, but I felt like Gladwell was forcing data to fit his ideas rather than researching with an open mind.  Some of the information was interesting and thought-provoking and some of the book was close to boring.  I found myself having to re-read passages because I had blanked out as I lost interest.  The best part of reading ""Outliers"" is in comparing Gladwell's earlier writings with this effort and realizing one success does not guarantee another.",2009-01-06

Reality-Man,3,Theory,"Theory. OUTLIERS is an interesting book but I don't feel it is especially enlightening or in most cases practical. We have no choice who our parents are, where or when we are born, and much of the material in the book is based on these circumstances.<br /><br />Warren Buffett in his book, THE SNOWBALL, speaks of the Ovarian Lottery  and it is hard to challenge this. It may be that with the information we are given in OUTLINERS, assuming it is factual, that we might want to make some decisions about when our children enter school. Certainly being in the right place at the right time has always been advantageous in life.<br /><br />Children born to good loving parents with positive parenting skills will always have a definite advantage in life no matter where in the world they are born. It doesn't hurt to have a little luck but in most cases luck is the result of preparation. As Gladwell states: ""Luck is winning the lottery"". Though many parents would like to blame others for their children's misgivings all should  feel a responsiblity for our children's successes and failures. <br /><br />Everyone will have many opportunities in life. The key is to be aware of them and take advantage of them as no one knows when the last one will arrive.",2008-12-22
JeffersonLocke,5,Makes You Think,"Makes You Think. Some people will find this book to be very uncomfortable to read, in large part because Gladwell makes a solid case for ""why"" we achieve greatness or failure.  The ""why"", as Gladwell argues, is a complex function of our backgrounds, our environments, our genealogy, and our procilivities to grasp opportunities as they present themselves.  While super success stories (e.g. Bill Gates) are used as models, there are also general cases that don't involve incredible success - success in sports or mathematics are two that Gladwell addresses.<br /><br />The book was most valuable to me for two reasons: First, it has forced me to look at my life and assess where I've been blind to opportunities that have come my way - in doing so, I see where I can improve.  I also see where I've been terribly ungrateful for the great legacy that my parents, grandparents, teachers, etc. have provided for me.  I'm still relatively young - there's time for me to increase my impact for good.  Second, Gladwell has caused me to think about what type of environment and opportunities I'm facilitating for my children AND for others who I love dearly.  If I take greater care of my ""world"" - the sphere in which I can influence - perhaps my impact on the world will be magnified by those who go after me.  After all, success is as much a legacy to pass on as it is the result of rugged individualism and good fortune.  <br /><br />Great read - I highly recommend it, for what my opinion is worth!",2008-12-22

_Mario_,5,A Further Exlanation,"A Further Exlanation. It's true, the primary premise of Gladwell's Outliers is that success is not about what we are told its about.  It¿s also true that this idea isn't anything new.  But if you're on the fence about buying this one, you should consider a few other truths about the work.  <br /><br />The ""successful"" people that Gladwell is referring to in Outliers are not the garden variety ""he's a successful dentist"" types.  An Outlier is not someone who made something of themselves in the sense that they earn above average income, drive high-line cars, and make six or seven figures.  Nor is he referring to wealth alone as a measure of success (J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of his Outliers).  He is talking about real - out there on the edge alone - success.  The Beatles kind of success, Bill Gates kind of success, so take with a grain of salt reviews that bash The book for being unoriginal or for not providing useful information on ""how to"" become successful.  <br /><br />Clarification: Reading Outliers wont help you become an outlier anymore than reading Blink will make you a better thin slicer - but his section on scholastic sports and ""gifted"" classes in grade school may make you hold your kid back a year to dramatically change their lives in a positive way.<br /><br />What this book is useful for is its further explanation and revelation of the true cause of something (extreme success in this case) and a pattern that has developed to explain it that has nothing to do with reality.  Gladwell's research is as solid as ever; interesting as ever; and I recommend the book as worth the purchase price.  I couldn't put it down, I took notes, underlined passages, then read it again; all without a twinge of buyer¿s remorse.",2008-11-29

Hard2Impress,5,Awesome!!!,"Awesome!!!. I have not even finished the book, but I am so captivated that I can hardly put it down. I tell everyone I know what a great book it is because I find it useful on so many levels. It makes me think of both my personal professional growth and my parenting skills, and it gives me ideas for ways to improve upon both of them. <br /><br />I am always impressed by Gladwell's ability to break down what appears to be a simple concept into different equally important layers that I never would have considered. The reasearch is impeccable, and the conclusions make practical, realistic sense. If you are someone who associates and/or works with people of varied socioeconomic backgrounds, the evidence of Gladwell's conclusions are obvious. <br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone. It is AWESOME!!!",2008-11-24

PatSoandSo,5,Ten Thousand Hours vs. Talent,"Ten Thousand Hours vs. Talent. I'm only 3/4 the way through Gladwell's newest, but felt the urge to comment.<br /><br />When I read Gladwell -- and the notion I am about to convey is more true with ""Outliers"" than his other two -- I feel like I am reading some kind of new, accessible, revolutionary philosophy.  <br /><br />I mean, even if he had it wrong about the 10,000 hours' practice, although I do not believe he has gotten it wrong, if we as a people, as communities, as a nation, as a world, gave ourselves and each other -- every man, woman and child on this planet who desired the chance -- the opportunity at their given 10,000 hours, we would have a very excellent planet on which to reside in a generation or two.",2008-11-22

,2,"Interesting Anecdotes, Faulty Reasoning","Interesting Anecdotes, Faulty Reasoning. I tend to like books in the Freakonomics vein, so I enjoyed the anecdotal format and the stories Gladwell relates.  However, I found the conclusions he drew from them to be shallow and unconvincing.  For instance, he discusses the affirmative action policies at the University of Michigan Law School and notes that the less qualified minority students are comparatively as successful as their ""smarter""* counterparts.  He uses this example to support the point that that once you cross a certain IQ threshold then variations in IQ are unimportant, and thus any concerns about these students being at a disadvantage to their ""smarter"" classmates are unfounded.  However, he never considers whether the same biases that allowed the less qualified students into UM carry over into the workplace.  Firms are as eager to hire minority attorneys as law schools are to admit minority students.  To highlight why his reasoning is problematic, consider whether a person analyzing the effects of undergraduate affirmative action policies on their intended beneficiaries (i.e. minority students) would cite statistics regarding graduate school admissions where the same preferences are in play. <br /><br />* Gladwell is using this example to make a point about IQ levels, so I used this word even though I find it inappropriate.  I think here Gladwell falls into the very trap he is supposedly warning against by equating accomplishment with IQ.  No one takes an IQ test before entering law school.  Therefore, the disparity he is referring to between white and black students is in accomplishment (undergraduate grades, LSAT scores, etc.), not IQ.",2008-11-21

,4,Malcolm Gladwell continues to impress,"Malcolm Gladwell continues to impress. I waited a long time for this book to come out -- all summer, in fact.  I had the date circled on my calendar and felt euphoric when I finally had it in my hands.  Gladwell did not disappoint me!  Why?<br /><br />First, of course, there's the intriguing subject matter:  wouldn't we all like to know the formula for success a la Bill Gates?  Second, it's the expert handling of this subject matter.  Malcolm Gladwell always manages to take some pretty heady topics -- like cultural communications and their effects on plane crashes -- and through his masterful handling and style, make them not only understandable but compelling.  Gladwell takes you by the hand and leads you through places like the rice fields of China, schools of South Africa, and riots of Jamaica, and explains step-by-step the relevance and poignancy of seemingly insigificant facts that all add up to one profound truth.  I simply could not put this fascinating book down.  <br /><br />I mentioned the content of this book to my high school students, and they were very interested to hear about how communication styles (assertiveness, entitlement, etc.) could affect their success in college and beyond.  That's something they might not learn implicitly, but is completely teachable. Today, I will be passing this book onto an 11th grader, in hopes that she'll be able to find something she'll dedicate 10,000 hours to.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I want more.  How long until his next book comes out?",2008-11-21
,1,His weakest book yet...,"His weakest book yet.... I like Malcolm Gladwell BUT I think this is his weekest book yet.

If you are not one to think for yourself this maybe the book for you.",2008-11-20
Preston_Barrett,5,An interesting look at what creates success,"An interesting look at what creates success. In this wide-ranging third installment of Malcolm Gladwell's exploration of how people and social phenomena work, the New Yorker journalist takes a close look at what constitutes high levels of success. That is, what makes people at the top of their respective fields get there? As we've come to expect from Gladwell's previous books, the answer to the question is a bit complicated.<br /><br />He says that upbringing, culture and even random luck have something to with success, but there is another important quality that anyone can control. Two chapters are dedicated to the ""revelation"" that IQ is only a baseline quality and success has little to nothing to do with having a high IQ or a low IQ. Rather, success is substantially a product of cultivating a high degree of what Robert Sternberg calls ""practical intelligence"" or what most refer to as ""emotional intelligence.""<br /><br />Gladwell uses the example of Nobel laureates coming from unknown schools as often as ivy league schools. At this level of mastery IQ is no longer a factor. Success has little to do with where you were educated and everything to do with your level of practical/emotional intelligence and willingness to put in the 10,000 hours of practice required to reach mastery of your field.<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting read that isn't too heady and goes by pretty quickly, as the interesting anecdotes are what you would expect from Gladwell.<br /><br />Another book on the topic that I strongly recommend because it has been really helpful to me in actually applying what Gladwell teaches in my own life (for my own success!) is The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book.",2008-11-20

Gladwell explains that opportunities, timing, luck, &amp; cultural legacies all play a chief role determining if a person will be successful or not. He examines the opportunities presented to Bill Joy, Bill Gates etc and shows how the most successful people in the world would not have made it if certain events didn't happen the way they did. There are so many more ppl in the world with the capability of being successful who just don't succeed due to circumstances. The story at points was a bit scattered, but the overall message of success makes it worth it.",2008-10-30
