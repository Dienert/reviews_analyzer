Dhruv Sharma,4,Phenomenal,"Phenomenal. To describe it in one word – Scintillating!

Sameer Saurabh,5,An answer to one of our unending questions,An answer to one of our unending questions. There are certain questions that repeatedly keep coming to our mind...perhaps one of them is what really makes a difference between a successful and unsuccessful person?

I believe it helps in understanding the interconnection between hard work and luck (can be defined here as inborn advantages) and the role that it can play in achieving success.,2017-08
