Spectrum314k,1,Journalism and pseudoscience,"Journalism and pseudoscience. Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",2017-11-12,Reino Unido
Stiven Skyrah,5,Salient and grounded,"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",2018-03-03,Reino Unido
J C Mitchinson,3,Interesting enough but certainly no revelation,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",2014-06-23,Reino Unido
Marty M,5,Fascinating and  thought-provoking,"Fascinating and  thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the  most special of humans have been the  product of  their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the  opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2019-01-17,Reino Unido
bobrayner,3,Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",2020-02-18,Reino Unido
Paul Walsh,5,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings","Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2018-09-01,Reino Unido
GoldenHen,2,Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions,"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2014-08-17,Reino Unido
tallmanbaby,4,one great read,"one great read.

IS,5,Interesting….,"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",2021-12-28,Reino Unido

AM Brody,5,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement. This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,2021-02-10,Reino Unido

Are the born with a skill?  Do you have to learn a skill?  Do you have to be born at the right time?  Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”?  The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time.  Were they the brightest or the best?  As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them.  We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",2019-12-16,Reino Unido
Special,4,Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right,"Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right. I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",2022-03-12,Reino Unido
Steve,4,I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone,"I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone. Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",2017-10-01,Reino Unido
Spoda,5,Wonderful,"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",2019-09-03,Reino Unido
Expatista,4,"Should have been called ""Luck""","Should have been called ""Luck"". My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",2014-12-23,Reino Unido
A. Davies,5,Food for thought,"Food for thought. Outliers is my book of the year so far. I know I'm late to the party, but it really made me think.

It is full of 'A ha"" moments  When I first started reading it I wasn't enthralled but as the author started to show connections and underlying situations that build up to success, I was  really impressed.",2019-03-31,Reino Unido
daud bhatti,5,Not what I expected but a great read!,"Not what I expected but a great read!. I was expecting a self help book on trying to be sucessful. No dont be mislead this is a book not telling you have success in your own control but rather the opposite. Its still a great book, that is written amazingly with some really relevant and interesting examples. The chapter on Bill Gates is a story I have found myself telling others about",2021-04-23,Reino Unido
Laurence,4,Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is,"Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is. This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view.  As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages.  It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",2019-09-17,Reino Unido
Cols,4,A good book,"A good book. A better read than i thought it would be.  I purchased this as the kindle daily deal and thought it might be ok but not that good, but i was wrong.

Álvaro Nieto,5,"I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if ...","I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if .... Although the author Tries to make you look twice at what you thought were life's predestinations, it does so by choosing very precise close space situations and drawing conclusions from them. I would normally say it is dangerous to draw a universal law of things from such a finite number of observations.",2017-11-08,Reino Unido
Mike Brady,5,"Much more than 10,000 hours","Much more than 10,000 hours. I came to this book for it popularising the 10,000 hour theory - some say over-simplifying. I was surprised and then delighted to find that is just one reference in a book drawing together many insightful ideas to unpick the myths of what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field. But as Malcolm Gladwell reveals, there are other factors, many beyond our control, which should keep us humble if successful and tolerant of those who missed out. I look forward to reading his other books.",2021-10-09,Reino Unido

Stephen George,4,Enjoyable read,Enjoyable read. Having read reviews for and against the book I thought I would read it - especially as it was a Kindle special. It's an easy read and although a little repetitive I did enjoy it and do think he makes some good points. In the end it's probably a little too simplistic in its conclusions but that doesn't spoil it as a good book.,2017-07-27,Reino Unido
Stephen Smith,5,Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes,"Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes. This book is full of interesting stuff: From why one rural community in the US had amazing health to how plane crashes happen. It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance.

Akhil B,3,Not as I had thought,Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,2020-05-17,Reino Unido
Bargain Betty,5,Fantastic (but don't read it before a flight),"Fantastic (but don't read it before a flight). The author has that unique skill of being able to view and interpret the World exactly as it is, not tinted by any preconceptions or expectations. His 10,000 hr rule, from my personal experience, is bang on. I found this book was similar in vein to Freakonomics which I also recommend, and Tipping Point has also been on my list for a while so I will definitely be reading that sometime soon.",2015-10-27,Reino Unido

C. Brown-quinn,4,Thinking Differently about Successful People,"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories.

DarraghD,3,Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic,"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",2013-05-28,Reino Unido

Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting.  What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way.

This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'.  It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies.  I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",2020-07-18,Canadá

Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility.

Josh,5,Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us.

C&F LAND RESOURCE,5,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure","Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2015-11-05,Canadá
A. Volk,5,A fascinating look at success,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck.  It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary.  For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced.  Based on your astrological sign!  That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older.  And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference.  That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children.  Is that fair?  No.  It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up.  Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year.  That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2009-11-05,Canadá

This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard.

I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes!

Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind.

Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was  just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works.  Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered.  I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together.  Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line.

Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book.  On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!!

The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability.  That being said, the book gave me hope.  It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone.  Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring"").  Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose.  We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection.  Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening.  As I said, I've not yet completed the book.

Tony R.,5,The Insights of Outliers,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2018-09-26,Estados Unidos

Jennifer P,3,meh,"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards.

There were a couple of silly mistakes, like the ""220 000 kgs of STEEL slamming into the rocky ground"" whereby aluminum makes up 81% of the subject aircraft's primary structure (Boeing 747). I can relate to the struggle to rise up in social rank.

Immer,5,The Hidden Advantages in Life and Culture,"The Hidden Advantages in Life and Culture. Malcom Gladwell’s Outliers is a fascinating book. It synthesizes the coincidental pathways that lead to greatness rather than common place, and does so on the individual level  all the way to the national and cultural levels with resulting ramifications. His thesis is not that everybody is bound for greatness, but more greatness could be achieved if the playing fields of education, sports, and culture could be leveled. This does not mean taking access away from achievers, but developing the means for equal access to pathways of greatness for more children/people.",2018-03-05,Estados Unidos

David,5,Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!,"Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!. “Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point.  Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it. If you’re willing to really analyze the content, it could definitely leave an impact on your life. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious and enjoys reading material that challenges them to think critically.",2017-09-28,Estados Unidos
Todeco,3,An ok book,"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring?

For example, if you wanted to be part of the computer revolution, 1955 USA was the best time and place to be born. All the major founders of Apple and  Microsoft were born between 1953-1957 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both born perfectly in 1955.

Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone.  In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there.

Malcolm Gladwell here adds to the materiality of success as a phenomenon that is essentially not abnormal or irrational—the oddity of success can be historically explained if we keenly study the opportunities made available to a seeming outlier. Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out. Gladwell’s seeming unwillingness to do the academic dance expected of scholars is refreshing: He’s a popular cultural critic who seems to want to make academic inquiry and discovery a layman pursuit.,2018-09-09,Estados Unidos

josh casillas,3,Easy read; not many actionable takeaways,"Easy read; not many actionable takeaways. I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",2019-06-27,Estados Unidos
James Kwon Lee,3,Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",2015-02-10,Estados Unidos
madhavi bommakanti,5,Very Good Buy!,"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them.

Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C.

We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",2013-09-22,Estados Unidos

Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting).

Mikio Miyaki,5,Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.,"Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.. Outliers is a book about successors. Malcolm Gladwell analyzes success follows a predictable course. Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",2014-11-07,Estados Unidos

sdone,5,We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?,"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",2013-11-22,Estados Unidos

On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens.

Gary,5,Gladwell's Best Book,Gladwell's Best Book. Probably Gladwell's most entertaining book. We all love a good success story. A story about cases where people go from nothing to overwhelming and legendary status. This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are. The conditions that were out of their control that they luckily fell into. You also learn of the extraordinary amount of work they also had to put in. A great read. Gladwell's best book if you ask me.,2015-11-01,Estados Unidos

Debra K. Bonafede,5,Not the Whole Story But a Great Start,"Not the Whole Story But a Great Start. As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too.  The one thing I feel that I struggle against  daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year  chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.",2013-07-14,Estados Unidos

The author is great and is an excellent writer.  I will read more books from this author.  The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great.  All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart.  I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something.  However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed.  It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time.  What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else?

No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman.  The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise.  As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read.

His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule)  and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",2010-01-28,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",2010-08-04,Estados Unidos

Mitchell Vega,5,A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere,"A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere. It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. ""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.",2012-12-20,Estados Unidos

It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported.  The book's central ideas are 1) that brain power, character, and motivation are overrated; 2) other factors—often not easily recognized or not given enough significance—such as where and when a person was born, his or her family history, and the particular twists of fate and coincidences in a life story, are integral to the success (or failure) of an individual.",2014-06-09,Estados Unidos

Advantages they inherently had.  He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying.  He picks great examples and this really helps the book.

Molly,4,His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative,"His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative. Gladwell's writing is capable both of being utterly convincing (the phrase ""selling ice to an Eskimo"" comes to mind) and of taking a simple truth readers already know (that success comes from our own very specific, cultural circumstances - in addition to hard work) and making it seem as though it is shockingly novel and groundbreaking (his thesis focuses on trends of success that are counter to, or sometimes not even considered in, our expectations).",2016-01-20,Estados Unidos

After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",2009-05-22,Estados Unidos

I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one.  I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered.  Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception.  I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe.  I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to  ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later.

Robert Abell,4,Outliers Are Not Really Outliers,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed.  The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair.  Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November.  It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year.  Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children.  They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year.  However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year.  As the school years pass, the gap widens.  A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform.  Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",2011-01-25,Estados Unidos

No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders.  Its all about the parents.  We are the creators of our own children's destiny.  And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG!  its us.  No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it?  its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are.

Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan).  There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.

Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck.  I agreed with everything in the book.  It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.  Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against.  That is unfair.

It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work.

But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled?  We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person.  How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives?  Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success?  Do we really have a handle on that?

It was a good read,  but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case.

Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.",2009-05-19,Estados Unidos
Rudolph M Ten-Pow,4,Not talent alone,"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",2009-01-11,Estados Unidos

This book shows how past a certain point, IQ doesn't matter in your overall success.  I also know that because the cut-off date of my birthday, my parents chose to wait to start me in first grade until I was almost a year older than the other kids.  Consequently, I was always ahead of the curve academically because of my age.  I know other people whose parents chose to start them a little earlier in school, and they never catch up academically.

The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal.

But they don’t.  They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy.  Their success is not exceptional or mysterious.  It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are.  The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.” which I find extremely powerful.

In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion.

Steve,5,Wonderful Book!,"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",2017-09-25,Estados Unidos
Charles M. Davis,4,Fascinating look at what makes people successful...,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful....

I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York).  Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds.  Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct.  Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis.  A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",2014-01-14,Estados Unidos

The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating.  The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief.

In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme.  In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",2009-05-01,Estados Unidos

S. Maughan,3,**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer.  You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories.  But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""?  The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point.  Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past.  You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"".  Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech.  And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous.  Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success.  Surely the successful need to ""share their success"".  Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals).  This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",2013-02-28,Estados Unidos

I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read.  Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of ""pop-science"" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book.  I must say that I never found myself wishing for more substance, I thought this was a good book, it brings to light many interesting ideas and thoughts.

Gail Dohrmann,1,hypothesis contrary to fact,"hypothesis contrary to fact. The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in  the roots or causes of success.  Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact.""  Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing.  According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot.

For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things.

Dextra L. Suggs,5,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation""","""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",2009-07-12,Estados Unidos

Wanda B. Red,4,Not itself an outlier,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",2011-07-24,Estados Unidos

Brad Gustave,2,Overrated,"Overrated. I feel like Gladwell presents an intriguing question, but he offers no control cases, except for the case of Mr. Langan. As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful. Tepid work at best.",2013-12-15,Estados Unidos

Gerry,4,"Thought provoking, yet easy to read","Thought provoking, yet easy to read. Having read his previous 2 books I pretty much knew what to expect from this one with respect to writing style.  Gladwell's books are well written, very easy to read, and short.  He lays out his thesis through a series of anecdotes, almost a set of magazine articles, which labor the point a little too long.  Each anecdote is supported by data, but not to the point of overwhelming the reader, and certainly not ""comprehensive"" data on the topic.",2009-01-26,Estados Unidos

Psych Doc,5,A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention,"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening.  I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging.  He was right.  Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance.  In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary.  Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts.  Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control.  These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",2011-09-05,Estados Unidos

Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field.

No body achieve success without help from someone else -even if this help is minimal, a statement that other books on personal education and advancement also support, like ""Never Eat Alone"" by Keith Ferrazzi.

Some, of course, work better than others.

It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked.

Qdaddy,5,Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",2012-02-22,Estados Unidos
Ben Barron,5,One of Best,"One of Best.

However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it.

For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line.

There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited.

Amol Nirgudkar,5,Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration,"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness.  In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world.  Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement.  Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",2012-03-23,Estados Unidos

TheMattstermind,5,IQ does not define success,"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2012-08-04,Estados Unidos

Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",2009-05-26,Estados Unidos

This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down.

I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there.  The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention.  This book is not only educational but also entertaining.

Amazon Customer,5,Parent or Not to Parent,"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself.  In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial  with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount.  One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself.  Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately.  I agree with the premise of the book to a point.  While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors.  By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",2017-01-13,Estados Unidos

The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened.  He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,2013-05-20,Estados Unidos

This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress.  Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book.  Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.)  There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground.

Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion.

V. Vital,5,Enjoyable and enlightening,"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is well written and very thought provoking.  Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society.  Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion.  My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success.  The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook.  Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely.  This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions).  Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W.

The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak.  I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents.  When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling.

He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential.  He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate.  He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking.

The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting.  Convincing, great food for thought.  The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time.  I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages.  (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.)  For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research.  This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education.

The examples he gives are fascinating and I fond quite a bit too highlight.

In my opinion, all of the teenagers should read this book. In one book Malcolm Gladwell put the years of life experiences of very successful people in this country and abroad. He showed how important to work your 10.000 hours in order to really accomplish anything you love, were dreaming about all of your childhood. You can be born a genius, but you'd accomplish nothing, if you won't work hard, but if you are working hard and long hours, the success would come to you.

The real point is, it's inspiring.  Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity.  Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable.  I think it's a good estimate of the truth.  I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.

Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter.  We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit.

Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful.  Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point.  He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality.  The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",2009-09-27,Estados Unidos

And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes.

Linda,5,Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review,"Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review. The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this.  I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage,  to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific. Gladwell was intriguing by the way he described his mom and ancestors at the end especially the tenacity of his grandmother gets her daughter (his mom) into school! Five stars!!",2017-03-08,Estados Unidos

The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation.  If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too.  This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you.  It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.

Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses.  But this book was different.  Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times.  It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help.  Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family.  I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had.  It was all there.  The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.

Shannon J Bockstahler,4,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but...","Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",2011-04-21,Estados Unidos

Mei,5,Outliers -Bliss,"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",2010-06-21,Estados Unidos

Shelley C.,5,Required Book Review for ENTR 300,"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule.  Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected.  You can also see the influences of his family in his life.  His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician.  Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha).  Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success.  Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",2015-03-08,Estados Unidos

Why this book matters:  I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers.  When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell.  Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience.  Many books are a great read.  How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come?  To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance.

Sampah,1,Unconvincing and overly long.,"Unconvincing and overly long.. I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",2010-04-29,Estados Unidos

The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly.  Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me.

The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader.

J C Mitchinson,3,Interesting enough but certainly no revelation,"Interesting enough but certainly no revelation. Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",2014-06-23,Reino Unido
Marty M,5,Fascinating and  thought-provoking,"Fascinating and  thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the  most special of humans have been the  product of  their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the  opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",2019-01-17,Reino Unido
bobrayner,3,Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy,"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",2020-02-18,Reino Unido
Paul Walsh,5,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings","Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings. Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",2018-09-01,Reino Unido
GoldenHen,2,Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions,"Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions. To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",2014-08-17,Reino Unido

As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",2017-10-01,Reino Unido

My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style.

The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field.

I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful.

This is statistically interesting, on how a simple rule can create a disparity that never goes away, and how some people just fall by luck into a benefit. But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'.  It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies.  I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better. Not even good conversation starters.",2020-07-18,Canadá

Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility.

Josh,5,Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.,"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us.

C&F LAND RESOURCE,5,"Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure","Want to be successful - spend 10,000 hours practicing or be prepared for failure. A masterful analysis of the critical factors which determine individual success in almost any field or endeavor. Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",2015-11-05,Canadá
A. Volk,5,A fascinating look at success,"A fascinating look at success. Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck.  It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary.  For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced.  Based on your astrological sign!  That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older.  And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference.  That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children.  Is that fair?  No.  It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up.  Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year.  That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",2009-11-05,Canadá

One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret.

This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard.

Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind.

Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was  just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works.  Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered.  I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together.  Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line.

Overall, I liked this book - its a very interesting read for sure, however, it seems very simplified at points to the extent that you might as well say success depends on whether the Universe is with you or against you. That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book.  On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!!

The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability.  That being said, the book gave me hope.  It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone.  Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring"").  Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose.  We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection.  Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening.  As I said, I've not yet completed the book.

Tony R.,5,The Insights of Outliers,"The Insights of Outliers. There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",2018-09-26,Estados Unidos

Jennifer P,3,meh,"meh. 3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards.

His thesis is not that everybody is bound for greatness, but more greatness could be achieved if the playing fields of education, sports, and culture could be leveled. This does not mean taking access away from achievers, but developing the means for equal access to pathways of greatness for more children/people.",2018-03-05,Estados Unidos

In other words (Spoiler Alert) there are no outliers.",2021-07-08,Estados Unidos
David,5,Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!,"Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!. “Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point.  Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it. If you’re willing to really analyze the content, it could definitely leave an impact on your life. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious and enjoys reading material that challenges them to think critically.",2017-09-28,Estados Unidos
Todeco,3,An ok book,"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",2021-01-10,Estados Unidos

This in itself will come as no surprise but the author succeeds in making a science of it. For example, if you wanted to be part of the computer revolution, 1955 USA was the best time and place to be born. All the major founders of Apple and  Microsoft were born between 1953-1957 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both born perfectly in 1955.

He divides the book into groups of factually similar individual stories that, in turn, cluster around a common theme.  Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone.  In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there.

While he never dismisses the factors of effort, talent and hard work, he does put these in perspective and the context of unique opportunity.

edgar munoz,5,Outliers are less mythic than we think in the end,Outliers are less mythic than we think in the end. Always historicize is a dictum espoused by Fredric Jameson and other cultural critics when it comes to understanding phenomena. Malcolm Gladwell here adds to the materiality of success as a phenomenon that is essentially not abnormal or irrational—the oddity of success can be historically explained if we keenly study the opportunities made available to a seeming outlier. Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out. Gladwell’s seeming unwillingness to do the academic dance expected of scholars is refreshing: He’s a popular cultural critic who seems to want to make academic inquiry and discovery a layman pursuit.,2018-09-09,Estados Unidos

josh casillas,3,Easy read; not many actionable takeaways,"Easy read; not many actionable takeaways. I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",2019-06-27,Estados Unidos
James Kwon Lee,3,Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments,"Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments. I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",2015-02-10,Estados Unidos
madhavi bommakanti,5,Very Good Buy!,"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them.

The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5.

Start from the top left corner of the puzzle and notice the heart shapes, they all exist in three vertical lines. Then, to its right and to its down, notice the diamond shapes in those two pictures, they too are placed in all three vertical lines, and the rest merely has two. Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C.

We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.

It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",2013-09-22,Estados Unidos

Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting).

Mikio Miyaki,5,Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.,"Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.. Outliers is a book about successors. Malcolm Gladwell analyzes success follows a predictable course. Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",2014-11-07,Estados Unidos

sdone,5,We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?,"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",2013-11-22,Estados Unidos

On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens.

Gary,5,Gladwell's Best Book,Gladwell's Best Book. Probably Gladwell's most entertaining book. We all love a good success story. A story about cases where people go from nothing to overwhelming and legendary status. This book takes apart those stories and explodes the myths and lies we attach to them. It also provides a more realistic context for understanding those stories. So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like. But you also learn things about those stories that put their lives into a context you can understand. You realize the luck they had to get where they are. The conditions that were out of their control that they luckily fell into. You also learn of the extraordinary amount of work they also had to put in. A great read. Gladwell's best book if you ask me.,2015-11-01,Estados Unidos

Debra K. Bonafede,5,Not the Whole Story But a Great Start,"Not the Whole Story But a Great Start. As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too.  The one thing I feel that I struggle against  daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year  chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.",2013-07-14,Estados Unidos

The part Mr. Gladwell doesn't really discuss is the spiritual component of the stories he brings up in the book though. At the beginning he mentions this Italian town that moved to America and their great success. He mentions their faith as a key component to their success in this introduction story, but never brings it up again. Without this developed piece the book feels like it is missing something.

Franklin,4,Interesting Stories and Ideas,"Interesting Stories and Ideas. Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas.  Not sure I agree with it all.  The author is great and is an excellent writer.  I will read more books from this author.  The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great.  All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart.  I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something.  However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed.  It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time.  What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books.  A very enjoyable read!",2014-05-31,Estados Unidos
Chris,5,Homework...,"Homework.... This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman.  The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise.  As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read.

His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule)  and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",2010-01-28,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",2010-08-04,Estados Unidos

Mitchell Vega,5,A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere,"A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere. It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. ""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.",2012-12-20,Estados Unidos

Betsy L. Adams,5,It is easy to see why The Outliers,"It is easy to see why The Outliers. It is easy to see why The Outliers, The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell was the number one national best seller. This book includes remarkable stories that I found fascinating and inspiring. This book is about many different people and stories from different walks of life and how they were able to find success.

Greg,4,"Great Book with great views, lost me as it went on","Great Book with great views, lost me as it went on. Gladwell does a great job of showing you ""the other side of the coin,"" when it comes to success.  Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over.  Advantages they inherently had.  He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying.  He picks great examples and this really helps the book.  The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)",2011-09-17,Estados Unidos

Molly,4,His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative,"His writing is easily digestible while still highly informative. Gladwell's writing is capable both of being utterly convincing (the phrase ""selling ice to an Eskimo"" comes to mind) and of taking a simple truth readers already know (that success comes from our own very specific, cultural circumstances - in addition to hard work) and making it seem as though it is shockingly novel and groundbreaking (his thesis focuses on trends of success that are counter to, or sometimes not even considered in, our expectations).",2016-01-20,Estados Unidos

After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the ""right"" year).",2009-05-22,Estados Unidos

I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one.  I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered.  Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception.  I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe.  I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to  ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later.

Robert Abell,4,Outliers Are Not Really Outliers,"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed.  The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair.  Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November.  It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year.  Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children.  They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year.  However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year.  As the school years pass, the gap widens.  A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform.  Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",2011-01-25,Estados Unidos

No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders.  Its all about the parents.  We are the creators of our own children's destiny.  And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG!  its us.  No, this is not a book on child rearing...or is it?  its a scientific no-bull***t fact-based study on why we are what we are.

Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan).  There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.

Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck.  I agreed with everything in the book.  It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.  Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against.  That is unfair.

This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work.

But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled?  We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person.  How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives?  Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success?  Do we really have a handle on that?

It's a fascinating study of some of the real underlying elements of success: it doesn't really come ""out of the blue"".  Gladwell points to chance opportunities that successful people have taken advantage of, and how those opportunities aided the progress of the person under discussion.",2009-05-19,Estados Unidos
Rudolph M Ten-Pow,4,Not talent alone,"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",2009-01-11,Estados Unidos

This book shows how past a certain point, IQ doesn't matter in your overall success.  I also know that because the cut-off date of my birthday, my parents chose to wait to start me in first grade until I was almost a year older than the other kids.  Consequently, I was always ahead of the curve academically because of my age.  I know other people whose parents chose to start them a little earlier in school, and they never catch up academically.

That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal.

But they don’t.  They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy.  Their success is not exceptional or mysterious.  It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are.  The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.” which I find extremely powerful.

In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion.

Steve,5,Wonderful Book!,"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",2017-09-25,Estados Unidos
Charles M. Davis,4,Fascinating look at what makes people successful...,"Fascinating look at what makes people successful....

I feel, however, that he chose very specific fields which support his theses (boom of industrial tycoons with Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.; software titans with Gates, Jobs, etc.; and Jewish lawyers in New York).  Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds.  Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct.  Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis.  A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",2014-01-14,Estados Unidos

Others may not be hidden but their cause and effect mechanisms are not fully understood until a unique perspective finally comes along and combines common sense with the multiple streams of psychology, history, culture and mathematics flowing in the background.

There are almost no citations, so you are to take the author at his word.  There are definitely some very interesting parts.  The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating.  The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief.

In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme.  In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",2009-05-01,Estados Unidos

S. Maughan,3,**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!,"**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!. Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer.  You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories.  But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""?  The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point.  Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past.  You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"".  Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech.  And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous.  Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success.  Surely the successful need to ""share their success"".  Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals).  This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.",2013-02-28,Estados Unidos

Benjamin N. Earley,5,Great Read....,"Great Read..... This was my first time reading a Malcolm Gladwell book.  I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and had planned on reading it on vacation.

I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read.  Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of ""pop-science"" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book.  I must say that I never found myself wishing for more substance, I thought this was a good book, it brings to light many interesting ideas and thoughts.

Gail Dohrmann,1,hypothesis contrary to fact,"hypothesis contrary to fact. The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in  the roots or causes of success.  Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact.""  Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing.  According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot.

For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things.

Dextra L. Suggs,5,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation""","""Achievement is talent plus preparation"". As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",2009-07-12,Estados Unidos

Wanda B. Red,4,Not itself an outlier,"Not itself an outlier. ""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",2011-07-24,Estados Unidos

Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful.

Gerry,4,"Thought provoking, yet easy to read","Thought provoking, yet easy to read. Having read his previous 2 books I pretty much knew what to expect from this one with respect to writing style.  Gladwell's books are well written, very easy to read, and short.  He lays out his thesis through a series of anecdotes, almost a set of magazine articles, which labor the point a little too long.  Each anecdote is supported by data, but not to the point of overwhelming the reader, and certainly not ""comprehensive"" data on the topic.",2009-01-26,Estados Unidos

Psych Doc,5,A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention,"A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention. This book is both well-written and eye opening.  I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging.  He was right.  Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance.  In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary.  Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts.  Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control.  These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",2011-09-05,Estados Unidos

Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field.

Everything from why this one is successful and that one is not; why Southerners have a specific type of honor code which is often maladaptive; what leads to Asian superiority in mathematics, and so forth. I can always pick it up to reread it and find something I have missed. I have it in hardback and audio.",2013-06-22,Estados Unidos
Joel D. Worthington,4,Highly Recommend,"Highly Recommend. Outliers was very informative and eye-opening. Gladwell certainly did his research. While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me? What steps do I need to take to replicate the ingredients for success? The answers to these questions go mainly unanswered. With that being said, I highly recommend the book! It is excellent information and with a little work I think we can come up with some great applications to propel ourselves toward greatness!",2014-05-19,Estados Unidos

The problem is that many parents are so abuzz with these patterns that they are attempting to make successes out of their children. (Darn shame happiness doesn't get factored in) Gladwell does not present statistics or examples of outliers of his formulas, of which I'm certain there are many. So this is an interesting but simplistic presentation. It is enjoyable reading. But as you read, consider the outliers of his formulas!",2013-02-01,Estados Unidos
Thomas Philbeck,4,Good thought provocation,"Good thought provocation. Gladwell's strength is in his ability to get others to think about the issue and to communicate to a mass audience. The book is quite enjoyable to read. From a critical standpoint, he isn't providing real evidence for substantiating his insights (you get the ""best of all possible worlds"" feeling quite often in terms of his logic), but rather general patterns that he feels should be noticed. Some, of course, work better than others.  Overall, I think the main insight, that people don't ""go it alone"" but have help from families, generational advantages, or systemic social biases and institutional frameworks, is something that deserves greater reflection by the general public.",2014-01-07,Estados Unidos
Anthony,4,Good book that makes you think different,"Good book that makes you think different. I really enjoyed this book by Gladwell.

However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.",2013-10-27,Estados Unidos

Outliers is more observation than advice; as it should be, considering the case it's making. It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked. Similar to Tipping Point and Blink, Gladwell offers memorable anecdotes - himself obviously a student of his own ""sticky"" storytelling as defined in Tipping Point - packaging complex subject matter in distilled, memorable format for those of us making a living on something other than University Stipend.",2010-06-05,Estados Unidos

Qdaddy,5,Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",2012-02-22,Estados Unidos
Ben Barron,5,One of Best,"One of Best. I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",2010-05-25,Estados Unidos

BEEJ,5,Outliers by Gladwell,"Outliers by Gladwell. This book sparked a very interesting discussion with a book group about the concept of an outlier.  While Gladwell's information was interesting, it seemed to most of us to represent fairly common sense.  However, the group spent about 2 hours discussing the definition of an outlier and thinking of any we thought we might have known once we sort of defined it.  Gladwell's book seemed narrow with respect to being almost exclusively American in nature and ignored so many that were in other places in the world and other times in history.",2009-05-19,Estados Unidos

Amazon Customer,4,Highly recommended,Highly recommended. I very much enjoyed this book.  For the first part of the book I am familiar with the story of Bill Gates and Bill Joy and like millions of others we know the same story line.  This book however brought home to me how much other unique (unique to them and their time) factors contributed greatly to their success.

Having read all of Gladwell's popular titles I see the continuation of his endless quest for the answer to ""why"". The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited.

Amol Nirgudkar,5,Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration,"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness.  In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world.  Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement.  Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",2012-03-23,Estados Unidos

TheMattstermind,5,IQ does not define success,"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",2012-08-04,Estados Unidos

In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary.

Elliott Ingersoll,2,Speaking of outliers...,"Speaking of outliers.... What is it about Malcolm Gladwell's little 8.5""x5.5"" books that I find so annoying? Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",2009-05-26,Estados Unidos

This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down.

I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there.  The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention.  This book is not only educational but also entertaining.

Amazon Customer,5,Parent or Not to Parent,"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself.  In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial  with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount.  One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself.  Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately.  I agree with the premise of the book to a point.  While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors.  By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",2017-01-13,Estados Unidos

The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened.  He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,2013-05-20,Estados Unidos

This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress.  Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book.  Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.)  There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground.

Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion.

V. Vital,5,Enjoyable and enlightening,"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is well written and very thought provoking.  Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society.  Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion.  My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success.  The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook.  Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely.  This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions).  Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W.

The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak.  I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents.  When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling.

He does not understand the role that a culture plays in the development of any person, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" culture, it is what a child gets from his/her environment that helps develop the potential.  He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate.  He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking.

This book was required reading for my high schooler this past Summer Break (but I got to it first).  Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here.  The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting.  Convincing, great food for thought.  The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time.  I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages.  (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.)  For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research.  This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education.

It takes more than intellect and dilligence to get to the top.  Gladwell uses interesting case histories to illustrate factors we seldom think about as leading persons to become exceptionally successful. His research is interesting, almost exciting.  It may even get you to think about why you are as you are, although that is probably not his objective.

It's not fair to say his information is unsupported, he does cite plenty of research to support his theories.  Anyone can be a cynic and claim that he is biased or that he is fake and catchy.  The real point is, it's inspiring.  Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity.  Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable.  I think it's a good estimate of the truth.  I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.

Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter.  We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit.  Although the concept presented by this book is not new, the detailed analysis conducted by Gladwell provided a thought-provoking insight.  I highly recommend this book!",2008-12-12,Estados Unidos

Stephen Witmer,4,Interesting and entertaining read,"Interesting and entertaining read. Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful.  Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point.  He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality.  The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",2009-09-27,Estados Unidos

And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes.

Linda,5,Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review,"Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review. The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this.  I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage,  to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific. Gladwell was intriguing by the way he described his mom and ancestors at the end especially the tenacity of his grandmother gets her daughter (his mom) into school! Five stars!!",2017-03-08,Estados Unidos

Harry Escobar,5,Outliers,"Outliers. This was a fascinating read.  Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me.  The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation.  If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too.  This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you.  It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.  Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.",2009-05-13,Estados Unidos

Every parent and teacher should read ""Outliers"" for insight into what goes into success and how little things can help or hinder all of us.

These aren't just stories of success: the careful reader will find his own pathway to success.  Gladwell doesn't promise as much.  His publisher probably won't let him.

I thought ""wow this is an amazing insight!"" However, after a quick check of the birth dates for the players I found Malcolm's conclusion to be bunk. Contrary to the book, there is an almost even distribution of birth months for the team members I checked multiple years and countries of origin just to be sure that I hadn't discovered another ""Outlier"". After this discovery,I have to call into question all that I have read from him. Maybe the book should be renamed to ""Outliars!""",2013-05-30,Estados Unidos

Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses.  But this book was different.  Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times.  It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help.  Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family.  I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had.  It was all there.  The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.

Shannon J Bockstahler,4,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but...","Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",2011-04-21,Estados Unidos

Mei,5,Outliers -Bliss,"Outliers -Bliss. In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",2010-06-21,Estados Unidos

Shelley C.,5,Required Book Review for ENTR 300,"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule.  Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected.  You can also see the influences of his family in his life.  His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician.  Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha).  Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success.  Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",2015-03-08,Estados Unidos

Why this book matters:  I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers.  When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell.  Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience.  Many books are a great read.  How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come?  To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance.

Sampah,1,Unconvincing and overly long.,"Unconvincing and overly long.. I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",2010-04-29,Estados Unidos

The concept that it is a surprise that ""self-made"" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly.  Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me.  The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).",2009-01-04,Estados Unidos

Andrea Lucas,4,a call to action and recognition of what factors mark the success of great individuals. Gladwell,"a call to action and recognition of what factors mark the success of great individuals. Gladwell. In the novel, Outliers: A Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell tells various stories of success, that in a way, is manifestation, a call to action and recognition of what factors mark the success of great individuals. Gladwell, shows his findings and theory of what he thinks actually constitutes the success of greats like Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and others from a lens that though might seem obvious is many times ignored due to the common notion and praise we give to achieving things from individual merit. With the use of his title, “Outliers,” he provides an outline, or better yet a lens, into what makes outliers—outstanding individuals, or something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body—successful in the end. What many used to and still can argue is due to true talent and hard work, may be caused by a random array of circumstances that if taken advantage of are the true propeller towards success.",2015-05-06,Estados Unidos

brother tim,5,developing a new worldview,"developing a new worldview. gladwell destroys the concept of inherent abilities. as a black man this is important because we have been told for 400 years that we are genetically inferior in intelligence. Gladwell's study indicates that the intelligence factor plays far less a role than many other factors such as time spent on a skill, education, and one's cultural environment. his work is going to have a tremendous effect on the education of children. it will also lead many parents to place more emphasis on intervening in their children's development, especially in having them learn special skills at an early age. we know that tiger woods began playing golf as a toddler. parents will begin taking this concept more seriously than before. black parents will also begin to understand the relationship of culture to their worldview and resultant behavior, especially what they are teaching their children on a subliminal level. it is very critical reading for those of us who live in the black communities of america. this book will spawn tremendous activity and research.many more books will be written because of it.",2010-03-10,Estados Unidos

Parrish Moss,5,For Entrepreneurs,"For Entrepreneurs. I’m a student at University of Baltimore and I am in enrolled in an Entrepreneurship course.  To summarize the book, Outliers takes you through a serious of account and stories to explain how successful people become successful. The first part of the book explains that successful people are successful because of the opportunities they are granted. This allows them to be able to hone their craft, or depending on the era they were born, gives them a chance to capitalize in certain situations. The second part of the book talks about legacy and how depending on your culture, shapes the person you’ll become. What I love about this book, is how it explains how to become successful through the use of inspiring accounts from the lives of people who just like me had or have an ordinary life. In most cases, it’s hard to explain and gives steps on how to be successful because many believe it’s based on luck. However, Gladwell proves that success is almost calculated and mapped out based on the time of several attributes such as your cultural background or opportunities. However, some of his accounts like basing the hockey player’s age as the reason as to why most are successful is farfetched in my opinion. For entrepreneur students, it teaches them to dismiss the fact that being successful is just luck or a random occurrence. Entrepreneur students reading this book learn that success is all based on how you position yourself and the opportunities you decide to take.",2015-03-04,Estados Unidos

Malcolm Gladwell has a unique way of explaining that which, upon reflection, should be common sense. His no-nonsense approach to explaining his observations and views on what constitutes success are presented in a non-pretentious and matter-of-fact manner, but the result leaves the reader reviewing and considering what he's just read. Thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking.",2013-09-24,Estados Unidos

Reeper,1,The Myth of Productivity,"The Myth of Productivity. Gladwell points out some very important factors to increase productivity as a laborer and to be more competitive in an economy that favors employers: Education, Hard Work, Funding, Connections and a little luck.  These are especially important in a declining economy, but their importance is attenuated in a growing economy. As demand for laborers exceeds the labor supply, opportunity is created for everyone, not just the most productive and competitive.  This is the fundamental point that Gladwell does not understand.  He never asks the important questions:  What is causing the demand for labor to decrease?  What is causing a reduction in the supply of jobs?  What is causing economic decline? Why don't we change what is causing demand for labor to decrease instead of increasing the labor supply?  And this is my ""genuine misgiving"" with Gladwell's ""glorious misconception."" Still, the reality is that the economy is in decline and laborers will have to become more competitive in order to gain the diminishing number of jobs available in the market. I think Gladwell does a good job providing psycho-analytical reasons for accepting and persisting in the grind of life as it becomes more grueling and for accepting failure as the result of bad luck. More capital consumption in order to grow and make more competitive the labor supply is not a long term solution.  Increasing the labor pool does not equate to increasing the job pool.  It is not opportunity in real terms.",2013-07-16,Estados Unidos

Yes, Gladwell does say that his ""outliers"" like Bill Gates and Bill Joy had extraordinary opportunities and luck that other people didn't have; but none of that opportunity and luck would have done them any good if they hadn't been willing to work very long hours at programming, in order to become the best programmers in the world.

There are people that can learn a new language (Lithuanian) in a couple of weeks (not 10,000 hours - Think Daniel Tammet). What annoys me is that some people now quote that FALSE STATEMENT as though it were gospel. It's NOT! Oh well, there are also other major errors in Gladwells books, but he IS entertaining.

Neodoering,5,"Yes, Society is Screwing You; Find Out Just How Bad It Is","Yes, Society is Screwing You; Find Out Just How Bad It Is. This was an utterly fascinating book about the secret factors that contribute to individual success.  We are told to be smart, savvy and take advantage of opportunities, but factors like what time of year you're born, what decade you're born in, the circumstances of your education, and other factors beyond our control have a great deal to do with how successful we can become.  This will amaze you, and if you're thinking about it, you'll get mad at how your circumstances determine who you can become.  After a certain point you'll read this book for pointers on how to screw the system that is screwing you.  The discouraging thing is that virtually no one makes it who has not worked hard and done their homework, but most people will be stopped hard by factors they can do nothing about.  I have read several Malcolm Gladwell books and have been consistently pleased by the numerous examples and behind-the-scenes exposes that he consistently highlights.  You have long suspected that society is a rigged game, but the extent to which society is jerking you around must be seen to be believed.

Malcolm Gladwell is a master storyteller who weaves an astonishing tapestry from case examples in sports, technology, manufacturing, education, and other arenas to support his premise. Outliers is fascinating as a sociological map of those we might consider geniuses, but we learn that the true geniuses may be still on the farm, because their circumstances never provided the fertile soil of life situations to propel them to their full potential. Likewise, there are those whose heritage interfered and set the stage for tragedy. Most striking is that you only need to be smart enough, not a genius, to excel.

I ordered this CD set with high hopes after reading all the good reviews.

It is boring, tedious, explains nothing, and gives you an overabundance of details in fields that you probably have no interest in.  The main thing is that the author never quite explains the meaning, reason or route to success.  The author give you the feeling that there is no rhyme or reason for anything, that it is all chance.

M. Hilton,1,Gladwell is over-rated,"Gladwell is over-rated. After reading all three of Gladwell's books (Tipping Point, Blink, and Outlier), I have pretty much figured out his formula.  Glackwell is half black as well as a Canadian.  Basically, he writes about things that would normally be politically incorrect for a white person to write about.  For example, according to Gladwell, Asians are good at math because they come from a culture of growing rice.  He does this from behind the ""shield"" of being half black, so of course he can't possibly be implying anything racist or ethnocentric.  In addition, Gladwell has a very obvious ideology that he is espousing - essentially that of a political liberal who believes that the individual is less important than the culture he comes from or the lucky advantages the individual enjoys.  In other words, the important thing is the collective.",2009-01-12,Estados Unidos
Andrew S. Cofrin,4,What It Takes To Make It,"What It Takes To Make It. Outliers is a sociological study which brings sense to a confusing world. We've always been told, often with ""up from the bootstraps"" Alger allegories, that it takes hard work, smarts, and determination to be a success. However, things like family background and socio-economic status really do matter. Even plain old luck, such as where and when you were born, can make a huge difference. Measured IQ may afford an advantage, but only to a point. Those intent on the big prize must perfect their craft over the course of 10,000 hours, just as Bill Gates, the Beatles, and Michael Jordan did.",2011-05-17,Estados Unidos

"Ron G. Cheek, PhD",1,Stating the Obvious - Missing the Outliers,"Stating the Obvious - Missing the Outliers. Since the publication of the ""Tipping Point"" I have used Gladwell's book in many of my lectures and required reading for graduate students. Yet just as I was delighted with that work, I was equally disappointed with ""Outliers."" His findings stated the obvious.  Parental support combined with opportunity/chance provides the landscape for amazing success stories.  Are these outliers or merely the results of strong parental support? Certainly culture, environment, and other variables combined play a role in success.  It would seem that the true outliers would be those that came from lower income families. These families were concerned with economic survival that no time was available to support the educational needs of their children.  When children from this background and despite the odds achieved success, they would truly be the outliers. From the perspective of ""Outliers"" we shouldn't waste any time whatsoever with them, they can't possibly succeed!",2008-12-08,Estados Unidos

nona sark,2,Phylosophicaly Dated & Scued.,"Phylosophicaly Dated & Scued.. So, I just read chapter 9 from Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. The title is, Marita's Bargain. The context is a Bronx school program called KIPP and inner city disadvantaged kids. The disadvantage being, middle class parents building up their kids during the summer break while poor kids just languish over the summer doing nothing. He upset me when he said, ""It is not the brightest who succeed, If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is rather, a gift."" Got that folks, we are not in charge of our own destiny. You didn't build any thing you think you worked hard for. I just lost total respect for this mans writing abilities, which I might add, he's just lucky he has. He even goes as far as saying, anyone of us could be in Bill Gate's shoes and accomplished the same thing given the same scenario. What a crock.",2012-11-14,Estados Unidos

W. Adams,1,McSuccess,"McSuccess. This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists.  However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful.  I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations.  After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A.  Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause.  Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era.  Duhhhh. What makes his ""research"" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation.  For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable.  In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion?  Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.",2009-10-26,Estados Unidos

Mr. Gladwell remarks regarding this topic is utterly false. One does NOT have to be born in Jan. or Feb. to succeed in hockey. The star Sydney Crosby was born on Aug.7th, Brooks Orpik Sept.26th, Ryan Miller July 17th, Marc Andre Fleury Nov.28th, and a famous "" oldie "" Mario Lemieux Oct.5th.........And the list goes on.......",2010-03-04,Estados Unidos

Let the students read the classics, new books, science fiction, autobiographies, graphic novels, basically ANYTHING but this bore! In a few hundred years, a new breed of human (or maybe aliens) will be digging up remains of our civilization and questioning it's demise, and they'll uncover the Outliers, see teachers attempt to force their students to read and learn from it, and quickly realize why we went downhill.
