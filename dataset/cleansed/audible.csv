Gaggleframpf,1,Not Really About Outliers.,"Not Really About Outliers.. This books title leads you to believe that it's going to talk about statistical outliers, but it only nominally does that. Gladwell ignores actual outliers in the teeth of the statistical cases he presents.",2019-09-30

GW Support,1,Don’t dilute your potential with this book,"Don’t dilute your potential with this book. This book’s entire theme is basically that chance determines your successes in life. Hard work, preserverence, determination, commitment and resilience are qualities that this book does not celebrate. Instead, it focuses on culture, upbringing, date of birth and chance. If you are looking for self improvement, I would highly recommend skipping this title and reading books like “The secret of the ages” by Robert Collier, “The power of your subconscious mind” by dr Joseph Murphy, “The richest man in Babylon” by George S. Clason etc.",2019-02-15
Scott T. Hards,3,"Engaging, but overrated","Engaging, but overrated. Outliers has many interesting statistical anecdotes sprinkled throughout, to be sure.  My interest was held.  But at its core, the book's central theme is simply ""successful people are aided in their success by their families, culture, education and other chance factors.  They could not have done it alone.""  This is not exactly a particularly profound revelation.  Gladwell repeatedly asserts that most people think Bill Gates-type successes are simply due to that person's raw talent and little else.  But is that really the case?  Does anybody really think Bill Gates could have achieved what he did had he been born in Botswana, for example?  What's more, while crediting these outside factors with making these ""outliers"" possible, he fails to note that in almost every case, hundreds if not thousands or even more other people had virtually identical birth situations, yet failed to achieve greatness.  Gladwell's goal seems to be an attempt to take the shine off of society's great success stories by, in effect, claiming they just got lucky.  But I think the formula for producing an outlier is more complex than that.  Too often in this book, Gladwell seems to be profoundly stating the obvious.",2008-12-13
KevinH,5,Captivating (if not an outlier),"Captivating (if not an outlier). Regardless of what you ultimately think of the author's analysis, Gladwell is a masterful storyteller, weaving together interesting anecdotes from such diverse sources as plane crash research to hillbilly feuds to standardized math tests.  That Gladwell narrates the audio book himself adds greatly to the listening experience.  Critics will complain that his thesis is obvious (that opportunity, cultural inheritence and hard work play key roles in success), or that his examples are selective and ignore in turn outliers that don't illustrate his points -- or, somewhat inconsistently, both.  But Gladwell's books are successful because he examines phenomena and topics of importance in an accessible and entertaining way.  No one should mistake Malcolm Gladwell for a big thinker like, say, Stephen J. Gould, but Gladwell would be the first one to tell you that he's no outlier.  Don't accept everything the author says as truth revealed, but do listen to this book -- it's one of the best non-fiction offerings available through Audible.",2008-11-21
Sher from Provo,4,Very Interesting!,"Very Interesting!. Gladwell sets out to explain how the top people in any field were able to get there.  The explanations can be very surprising.  I was very engaged throughout the whole book.  He talked a lot about education, and having been a public school teacher for the last 27 years, I found it absorbing, hopeful, and found myself wishing that I had known some of these things 27 years ago.",2012-04-12
Chris,2,This book should be called 'selective evidence',"This book should be called 'selective evidence'. Whilst a lot of the ideas in this book are not Gladwell's alone, he takes responsibility for presenting them as if they were fact. Some parts are fascinating - such as the investigation of pilot errors which lead to crashes - but much of it falls woefully short of sound argument. The main points in the book are either obvious or highly questionable: intelligence alone is no trigger for success; luck is big factor in all great achievements; 10,000 hours of practice is required to achieve excellence at anything.",2010-08-23
Robert W,3,Intriguing but the research is questionable,"Intriguing but the research is questionable. This book is quite intriguing, but often as I listened I began to wonder about his research methodology. His facts, while compelling seem to be only part of the picture and I began to wonder as to how much picking and choosing of facts was going on to support his points. His determination to support his rather deterministic view is clear throughout the piece.",2009-05-09
Luiz C Payne,5,Great audio book,"Great audio book. The content was entertaining and fascinating. A lot of ""oh wow"" moments. What was really good was Malcolm's read. He is an excellent reader--right on point with his inflection and cadence. I thought it had to be a professional reader.",2009-03-07
Russ,1,Interesting but stupid,"Interesting but stupid. The research and data are interesting but his conclusions are dumb.  He comes right out and says that he is trying to debunk the ""myth"" that hard work and good choices bring success and instead tries to reduce all human success to a sort of lottery game.",2011-08-03
Andrew,4,Not as revelatory as you'd think,"Not as revelatory as you'd think. It takes lots of actual practice to master something. It also takes opportunities that are not in our control. So basically, Gladwell is trying to prove Calvinism (hard work + predestination). Pinpointing the web of circumstances that leads to success is something that we obsess over as a culture and Gladwell provides a very interesting analysis of how this works. But I do not feel like I heard any revelations here that I did not learn from my father when he encouraged me to get internships as an undergraduate.",2011-11-28
S Prabhu,5,Excellent book; well adapted for the audio format,Excellent book; well adapted for the audio format. Unusual take on a topic that is taken for granted. The author's voice enhances the message-highly recommended audiobook-perhaps my best book of the year!,2008-12-27
UX1,3,"Too many examples, not enough ideas...",,2012-04-11
Ben,1,Leftism supported by cherry-picked data and bias,"Leftism supported by cherry-picked data and bias. Gladwell's central theme is the notion of the correlation between diligence, hard work and success is mistaken. He uses various examples of elite success and attributes the outcome to competative or situational advantages. He however dismisses the fact that in every example both advantage and personal perserverance, hard work and above average work ethic are clearly present. Gladwell would have done a better job to conclude that his outliers are borne of both advantage and excellence combined rather than allow personal bias to blind himself to half of his own book.",2019-02-05
Margaret,5,Very good parenting book,"Very good parenting book. This is a very good book in the same way Freaknomics was a very good economics book.  It goes beyond the myths of how to become successful.  If you have young kids, it is also a very good parenting book, on what you should be aware of to give your kids the best chance to succeed.",2009-05-12
Roy,5,An Eye Opener,"An Eye Opener. This book describes why some individuals seem to excell and others do not. Every chapter takes on a different group and explain what has led to their success.  The analysis is so interesting particularly when the reader realizes what has been going on right before his/her eyes.  The chapter on Canadian Hockey Players leaves the listener wondering ""why didn't I see that?"" The section on when children should start to Kindergarten is helpful as well. I subscribe to Audible to be informed about areas foreign to me.  This book is one I am glad I didn't miss.  The reading is great, the audio clear, the content easy to follow.",2009-02-28
Stephen,4,Are you and outlier?  How did you become one?,"Are you and outlier?  How did you become one?. The outliers in this book are people who have either succeeded or failed beyond expectation.  Besides intelligence, what other factors make people extremely successful?  Some of the questions that are posed and answered are:",2009-03-18
Rob,3,Proof Through Anecdote?,Proof Through Anecdote?. I always enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's work whether it be in book form or the short pieces he does for The New Yorker - but I can't help thinking that he's becoming the era's Proof By Anecdote expert.  'Outliers' is interesting but perhaps more formulaic than it ought to be.,2009-08-14
Eliana,3,Mildly Disappointing,"Mildly Disappointing. I really enjoy Gladwell's articles for The New Yorker, and I've read his other two books, but in this one I found the evidence he presents for his ""thesis"" to be flimsy at best.  It's posing as science, but awash in anecdotal evidence. I had a hard time taking it seriously after a while. I would not recommend to a friend except in excerpts.",2009-01-17
Michael,5,Excellent!,"Excellent!. Gladwell is a fine writer and this book, in the same style as Blink, explores the real factors that contribute to the success of those we think are so above and beyond us (Bill Gates, the Beatles, etc.).  Gladwell makes it clear that their talent, drive, energy, and intelligence WERE key to their success but that these, alone, would not have done it for them.  They needed unusual opportunities. In fact, the opportunities given them that were not given others were as important to their achievements as their personal qualities.  This book helps reduce the ""superstars"" down to human level.  If you had been given the opportunities these were, you might have achieved what they did or more!",2009-03-08
A. Yoshida,5,Classic Book,"Classic Book. Even after reading this book a second time years later, the content is still original and entertaining. We often think that outliers (those special, exceptional people) are disciplined, self-made successful people. That is not the case. It is the environment, support system, and other factors that can make an ordinary person into an extraordinary person. I recommend skipping chapters 6 and 7 about family feuds in the Appalachian and South Korean airplane crashes and coming back to at the end. Those chapters demonstrate how culture can be a detriment to a person's success.",2020-04-19

funkevin,4,Very thought provoking.,Very thought provoking.. This book caused me to re-evaluate my perceptions of success and how it is achieved. It is a great listen for parents of young children since parents can have a major influence on many of the contributing factors of success that are mentioned in this book. Enjoyable on many levels.,2010-01-25
Thomas Nedreberg,5,Taking the mystery out of Outliers,"Taking the mystery out of Outliers. I've seen Malcom Gladwell speak twice and read both ""Tipping Point"" and ""Blink,"" which I really enjoyed but ""Outliers"" is his crowning work. The book is written in an organized way yet displays profound out the box thinking. Many of us like to think of our heros as truely exceptional people but Mr. Gladwell shows us in his book that many times it's taking what's been given to us, practicing, and being in the right place at the right time. I enjoyed the entire book but what most impressed me was his personal tale about himself, his mother, and grandmother and how being an Outlier has more to do with what went before us then what we actually were able to do ourselves. I liked how the book made me think about how even if I wasn't an Outlier that by me  providing opportunities as a teacher or a parent that I may help a future Outlier.",2009-11-09
Sierra Bravo,4,Some interesting thoughts to ponder,"Some interesting thoughts to ponder. This is a well-written book that brings up some important things to think about.  Gladwell's conclusion that you need to be lucky as well smart and hardworking to be hugely successful is probably true.  To get really far out on the bell curve you need for everything to go right, or wrong, depending on which side of the curve.  Still it is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from extreme outliers, at least when dealing with a standard bell curve.  If you are interested in what makes rich people rich read ""The Millionaire Next Door"", it deals with the more applicable part of the curve for most of us.  Drawing conclusions from relatively few data points is always risky but Gladwell shows clearly the a small head start can get you far ahead.",2009-06-24

I was born in the wrong month.  Who knew?  I was hooked from the first sentence to the last.  It is very reassuring to know that people who have changed the world we live in are maybe not that different from any of us, but were instead at the right place at the right time.  This book will make us all want to go out and change our educational system, look at what country the pilot of our plane grew up in and marvel that our Scottish ancestors took time out from their  violent inclinations to have kids.  Malcolm Gladwell has a gift for taking on topics that I have not found that interesting and turning them into mind twisters that delight.  If he will now explain our economy we would all be better of for it!",2009-03-28

Kitty,1,Statistical Stupidity,"Statistical Stupidity. In a culture of conformity, it doesn't take a rocket scientist or even a statistician to predict that success is predicated on an individual's environment.  This is not a book about outliers.  It is a statistical substitution of social determinism for true accomplishment.",2013-03-19
Koh Bock Huat,2,Not Convince By His Reasoning,"Not Convince By His Reasoning. After many rave reviews, I expected to enjoy the book but I didn't. I thought the point that success is factored upon opportunity and having the support of influential ppl was obvious. And you don't need a scientific research to figure that out or there is a need to proof it. However, I think he forgot that opportunities can be pursued and not brought to you and that's one major factor of successful ppl. In some cases, opportunities is a greater factor while in some cases the personal drive plays a greater role. I still feel it cannot be generalized.",2009-12-29
Gohar,4,A new perspective to success,A new perspective to success. This book talks about successful people and how everything around them helped them get there. There were a few chapters that were stretched just to make a point. Certain chapters like the first one where the author keeps on talking about hockey players born in January was very slow and boring. but the latter ones with software entrepreneurs was very interesting. Malcolm Gladwell doesn't say anything new here except for the fact that every individual needs to work hard and practice makes perfect. The only difference here is the amount of research the author has gathered is remarkable and many of his facts and researches prove a point. The epilogue chapter was completely unrequired. I gave a 4 rating beacuse of those certain unrequired chapters. Great research and a good book to read once.,2009-05-19
Erfan Reed,1,Biggest Pile of BS since The Secret,"Biggest Pile of BS since The Secret.

DeFoe,1,Simply a terrible book,"Simply a terrible book. The reasoning in this book was very thin.  Gladwell takes a few anecdotal examples and builds a tremendously over-simplified theory of success.  For example, he pontificates that the Beatles were successful because they had played long hours in a Homburg club, as if that were the only factor to their success.  I found the book cloying and I really sorry I wasted my money on it.",2012-01-07
Ron,3,Fair enough,"Fair enough. I can see why a lot of people can take good things from this book and apply them to their personal situation. But for me, this book didn't reveal anything new and spectacular. It made some fairly interesting and relevant observations and provided proof to support theories well enough. But there was a lot of repetition which always goes against the validity of an argument. And the main concepts of the thesis were fairly obvious, no real innovations. But I did learn a fair bit of History and Biographies. This book didn't change my life but it was an interesting read. And the fact that the author narrated really helped him drag the point across.",2009-06-24

Mac,3,Good but wrong about science,"Good but wrong about science. Gladwell writes an interesting book here and he is certainly brings forth many interesting stories and examples of environmental influences on kid's outcomes.  I think he overplays his hand a bit and ignores much of what biological science say about theses things.  For example Asian kids being better at math, well they are still better at math even when they are raised in or adopted into another culture or country.  Maybe rice farming did make them better at math, but this characteristic goes beyond mere culture because you can remove culture and it still remains.  The same goes for much of the other topics in the book.  There's a bit of liberal fantasy about the whole thing, like Gladwell wishes the world were a certain way and then just starts pretending it is as he wishes, regardless of contrary evidence.",2021-03-04

Fausto Cepeda,2,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected. So, it seems that people that have success were just in the right moment, raised by the right family and were born at the appropriate time. Even the mother of the author. I can agree in some of the points made by the author; yes, those people were in certain circumstances that they took advantage of and bum! Success was the consequence. So, if you just want to hear the stories of these people and what circumstances surrounded them to be successful then go ahead and buy the book. But, and here is a breaking point, if you want to learn something of these stories to apply it to your own life and maybe also be successful, then that’s another different story, the book won’t provide it to you so easily. You have to interpret it. My interpretation is that you have to be aware of your own “circumstances”, your strengths and your advantages that life provides you, and you have to be able to take advantage of them. That’s it. If you are blind to those advantages or circumstances that you have, then you won’t catch them and you won’t be successful or don’t as successful as you could be. So open your eyes. Be aware and know what time you are living, and “see” what you have in your favor. I am not sure that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs were aware or what they have in their hands and they consciously took advantage at that time…maybe after 30 years they were able to see it, but well, that’s another discussion.",2019-11-28

This is an interesting counter narrative to the often told success story of the individual who rises to greatness despite hardships.

But as someone who has indeed become successful because of hard work, I somehow came away from this book feeling diminished.",2019-07-31
Jim,1,Fiction,"Fiction. The ""Story"" of Success is a good title.  There is a great deal of ""storytelling"" done in the book. Mr. Gladwell attempts to strictly correlate success and circumstance.

Charles,3,Disappointed,"Disappointed. Throughout the book, the author uses narratives of several famous Individuals to generalize to the population. In effect, he attempts to validate his perspective with scattered anecdotal evidence. I found this somewhat misrepresentative during the progression of the book and then it all made sense listening to the interview at the end.  The author purposefully planned the book as an ""assault on rugged individualism""--his description.  He appears to do this to advance some sociopolitical perspective (again, listen to the interview). Sure, circumstances and opportunity play a role in all our lives, not only the rich or famous.  The hockey team story is way overblown. Could 6 more months of physical and emotional maturity make a difference in adolescent athletes? Sure, but are not most sophomore athletes better than their freshman year? Yes, it is simply development, practice, and competitive play. That some are denied opportunity because of these factors and it is unfair is nonsense. The author also seems to discount all the other intra-individual characteristics that could be significant factors in the courses of these lives and the outcomes of the stories. If you have ever made something out of nothing by virtue of your determination, had insights and developed some innovative project, or creatively solved a dilemma, you may not like this book. According to the author's perspective, you just got lucky and then anyone could have done the rest. He magnifies one factor in the equation disproportionally and minimizes the other contributors. I enjoyed Blink, but he's off target here.  These are interesting stories, which is why I suspect so many people rate the book so highly.  Anecdotes do not equal evidence.",2014-11-07

Jeff Harris,3,A Dramatic Statement of the Somewhat Obvious,"A Dramatic Statement of the Somewhat Obvious. This book came highly recommended from a few friends and coworkers as a thought-provoking and almost groundbreaking book about what makes the outliers of society so successful. A big part of the book emphasizes that the rags to riches story is more the result of being given the right opportunity at the right time. When you stop and think about how someone like Bill Gates became so successful, you know that he had to have everything in his life line up. There are thousands of cases of people who are very smart but just don't have the opportunity to succeed and become extremely wealthy. While Gladwell does bring up some good examples to support his main thesis, he often over simplifies things with statements like in order to become a great hockey player you have to be born in January. The reasoning makes sense, but it throws out any other variable that may come into play and it seems like he almost wants to discredit an individual's drive and natural ability.",2013-01-30

I enjoyed his premises, though I do not necessarily agree with all of them. I had a difficult time for example, linking the rice paddy work ethic to the success of Asians in math. But I enjoy reading opinions and research and that is exactly what Gladwell combined here. I was also hoping for a summary that included what we average people can do for ourselves that might place us closer to the kind of outliers he selected for this study.

Gladwell's message--that success is more about nurture than nature; along with importance of being in the right place at the right time--these are not new conclusions.

Thomas,1,not drinking the cool-aid,"not drinking the cool-aid. I just did not find this book that compelling, much less convincing. The author is a master at taking a series of observations and making a circumstantial case for a point, but then never critically assessing whether his assertions are correct by looking at them in some objective manner. The hypothesis is that there are random but predictable factors control our fate.  So here is the problem. It is easy to look retrospectively and say, Bill gates is who he is because someone bought a computer for his 8th grade class which gave him a unique opportunity. So if that purchase was the key for bill, what happened to all his classmates and why don't we know anything about them.  Another hypothesis is that its really the extent to which you practise that determines your outcome, so really successful musicians are there because they practiced more over the years. Umm, but what led them to practise so much more at an early age? The author acts like he has solved the nature vs. nurture; argument, but it is not so simple.  Then ther is the statements that once you reach a certain basic level of height for basketball players or intelligence for the rest of us, that additional height or intelligence does not matter.  Umm, why do BB players get measured to the millimeter at pre-NBA draft camps, and why does their stock fall if a player is found to only be 6-6, instead of 6-8, and why are there so many slow relatively clumsy 7-0 white guys sitting on rosters if height above 6-2 does not matter.",2009-09-10

Outliers is the third of his groundbreaking takes on a facet of modern life. His premise is that chance and opportunity play a much larger part in success than anyone cares to admit. He uses examples varying from teenage hockey players in Canada and teenage soccer players from Europe to Bill Gates and Bill Joy. The number of the richest people in the world born during the same decade in the same country. Why are  some people able to find success in certain eras. Why some can't in others.

I’m not sure what the hidden agenda is but Gladwell tried to force feed you ideas with shabby and one sided success stories. You could easily take from this book that if you weren’t born into the right socioeconomic class for you’re particular field of interest and you might as well just give up and go home. True Bill Gates had a great advantage that he had an open computer terminal at the age of 13 Gladwell presents the story as if he and his colleagues were the only ones on the face of the planet with such an opportunity. It’s just not true he tells half a story in order to make a point that can’t be really supported any other way.  That’s only one example of the mini holes in his ideas.  I enjoyed the book thinking fast and slow but there he basically reported on findings without necessarily injecting his own ideas and his own agenda into the writing.

There are a lot of ppl who will read this book and think to themselves I am not afforded any privileges by any means, therefore I can not have the success of bill gates or Ben franklin.

I'm also looking at how I'm going about my own career and I'm seeing why I've had success and wondering if there were other reasons and if I can create new success,2021-03-28

It is not that some are phenomenally smarter better faster than others (while a little of that plays a part), but it is how the conditions in your personal ecosystem  combined with your hard work and use of talent make way to outlying circumstances of success. Phenomenal book, and the author reads it to you himself. Could not ask for more. The performance of the read was equally satisfying and of high caliber.

Ms.Ravelled,5,the man never disappoints,"the man never disappoints. Reading a book by Malcolm Gladwell is like sitting across the kitchen table from a sibling or a cousin who's just enough older that he's had time to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, to see the interconnections you haven't lived long enough to notice, and to lead the conversation with wit, humor, and humility. In a world of pusillanimous blatherskytes, his is a voice of reason and civility.",2020-09-05

The author finds obscure people and situations then tells the rest of the story. However, when the author goes off on philosophical curiosities, then the story is destroyed. He copies the hockey story from Freakonomics and doesn't give credit. As far as me the reader/listener, I can draw my own curiosities. Thanks Gladwell  for some good stories.

Interestingly enough, it allowed me to examine my own life and recognize the opportunities, or lack of, that have been presented to me and how those have attributed to my successes and those of my families generations back. The thesis of Outliers is unique and challenges the western culture belief of the individual success. I think it is absolutely fantastic and recommend it to all.",2020-08-18
Mary E. Evans aka Maryee,5,Better late than never,"Better late than never. This book makes me think of how it would be nice if Gladwell was able to produce and get an elementary, middle or high school version of this book into the hands of millions of little Black and Brown skinned children. If these books made it into the classroom or written into curriculum, #1 it would change the trajectory of thousands of teachers who otherwise might overlook something special in their students motivating them to find opportunities for their students, and #2 it might change the trajectory or thousands of ""hidden outlier"" children who otherwise might overlook something special in themselves, their gifts and abilities. Their would be a heighten sensitivity to always be on the lookout to give children of all gifts, talents, ability, drive and determination opportunities to become more successful than they would ever imagined.",2020-08-15

This author highlights the impact of circumstances or chance on success.

Loren,5,Conflicted,Conflicted.

Jessica Reyer,4,Superman Might Not be so Super,"Superman Might Not be so Super. I like that this book took a different approach to those that seem to rise above the rest. Gladwell did not glorify, rather, brought them back down to the ground for us to see. It actually follows suit with thoughts on who you surround yourself with  and being at the right time in the right place. It isn't the individual as much as having access to the opportunity and proper support. Superman isn't super without his powers nor did he himself create his powers. The one rub with this book is the narration. Gladwell has this sinister tone that would be good as a villain in a1920s detective story or a Batman villain.",2020-07-13

But after listening to it, I see why they only raved over very minimal parts. The lessons of ""outliers"" and what they are is very valid and informative, almost inspirational even, but after over 7 hours of listening I maybe took away 4 truly VALUABLE lessons that accounted for less tha  an hour of my listening time. This book is unnecessarily long and a lot of the information within doesnt really serve to enhance the lessons this book means to express.

Gladwell is an excellent researcher, phenomenal writer, and a fantastic reader perfectly suited for Audible. I’m grateful for every chapter of this book. His premise, privilege of race and opportunity are the destroyers of a belief in rugged individualism is debunked by his own research into those who’s drive to succeed lead them to prepare, to take any advantage they could find, and never to quit in a country that rewards those who do such.  Gladwell’s remarkable research also proves that parents are the greatest influence in a child’s success or lack thereof.  Parents instill work ethic, feed or starve emotional intelligence, and elevate or lower their children’s view of their own potential in the world.  His assertion that uncontrollable forces such as time of birth and family of birth only reinforce the truth that parents should consider their role sacred.",2020-07-07

I’m also a foreign language teacher and by default culture is very interesting to me. The interplay of culture and time and how we are unwittingly and sometimes unwillingly influenced by them is great food for thought, as is the downplay of being self made and the ideology of individualism.",2020-07-03

However, he neglects to mention the importance of mindset as well as personality traits such as self awareness and stepping out of your comfort zone in order to PUT yourself in positions to receive more opportunities which I’m sure many would argue are the other major factors in success.

The last episode is an interview with Gladwell and I really enjoyed him. So then I started listening to Talking With Strangers, and I LOVED it. Then I listened to Outliers and since then I’ve finished David and Goliath. Malcolm Gladwell is the perfect narrator for his own books. He doesn’t feel the need to impose himself on the listening experience and at the same time, he knows exactly where the emphasis needs to be. He is masterful at this genre and I can’t wait to listen to everything else he’s written/narrated.",2020-04-21

Also, much of the circumstances that we find ourselves are products of our of own choices.

The overall message is that success is as much a product of a persons upbringing, culture and circumstances, as it is to how hard that person worked or how 'smart' they are. I liked that Malcolm concluded with the fact that anyone is capable of being successful as long as they are given the opportunity to practise their talents, but I can see how this opinion might be a little depressing to those who feel like they've missed out or were not offered these opportunities.",2020-03-04

It fails to hit on one important point though: the people discussed in the stories still had to put in an incredible amount of work. This point is barely touched on, almost passed over. Yes the people discussed had incredible opportunity thanks to the times and locations and even months they were born. But this is never enough. You still have to put in the work. The author almost makes it seem like anyone could have been Bill Gates born under the right conditions. I disagree. Not everyone with access to a computer in the late 1960’s would get out of bed at 2:30AM to program at 3:00AM. Plain and simple. The outliers are the people who engaged in incredibly hard work, and had some luck and help and opportunity along the way. The work still had to be done though. I agree with what the author is saying mostly, and yet I find it a bit discrediting to people’s achievements. I believe this is the other extreme of the individualism scale talking.

Although I agree with this point of view to an extent , it is not the full story. The truth is privilege is a factor but not the only variable in successful. Effort & focus are better predictors of success because any person has control over those. Just saying people are privileged if they’re successful doesn’t help anyone in fact it hurts society by instilling doubt in the individual due to his lack of privilege.",2019-12-03

I however still feel there is a missing link. Yes, Bill Gates did have opportunity at the age of 13, but so did all the other 13 year olds in his privileged school. The state of the art computer room wasn't just his. Yet, they didn't start a multibillion empire. It takes an inherent outlying characteristic to grab the opportunity and run with it.

I do think Malcom does miss an opportunity that perhaps he will work on in a secomd book.  Malcom takes the long standing argument between librals and conservatives of accountability vs circumstance and supports enviornmental influences on peoples lives with very high quality arguments. I really appreciate the quailty of the reaarch and the well placed word while making the argument of nuture over nature.  The point he misses is at the end he calls for change at the societal level and rebridges the gap between librals and conservatives.  I think Malcom need to take his findings, keep the persuasion of the influence of the envioronment on success, but then focus on the HOW wnvironment was overcome and promote individual accountability to change not just societal pressures but personal or cultural changes that people have power over.  I kept expecting that part two would show how thechange of Korean Airs saftey record was implenented, the hard choices to make cultural changes are to lightly pressed upon. Had he focused on How succesfull organizations (including familes) used the understanding of culture to change their outcomes or even understanding, Malcom would have briged the gap between liberals and conservatives and more than likely, over time exerted more influence of the necessary socitial changea he belives should be made.",2019-11-07

wes,2,Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell,"Carl Marx would love your construct Mr. Gladwell. The author combines the envious theory of  socialism, mixed with self guilt, adds a dash of interesting stories and  comes up with a transparent, flat manifesto of ""Free Societies are Fake"". He leads with a story of how the DOB of kids in elite Canadian hockey predicates their success.  It hooks the reader.  The story has merit and is interesting.  There are a couple more catchy tales like the Montana rancher vs. Oppenhiemer and the Chinese rice farmer and rationale how the Chinese language is better for math. After these however it becomes clear that Mr. Gladwell wrote this book to push his beliefs that socialism is far superior a free society.  Mr. Gladwell,  IT HAS BEEN TRIED and failed all over the world.  Eventually you simply out of other people's money to spent.  The idea that there could have been hundreds or thousands of Bill Gates' if computers would have been supplied to everyone is purely a utopian pipe drem but it is an approach Socialists have asserted many times throughout history.  One of the key elements the author chooses to exclude are the choices people make. Granted, if every person would have made the same choices as Bill Gates when afforded the use of computers then there would have been more Bill Gates' but we are talking about living breathing human beings and it simply doesn't translate.  Choices are a much more important component in a free society than in a socialism/communism.  The author's rhetoric really only accomplishes 2 things.  Number one, it decreases his feelings of self guilt for being born into a  ""privileged and entitled"" family.  Quite simply, it makes him feel better about himself and number two it improves his public  appearance by using his ""entitlement and privilege"" for the good of all those less fortunate. Again, an attempt to make himself feel better.   It is clear that you despise the thought that a person can be independent.  I don't know where or why you have formed these concepts but I bet it is a product of how YOUR surroundings have influenced YOU. I gave your book 5 stars for the specific stories you tell but had to subtract three stars for the way you use them to justify the worn out idea of Socialism.  I hope you will take all the money you make from you book sales and use it top make your self feel better because you are such a good person you deserve to feel good about yourself...in fact you are entitled to it.",2019-10-30

This is, of course, in direct contradiction to the conventional ideas we usually attribute success to. i.e. Individuals are solely responsible for their success, and hard work alone is the key to finding said success.  Gladwell does not challenge the idea of hard-work, but he does emphasize that it’s only one part of an overall mix of contributing factors.

Melissa,4,"Good book, but overlooks obvious things.","Good book, but overlooks obvious things.. Basic thesis of the book: people are only successful due in large part to opportunities afforded them (which come in various forms, culture, computer access, birthday, type of job their parents had etc). While yes these opportunities are huge—Bill Gates wouldn’t have become the person he is without the Mom’s club buying that computer for his school. (Example from the book) He wasn’t the only kid at that school who had access to that opportunity. On a more broad scale, yes a January Birthday is an advantage to aspiring Canadian hockey players but not all those who are born in January go pro. There are deeper levels in the individual outliers that enable them to achieve. Even taking his theory at face value, wouldn’t the real outliers be the pro players born in December?? Study them. The January kid should succeed. (Again this is another example from the book). I think the book makes a good point that a lot of times successful people had incredible advantages, what it doesn’t delve into is the difference between them and the other people who had the exact same advantages!",2019-02-17
tootalou,1,Long-winded tunnel vision,"Long-winded tunnel vision. I thought the chapter (s?) about air travel would never end! Aside from that, I found too many missing variables as to explain success. The author fails to give credit for individual pioneers, yet ironically gives credit to a collective of group thought. Individuals, particularly religious ones, have historically lost EVERYTHING (family, land, wealth, status, etc) in an attempt to raise the standard across cultures. Many of them have been ostracized or stoned to death by the collective because they like their concubines. They like having slaves. And they love their power. The USA was built on a culture of individualism because it CREATES. It was also built upon the fortitude of individuals who have continually shattered the culture of collectivism.  Should they succeed, and be rewarded for their success? YES, because they pave the way for others to live their own individual dreams, and keep building layers, as well. Bill Gates' story is an example of a mentor who fought HARD, you can bet, to obtain or create the equipment Bill learned by. As evidenced by the fact that it wasn't available to the collective, because for the whole, their standard is lower. Individuals reject the bucket of lobsters trying to pull them back down and find a way to climb out. Making a lot of money for their effort is an organic side effect. Idividualism is the crust holding in the apple pie. Without it, we just have applesauce.",2019-02-17

It seems a hefty read so I am appreciative of this audio narrative format. The examples and cases cited in the text elaborate on his general thoughts and appear to be mostly thought out. There are several cases however, such as the folks in the Appalachians or the Chinese and mathematics,  that seem quite a stretch and, for me, not entirely plausible. Not that they, or other cases, are lacking in evidence or researched argumentation, just that what is presented for some of the cases does not make convincing justifications for the thesis of that particular chapter (again, such as folks feuding in Appalachia or Chinese and mathematical ability). It's an interesting book and take on patterns we encounter in everyday life, but I just don't think the justification for each chapter's thesis was entirely plausible.",2019-01-30

Al Tunnell,5,Great Insight into Success,"Great Insight into Success. Gladwell's paints a picture to describe success that follows a different narrative than the traditional tale.   There are some fascinating conclusions about the impact of environment.   With that said, I think he dismisses, personal vision and the extent to which some people maximize their opportunities versus others.  The people in his narrative fully explored/exploited those opportunities,  but dismissing missed opportunities is careless.   Its just impossible to write a book about the innovations unrealized from the lack of vision or persistence because we never have the innovation to marvel upon.    Instead we can only deconstruct the product of the extreme success.   His points on cultural legacy seem very good.    Great read!",2018-11-02

But he doesn’t really talk much about «grabbing» the opportunities that is in front of you, or creating opportunities out of what seems to not be one to others.

Great anecdotes and insights, but the book doesn’t bother to tie these findings about circumstance back to the central theme of becoming a successful person or “outlier” yourself, which I assume is its mission. For some I imagine it would actually achieve the opposite goal, an existential fear of always being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” through its extreme determinist viewpoint.

He particularly addresses the idea of the ""self-made man"" and how the ultra-successful are actually products of their particular time and place just as much products of their own talents.

They maybe outliers because of unique opportunities but they are also outliers because of their rugged individualism and hard work. What nation has  rugged individualists and hard work as their core?

The cultural background, date of birth and opportunities at work, wealth and parenting types. He does a great job explaining the importance of all of these things but frankly over simplifies and boils success down to almost only these things. He refers to "" individual ruggedness"" as dangerous and discounts individual performance and success to a community effort. He makes some very good points but he simply points out why the ""outliers""  the Bill Gates of the world succeeded because of there time, place, and opportunities combined with his hard work to become something fantastic. His theory does not explain how most of us non outliers can be successful given very similar circumstances.   In short this book is an oversimplification of a very small group of people.",2018-05-14

Being shaped myself but our individualistic Western culture I was blind to the answers before me until Gladwell happily shown a light on the truest explanation.

Rishik Dhar,4,Great subject. Powerful examples.,"Great subject. Powerful examples.. Very good subject, I am fully aligned with the core assertion that all of us are primarily result of circumstances and opportunities we get in life, but the author's treatment of this assertion neglects to highlight a core idea, that making the most of an opportunity is the responsibility of an individual. Talented or not, one must have the ability to persevere in order to succeed. Making relevant personal choices in a timely manner and being willing to pay the price for reaching a goal is as central to the idea of success as opportunity is. Foresight and conviction, open-mindedness and intrinsic drive,  optimism and patience are all such traits that make a successful individual. Nature of an individual who just doesn't give a damn will always overpower the nurturing received from a caring set of parents or community that believes in them and wishes to invest in them. We can't just claim that an older sibling ends up more successful because they received the undivided attention of parents. That by definition would make older siblings more successful in a statistically significant way. However, that's not what we see. Even innate talent is useful for a person who doesn't show the aforementioned traits and an attitude for self-correction and life long learning.",2017-09-30

James,5,Insightful and Engaging Read,"Insightful and Engaging Read. Incredible book. My favorite among Gladwells works. The insights seem so commonse, yet are often rejected by a social narrative around self made people. If anything, Outliers outlines and forcefully makes the case that luck and timing have as much to do with our individual successes as hard work and dedication. Not that those virtues dont matter - they do - but it is when they are combined with things outside our control that we see incredible people emerge. In a more subtle way the book is also a condemnation on societys failure to give more children the opportunities that a select few have been given. The author rhetorically asks, ""how many more Bill Gates would we have had if a million teenagers had been given the same opportunities as him?"" Its reminiscent of Bobby Kennedys often quoted line: ""Some men see things as they are and ask why? I dream things that never were and ask why not?""

There is a fair amount of liberal thinking garbage in the book that I had to cringe through, but if you keep an open eye to the deeper point of the book and take from it the facts to expand your mind, the book becomes a must read. In the end the message I decide to take and partly the message the author gives is, that we all for the most part live in a situation or world with unlimited possibilities. Yes some people had it a little easier, but ultimately your hard work and dedication to something will result in your success. Recognize your place and time in life and try to identify the leg up that's been offered to you. Exploit that through hard work and be a success!",2017-08-25

Ismail,5,One of its kind,"One of its kind. The book was recommended to me by a good colleague since she saw my aptitude for early childhood experiences that in my opinion not only shape our ego but also our vision and purpose in life. For me it was clear that next to the intelligence given to us these experiences matter most. Being born and raised between two cultures I could also conclude the importance of culture, beliefs and tradition to the education and early childhood experiences.  Which I totally left out in my view of success was pure opportunity and LUCK. That is so beautiful that it hurts that Bill Gates and Stave Jobs - great minds and leaders without a doubt - are creations of 'being at the right time at the right place.",2017-03-03

kristy,5,Focus is Necessary,"Focus is Necessary. Malcolm Gladwell is a modern day genius. His research is impeccable and his presentation, moving. The amount of information placed in each chapter is substantial and there are multiple different stories included in each chapter to paint an image of the principal presented. The variety of stories, from well known celebrities to lesser-known communities, adds a three-dimensional texture to the overwhelming truth of the substance shared. I continually felt ideas and inspirations that I wanted to implement in my life or in my children's lives that could help set one up for success. Gladwell does not hold back from his message he wants to convey, rather, he tells it as it is and avoids any mitigation, which he discusses later in the book. The layout of the book is revelatory. Everything links together and leads to an ultimate story, which I shan't revel to save the surprise for potential readers/listeners. I love this book. This writing is very applicable to all. I hope you can use it in your life like I plan to and mine.",2017-02-11

Carmen Lloyd,5,Great narrative,"Great narrative. enjoyed reading the book and then listening to the audio version.  Malcolm Gladwell is an amazing writer and narrator.  His ability to weave the stories and the biographies  of successful  people into  a thoughtful analysis about the elements that will create success or failure  is insightful .   I  will rad this book again because it requires several readings and reflection to truly appreciate the  many themes and information that  Malcolm Gladwell developed and shared  in this  narrative.  I especially enjoyed the   reference to Jamaica and the success and failure of family members born in Jamaica and the elements that supported their growth and achievement.   This is a great book to use with young adults  for reading and discussion as they begin their journey  into adulthood.  This can be a meaningful reminder to all that success is dependent on many factors and that being aware of that will provide the humility to understand that  we are not successful  because  of ourselves alone, but indeed  we owe much to the generation and the ancestors and the time of our birth and on and on.",2016-08-29

Amazon Customer,4,"Insightful, logical, but missing some information","Insightful, logical, but missing some information. This book was very interesting and kept me engaged with insightful stories until the end. There is a pretty significant error in the middle of the book where the author concludes that since Nobel Prize winners are represented by all IQ levels equally above 120, that enabling a larger number of moderately intelligent people into top colleges (all other variables constant) would cause a higher number of intelligent people to produce Nobel worthy accomplishments. This conclusion does not take into consideration the fact that there are a much higher quantities of people with average to marginally above average intelligence than there are brilliant.",2016-01-11

Leonard,5,Will Smith brought me here,"Will Smith brought me here. I initially read this book because of Will Smith. This book started off rough for me because I felt bombarding by stats. I soon began to see that Gladwell was proven his theory. Although, I found the research amazing and valuable I wasn't sure what (I) should do with it. Until the very end where he brings it all full circle and that's my only criticism. I wish the utility of the information given was stated sooner. Still a great book.",2015-12-26

GoodSamaritan,5,Fascinating read with minor flaws,"Fascinating read with minor flaws. I seem to agree with Gladwell with the conclusion he makes. The arguments are sound but they do look to be cherry picked at times. This was probably the main flaw for me, and some people also tend to be highly critical of the book for this reason. It also seems to be repetitive at times. Again, these are only very minor flaws in otherwise excellent book.  But still a very fascinating read and presents alternative perspective. Very easy to read, probably a must read for most people.",2015-12-12

The author takes the common perception of success and analyzes it and comes up with a wholly new conclusion of how to achieve it.

Chivas,3,Overrated,"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable.

Darrell M.,3,Kids: do not be discouraged. Just work hard.,"Kids: do not be discouraged. Just work hard.. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell shows the intriguing correlation between culture (many generations back), opportunity, and chance and the achievement of successful people. The author discusses Scottish herdsmen from the borderlands and the legacy that leaves with the (often mistakenly derided) honor among Southerners. He discusses generations of hard work by Chinese rice farmers and how that, plus basic constructs of their language, profoundly impact the math abilities of Asians today. As an individual, I appreciate more my (Scottish/Irish) tenant farmer heritage and the role that the ethos of hard work played in my own personal success. I also see how my early math geek experiences (mental math competitions) gave me an advantage in engineering school.",2015-08-06

However, as valid as his points are, he leaves out a few very important components that should have been addressed (although he refers to it lightly). The most notable is the individual's desire to succeed or even their acceptance of personal responsibility for their role in their success.

For instance, the location of our schooling and the age cut off dates when we began school might have caused a beneficial trend or the opposite in our life.  These little advantages help to shape our growth within these systems more that we might realize.

When you were born, to whom you were born, where you were born, how hard you work, how your culture molds your values and behavior.  It goes on and on.

Diana,4,"Interesting Info, not the greatest narrator","Interesting Info, not the greatest narrator. The information in the book is fascinating -- it's incredible how much our circumstances determine our successes and how relatively little our so-called ""innate talents"" or ""drive"" do. That being said, I feel that Gladwell could have given more rounded history and perhaps more encouragement to those of us who haven't been doing X activity since age 5. Gladwell also isn't very good at inflecting his voice when he quotes others in the reading, making it difficult on occasion to tell when he's quoting. Towards the end he also gets a bit singsong-y. Overall very worth the listen.",2012-07-20

Malcolm Gladwell tackles the stereotype of the independently successful in his book Outliers. From rags to riches, or riches to rags, each of us are profoundly influenced by our environment. Gladwell argues that there is no such thing as the self made man and that your future is more inherited than earned. His focus is on environmental factors such as date of birth, geography and family heritage. Want to know the best month to be born to become a famous NHL hockey player? What about the right year to become a technology mogul? Gladwell highlights a series of markers that will exert the greatest amount of influence over ones future successes or failures.",2012-05-21

Michael,1,Typical leftist propaganda,"Typical leftist propaganda. I was very interested to hear about the circumstances that lead to great achievement but what I didn't expect was to hear ( at the end of the book during the interview with the author) that this is more about leftist liberal ideology than scientific research. I think this may have been where Barack Obama came up with the statement ""you didn't build that"". I agree that conditions need to be right for people to achieve greatness but I completely disagree with the premise that these individuals weren't special. It's like a seed being planted on good ground or bad ground. If you're a mediocre seed in good ground you won't turn into much but the occasional special seed can become a mighty Redwood. To say that Redwood only became great because it was is the right soil completely ignores the spectacular strength and ability that's part of it's exceptionalism. To ignore that is extremely short-sighted.",2012-05-01

I think every parent/grandparent should definitely listen/read this book and consider the information in it. Even if you don't have the responsibility of influencing the next generation, it is quite something to consider and contemplate how ideas, actions, culture and opportunities have shaped your own life. After reading this, you may even decide to take a new direction from this moment forward. Certainly it will give you a new view of the world and the people in it.",2010-01-23

Ezekiel,5,Thought Provoking and Entertaining,Thought Provoking and Entertaining. Gladwell ferrets out the myths that we would like to be true but always knew weren't that simple.

Particularly interesting to me was the information on intelligence and highly intelligent people.  I love the idea that a certain IQ is ""smart enough"" and beyond does not predict increased success.  I do know at least one person who is Mensa-certifed who was never able to hold a job or attain any level of success.

cosmic nobody,4,great listen for a long drive,"great listen for a long drive. Interesting and provocative, this work has the usual preface to each chapter consisting of a small story- individual or localized situation- and then broadens the perspective of the time, the place, and the mental attitudes of the people involved. The insights on heart disease were particularly interesting, as well as the differing parenting methods and how some kids get lost in the cracks and some excel. Things you know are true, but have a new light shed on them. Every teacher and parent should read this book.",2009-09-09
Anthony A. Ciaccio,4,HARD WORK COUNTS TOO,HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book.  Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221;  My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work.  The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other.  Well how does the author know this?  Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates?  To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control).  Fun book.  I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,2009-08-23
Jonathon Brozny,5,Fantastic book,"Fantastic book. I really enjoyed this book.

Outliers was my first, and it was great! First the content was eye-opening. I enjoyed the stories told and the lessons learned from them. Second, I like to listen to book that are narrated by the author because you can hear the words the way the author intended. Gladwell is a really good narrator. Highly recommended.",2009-08-15

I listened to the Tipping point which was also great but Outliers was much more interesting.     The audio quality was acceptable.",2009-06-30
Teri,5,Very enlightening,"Very enlightening. I read this after reading Talent is Overrated.  Gladwell agrees that a person needs 10,000 hours of practice to be great, and examines the circumstances that allow intensive practice to happen.  It's not all hard work - luck plays a huge role.",2009-06-27
Deborah Coehlo,4,Understanding beyond outliers,"Understanding beyond outliers. Outliers really goes beyond explaining those that excel above everyone else, like Bill Gates and the Beatles. It also explains why some fail, such as pilots and co-pilots following cultural practices rather than safe communication techniques. And, finally it explains how all of us arrive with birth gifts from our past that influence our journey. A great read.",2009-06-26

Wilson,2,The Chicken or the Egg,"The Chicken or the Egg. Life is unfair. Yes, different opportunities face all of us. However, and this is what the book seems to ignore, it is up to the individual to recognize and act. So, I don't believe it is the opportunity that make an outlier, it is the recognition of the opportunities, vision, desire, determination and action that produced the likes of Bill Gates. Keep in mind Bill Gates went to middle school with 300 other kids who all had the same access to the computer. So didn't all 300 have the same opportunity?",2008-12-18

What month you are born,  what year you were born in and early exposure to coaching or technology created many of the giant outliers of today.  Takes some randomness of luck out of many of these individuals personal stories, or at least identifies the underlying events that help create the lucky circumstances for these select individuals.

He knows his material so eel - and it's so interesting - l that it feels like he's telling a good story rather than reading nonfiction. And he's as good a narrator as any - great inflection, perfect pace, fabulous content.  Who could ask for more?!   This book opened my eyes in wonderful ways to what it takes to be successful.

I think listening to this book  would probably  be easier than reading it because of the statistical information.

This is a very well written book that outlines how it's not just the individual who creates his/her own success, but how success is dependent on a number of factors that are completely outside of his/her control.  He emphasizes the need for hard work - 10,000 hours - a message I believe we don't spend enough time advocating to our children today and he raises what I would consider some valid concerns about our public school system that seems to validate what is also advocated by Thomas Friedman in The World is Flat.  What we need now is a book that provides some concrete recommendations that can balance the need to better educate ALL children while still allowing them to have ""free time"" to think, as is urged by professionals like Ned Hallowell, to avoid being ""Crazy Busy"".  The narrator/author has a voice you want to listen to and his personal story at the end should make him more real to you.",2009-02-15
Andrew,5,Incredibly insightful,"Incredibly insightful. Whether you can put what M.G. says into practice for your own gain or not, this book really makes you think differently.  Its tough to argue with the inferences made from the facts he lays out.",2009-02-13
Karla,5,Great Book!,"Great Book!. I usually listen to fiction, but the summary caught my attention and I was intrigued.  I am so glad!  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book and was as enthralled as if listening to a thriller.  It flows well, and I really like the anecdotal supporting stories.",2009-01-24
Brian,5,WOW!!,"WOW!!. LOVED IT!!! very interesting book, i needed it for my statistics class and i thought it was worth reading",2009-01-17
Yonathan,4,very insightful and provocative,"very insightful and provocative. The invocation of Hofstede's theory of social power distribution (PDI) was quite refreshing, and how one's socio-cultural background has so much influence on his/her success on the world stage. Gladwell writes so clear and concise that taking a break from the book was nearly impossible!",2009-01-17
Greg,5,"Good stories, great lessons","Good stories, great lessons. Gladwell uses compelling stories to make a convincing case. On top of it being a well-written, well researched book, he narrates his work effectively and beautifully.",2009-01-04
C,4,Lucid and Entertaining,"Lucid and Entertaining. This and an additional title, Cradle to Cradle, were compelling listening.  This book initially talks about the source of success but the thought provoking information goes much further. Read this for light entertainment or for much deeper reflection - it has the uncanny ability to reach eash of us where we are.",2009-01-02
Shaw,5,Love it,Love it. I love this book; it's a great inside on how little things in life change your future. On how experience make a difference in one's life.,2008-12-23
William,5,"A book of ""WOW!""","A book of ""WOW!"". This book makes me think of the proverb ""The bread not to the wise, the race not to the swift, and the battle not to the warrior for time and chance over take us all.""",2008-12-09
Don,5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful!. Gladwell, once again, reveals the secrets behind the ""obvious.""  The chapter on Korean Air going from dangerous to one of the safest airlines is amazing.  Great work!",2008-11-20
Scott,1,Stupidity goes unanswered,Stupidity goes unanswered. Mr. Gladwell needs to better understand the statistical significance of an outlier (and the definition of multicollinerity). Correlation of independent variables is skewing Gladwell's message and he doesn't even realize it.,2009-08-18

BaconLover,5,Even better that Tipping Point or Blink,"Even better that Tipping Point or Blink. This is an extremely engaging book about how our environment influences who we become. The thesis is unique and contrary to most of the self-improvement books you see out there. Reading this book will certainly give you a new perspective on how you look at industry leaders, athletes, and other outliers in the world. I would encourage anyone who likes Gladwell's other books or similarly data driven books like Freakenomics to listen to this book.",2013-08-19

J. Lee,5,Eye Opening!,"Eye Opening!. It is amazing that most of us think we know the story of success and it's components. In this book, Mr. Gladwell, looking from a different perspective, shines a whole new light on the process.  From hockey to billionaires, His theory posits that it takes more than skill or a genius mind to find the pinnacle of success. Timing and opportunity seem to play a larger role than we may have suspected. As I listened though, the truth seems to be quite clear. It takes a lot of things to line up just right to make a world changing individual. This is a great wake up call for parents, teachers, coaches or anybody else that might be in a position to guide, train or support a young aspirant in any field or endeavor. Are we missing out of 50% of the worlds talent? Listen to this book and decide for yourself. It is time well spent.",2013-06-30

Kejia Wang,5,Great book,Great book. The book has a lot of very inspiring stories on 'outliers'. You can view those successful people from very different angles. I agreed with the author that we often ignored some tiny but important steps of their success.,2013-03-27
Adam,5,"Great book, very informative","Great book, very informative. This was a really good read. Gladwell is a great speaker and the material in this book is eye opening. It lets you in on what was really involved in the making of the ""greats"". The take away for me was that it matters a lot more how you apply yourself then you might think and that you shouldn't just assume that people who are at the top of their field (be it sports or business) are ""naturally gifted"" or anything.",2013-02-08

Roxanne,5,Gladwell reads Gladwell,"Gladwell reads Gladwell. Malcolm Gladwell has a wonderful voice, as well as an interesting mind. While he focuses primarily on men, to my disappointment, Outliers is still worth a listen or two. I still like ""Blink"" best, but will definitely replay this book on my commute. Lots to think about.",2009-02-07
Seda,2,boring book,boring book. I felt like he could say what he wanted to say in half an hour.  The book basically talks about same things over and over.  We know all this.  Nothing new and nothing that will enrich my life.,2009-02-02
