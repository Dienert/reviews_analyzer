"Gladwell is just smart enough.... Gladwells bias towards cultural influence completely skews his ability to see how truly unique many of his ""examples"" are. Like the other Gladwell books I feel as if he is to smart to have missed the obvious fact that these ""examples"" have still accomplished what others who have had similar ""privilege"" have not. Gladwell cherry picks each persons story in an attempt to prove his point while failing to tell each persons whole story. Once again I feel railroaded.",1
"Required Reading for Grad School. This book was interesting, which says a lot when you have to read a book for class. I would read this book in my spare time for pleasure.",1
Five Stars. Great read,1
"his best book yet.... I have to say that I really loved this book, and was sorry to reach the last page. I liked Blink and Tipping Point, but I thought this one made a bigger impact on my thinking about several important subjects. Great observations and insights from a gifted writer make for a great read.",1
Interesting. Worth the read.. This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and it was a good intro. I found the portion about the speech with the pilots to be the most interesting and thought provoking. Will definitely look for more of his work after this.,1
"Another fabulous book by Malcolm Gladwell!. Another fabulous book by Malcolm Gladwell! i didnt' want to put it down, just like his other books! can't wait for the next one",1
"Great Book for a Critical Thinking Class. This is an excellent book to read for leisure reading or for a course on critical thinking. I used this book for a class in critical thinking and analyzing. The great thing about this book is the author discusses his theory as to what an ""Outlier"" is with examples and that unto itself, leads to discussions. Whether or not you agree with Gladwell, you will stop to think about what he has said once you have read the book.",1
"You need to read this book!. Awesome book. A good mix of psychology, real life stories, history, and a feel good read. Finished it cover to cover in 4 days, I couldn’t put it down.",1
This book will completely change the way comprehend success. I can’t take off my outliers goggles of scrutiny,1
"Five Stars. Outliers destroys some standard stereotypes with statidtics, common sense, and occasional flashes of humor. A valuable book.",1
Food for thought. Interesting stories about what makes success (or failure)...and it isn't always what you think.,1
"Intersting, interesting, interesting. Gladwell alwasy provides food for thought. This book is very entertaining and iteresting. I love all the anecdotal evidence althogh he has statistics too. It definately makes you think differently about success. As usual, I'm not sure he got the title right. He seems to not come back around to the idea of outliers very well. I'd title it Hard-earned Success or Lucky Duck.",1
"enlightened. this blew my mind. contains well thought out, well-researched material that really makes a person consider their socioeconomic and social advantages and constraints, as well as the merits of hard work. don't read if you're committed to the idea you are ""self-made""",1
Enjoyed it. Great story teller - read several of his books,1
Very interesting. Very interesting,1
Interesting Insight. I just finished reading this book for book club. The insight as to how outliers became outliers was very interesting.,1
"A question of generalize what is learned. This book is very good and brings a new perspective towards our vision regarding successful people. However, it feels like it is forcing too much its vision because of a intrinsic limitation: it does not have the time or space to analyze every case of success in every area. So the book simply brings us a paradigm that we may believe it and search for ourselves, or not.",1
"Interesting stories about inspiring people. Very good book with interesting principles, unique stories about the backgrounds of those we know and should know",1
"Changes the way you look at success.. Nice to see some scientific research on what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours of practice is the key.",1
Reading. Recommended to me,1
"Great Book - NO DOWNLOAD TIME. I needed this book because my darn professor for got to reserve the book at the library, but he still expects us to read the first three chapters in two days. so thank goodness I had my Kindle and with just a few clicks I had the book. (I'm still watching my other classmates freak out >:D ) but anyways by the time I hit buy and returned to the home menu the book was already there so i was a great buy and very convenient. :)",1
"Compelling thoughts. This book kept my attention the whole way through. It is an interesting study, the idea of success and the perception of that meaning. It is also thought provoking to analyze the contributing factors that are present in each individual story of what might be considered great success. And that those factors span across many demographics and vocations.",1
Very insightful. Excellent read and changed my views on why people perform better than others.,1
A great read.. Malcolm Gladwell is a visionary and sees life through a different lens. Very interesting and compelling book. A great read.,1
"Okay. Okay, nothing special.",1
"A little drawn out !. Very interesting but somewhat repetitive narrative , I suspect the message could have been delivered in a couple of chapters!!",1
"I wish I had read this book years ago. So much insight on how people become successful, I wish I had read this book years ago. Everyone should read this book.",1
"Yet another brilliant work by Gladwell!. I have always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and this one did not disappoint. Gladwell did a thorough analysis on all of the factors that can contribute to one's success that are often overlooked or taken for granted. Besides talent and drive, being in the right place at the right time does matter. We are a product of our environment more so than many would like to admit. Although the concept presented by this book is not new, the detailed analysis conducted by Gladwell provided a thought-provoking insight. I highly recommend this book!",1
Very interesting perspective on success. Dives into the lives of the most successful people's backgrounds and how their opportunities to work hard (rather than just working hard) determined their wild success.,1
"Great Reading!. Interesting perspective of how people achieve to certain levels of their ability. Q unique and interesting perspective. The good is a good read,",1
Bounce now outliers. Another fascinating insight into the story of success. I first read Bounce which roused my curiosity on success and now Outliers further provides evidence that hard work and a great amount of luck can determine future success. As a teacher and sports coach these two books have had a profound affect on my thinking and therefore my work.,1
"A few pearls, but not enough for a necklace. Gladwell lacks rigor (just run a google search for detailed criticism), but this book contains some interesting anecdotes (most memorably the relationship between birth dates and team selection in sports) and one important idea: focused, hard work breeds success.",1
"Typical leftist propaganda. I was very interested to hear about the circumstances that lead to great achievement but what I didn't expect was to hear ( at the end of the book during the interview with the author) that this is more about leftist liberal ideology than scientific research. I think this may have been where Barack Obama came up with the statement ""you didn't build that"". I agree that conditions need to be right for people to achieve greatness but I completely disagree with the premise that these individuals weren't special. It's like a seed being planted on good ground or bad ground. If you're a mediocre seed in good ground you won't turn into much but the occasional special seed can become a mighty Redwood. To say that Redwood only became great because it was is the right soil completely ignores the spectacular strength and ability that's part of it's exceptionalism. To ignore that is extremely short-sighted.",0
"Fascinating book!. I found the stats very fascinating! I am not done with the book yet, but I am excited to see how it ends.",1
Great Book. I could not put this book down. I learned so much on why some people succeed and some don't. Well written and very easy to read.,1
"Kids: do not be discouraged. Just work hard.. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell shows the intriguing correlation between culture (many generations back), opportunity, and chance and the achievement of successful people. The author discusses Scottish herdsmen from the borderlands and the legacy that leaves with the (often mistakenly derided) honor among Southerners. He discusses generations of hard work by Chinese rice farmers and how that, plus basic constructs of their language, profoundly impact the math abilities of Asians today. As an individual, I appreciate more my (Scottish/Irish) tenant farmer heritage and the role that the ethos of hard work played in my own personal success. I also see how my early math geek experiences (mental math competitions) gave me an advantage in engineering school.",1
"Very good read. I appreciate the evidence the author provides, however, I believe he discounts, and even discredits, the hard work and perseverance these individuals put into becoming great. There are millions of people born into opportunistic environments every year in which these people squander opportunity.",1
Excellent reference on opportunities of outliers.. Malcolm does a great job using different successes to describe outliers. It gave me a new perspective on what makes a person or a group of people standout. It is a great book and I would recommend it.,1
"Couldn't put it down. An easy, but thought provoking read. I will never look at US education and arbitrary entry to scholastic and athletic endeavors the same way.",1
Good read would recommend. I bought this book as a group reading for a company that I worked out. It was a good read.,1
Did not meet my expectations. I've expected more from the book based on what people say about it.,1
"A must read!. Eye opening relative revelations about age, demographics, religion, timing and luck as contributors toward success But, the common denominator is hard work. This is a great read, especially if you have young children because a parent can influence their child's success.",1
"Outstanding book. But where do I go from here?. This very thought provoking book helps describe how some famous outliers were able to take advantage of the opportunities timing, culture, and hard work gave them. I read this genre of books to help stimulate ideas to help me rise above my own circumstances, or at least be able to help my own children rise above their own. As historic information the hind sight we can gather from this book doesn't help me recognize future opportunities for myself or my progeny. However, the idea of cultural influence having a significant role over these outliers and how that came about was well worth the price of the book.",1
Five Stars. I would recommend this book!,1
"Do not buy. The book is ripped and dirty, disappointed",0
"Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers. An outlier is one who has reached achievement in a way that was given as only a chance for them to take. Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers, is a captivating written work by involving many real life situations. Not only does it involve Gladwell's own inferences on the success of life, but with the aid of real scenarios that help prove his point. The initial reaction to the word, outlier is not that of Gladwell's. Throughout the book, the meaning of the word outlier to Gladwell, is expressed as people who are those who have been given opportunities, and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. he book is a guideline and proof of how success is reached. The theme guides Gladwell into motivating subject. He starts with the point that professional athletes are where they are at because of when their birthday falls in the year. The ones with birthdays at the beginning of the year have an advantage with size and therefore more practice times and better teams are given to them from the initiation. Gladwell believes that, ""Success is the result of what sociologists like to call accumulative advantage"" (30 Gladwell). With charts of the professional athletes birthdates, he proves his point. ladwell continues the idea by explaining that success is not just handed to individuals. A computer programmer doesn't just already have the knowledge of how to create life long used software from the day they were born. The practice and hard work, is requisite to acquire the skill. From this Gladwell, comes up with the ten thousand hours rule. After questioning many of today's profitable people, one being Bill Gates, Gladwell finds out that all of those people practiced what had made them who they are today for at least ten thousand hours, ""The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything"" (40 Gladwell). his book wasn't just loaded with interesting facts. With encouraging advice the book, provided examples and research of ways that accomplishments can be reached. By starting out in life with the highest IQ, isn't always the lead way to getting ahead. Gladwell talked about studies done on those who started life with the higher intelligence and ended up nowhere. ladwell almost gives a sense of hope for those who are average in intelligence. That is why I recommend this book; because of Gladwell's reasoning that success comes from opportunity, excess of hard work, some start of intelligence not necessarily the highest, and lastly support. ""Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're products of particular places and environments"" (119 Gladwell).  By reading this, it made me enjoy the book, and words from Gladwell. I agreed with his theories at all times. The matters that he had brought up, I had never thought about before. From this it gave me a new view of success and was encouragement for myself to work for it in my own life. With the sense of what it takes for an accomplishment, it makes the reader want to learn more of how to do it and that they aren't as far away from it as they might have thought. For that reason, is why all readers should read this book, because it puts a true meaning on life and where one can lead their own path into the future.",1
"Gladwell produces the best self improvement book that I have read though I am unclear if thats what it is or was written to be. This work offers outstanding perspectives for individuals wishing to unlock the hard path to high achievement or accomplishment ( and its not even assured!) Outliers is arguably the best modern gestault works drawing its resources from sociology, pyschology, anthropology, all the -ologies are covered as Gladwell's scope is wide in subject but his talent is the ability to focus the reader within that wide range of very well documented observations to understand and benefit from from Gladwell's out of sight insights.",1
"Another Malcolm Gladwell success story!. ""Outliers - the story of success"" is worth your while! This is what a popular discussion of science (in the sociology/psychology field) should be like. It is entertaining, as well as challenging conventional wisdom. Well written, and energetically read by the author himself. I especially enjoyed the references to the work of the Dutch researcher Hofstede on culture.",1
Vyicvycyk. Gghj,0
"Not scientific yet thought provoking. Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good ""airplane books"", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day. Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.",1
Very Interesting Read. I think this one of the most interesting book I have ever read. It has very good examples for the advice that is given. The success stories are very interesting as well. I recommend for anyone who wants to be an expert or virtuoso or even just a parent who wants there child to be a success.,1
"Paul Harvey on steroids. If you enjoyed Paul Harvey and the rest of the story, then you will like this. The author finds obscure people and situations then tells the rest of the story. However, when the author goes off on philosophical curiosities, then the story is destroyed. He copies the hockey story from Freakonomics and doesn't give credit. As far as me the reader/listener, I can draw my own curiosities. Thanks Gladwell for some good stories. Perfect for my boring commute.",1
"Was There a Point to Outliers?. The disappointing and monotonous book, Outliers, did not deserve to be on the Top Seller's List, at least in my mind. The repetitive style of writing that Malcolm Gadwell chose to use ended up losing its impact within the first three chapters. His outdated examples and confusing thought process turned the somewhat interested youth away. he story starts out with a little spunk and a new way of looking at something. An open mind is necessary because buying into his thoughts is key to enjoying the message. The challenge of keeping an open mind served to be a good lesson for future readings, and necessary to liking his book. The beginning is intriguing and leaves you with the feeling of wanting more. All of his evidence is backed up with solid sources and further validates his point, but this interesting style of writing doesn't last for long. s the story goes on Gladwell continues to say the same facts over and over, and doesn't satisfy the reader's feeling of wanting more. For example in the beginning of the story Gladwell touches on the fact that opportunities and time of birth are essential to success. There is a long and satisfying chapter about this subject in the beginning. Just when you thought a new idea would be introduced you keep getting hit with the same idea. Gladwell mentions opportunities and time of birth in almost every chapter. He not only shows how it helped this person, but goes on to explain it yet again. nlike most stories there was no conclusion to his ideas. Gladwell did not organize his thoughts; furthermore, resulting in a confusing book. By not keeping his readers interested Gladwell failed to communicate the message that he was trying to send. Gladwell needed to be more convincing, brief and interesting in order to pull in his readers.",0
"Subjective conclusion of success... I like books and bios from and about successful people much more. While I enjoyed many of the point of views, the why I see is that the author’s conclusion of success just as dangerous as the $50 million earning of some corporate CEOs’",0
"Such a great book. It is a great book, fun to read but at the same time so eye opening, i recomend this book to everyone but mostly to young people who realy need to understand what a success is and how some one becomes an outlier",1
Account for the details overlooked!. This book elaborates on the what and how the roads to success are paved out by external factors.,1
"Best Of Best. This book is reallly amazing. I loved it. In this boook malcolam gladwell explains the clear difference between the sucessful people and non sucessful people. It also explains that behind sucessful people there are mamy more people that helped them, and also they have many other advantages.",1
"Engaging but doubtful. A compelling argument, however a potentially misleading one. The book is heavily based on anecdotal evidence, with barely no statistical data to confirm we are actually seeing causation rather than random coincidence.",1
Outliers. Great book for anyone who loves to see accepted paradigms shattered. Well written with very interesting examples. The biggest surprise is the epilogue!,1
"Great information, but missing all-important prescriptive sections. Malcolm Gladwell manages to turn research books into stories that are engaging and exciting. It's a real gift. In ""Outliers,"" Gladwell supposes that there's no innate ""talent"" gene; that the Bill Gates' and Wayne Gretzkys and Robert Oppenheimers of the world are at least as much the beneficiaries of chance as they are of some talent that is so far beyond the rest of humanity. What's surprising is the deluge of research Gladwell trots out to support these assertions.",1
Five Stars. I read just ywo chapters I started loving this book already.,1
Five Stars. Great book with lots of information. I would highly recommend.,1
Another point of view. A great book that opens your mind up to a different way of thinking.,1
Five Stars. Fascinating look at success and the myth of the self made person.,1
surprising underlying information on success. very interesting findings brought in a way that evokes the quest-ions in the reader wonder-fully.,1
Five Stars. Great stories within the book!,1
"Great for Book Club Discussion. Malcolm Gladwell uses lots of memorable stories in his well-written book debunking what we think about ""success."" Whether you believe he's made his case or not, you can't argue with the facts he presents, only his interpretation of them. It will make for a great book club discussion!",1
Five Stars. Quick delivery and a great book to read.,1
"Okay. I honestly have not finished this book. I just could not get into it. The concepts are interesting enough but if you are looking for a read with some sort of story line this definitely is not the book. When I have more time on my hands i will give it another go. however, there is no rush to do so.",1
"Makes you think. This book certainly makes you think and is enjoyable to read. It can open up a new way of evaluating how we look at successful people and how opportunity and circumstances shape our own lives. While some may argue that the book leaves success up to chance, I believe the author shows that it takes the combination of giftedness, work ethic, and the ability to take advantage of unique and incredible opportunities to be successful.",1
"Incredible. I loved this book! Not only is it a joy to listen to Malcolm Gladwell but the subject matter is incredibly interesting and well thought out. I was surprised by this book. I knew that the story of success wasn’t a story of the individual, but of the circumstances that helped the individual get to where s/he was, but I didn’t realize how much culture came into play. Really extraordinary. I’m a new big fan!",1
"Eye opening, an excellent book!. This book really brings out the meaning in some very interestimg statistics that you really wouldn't think we're related.",1
Great book written by a great author. The book provides a detailed review of success and the lives of many successful people in modern history. It is an eye opening book. You enjoy ready this extremely well-written book and you learn a lot too.,1
"More people should read this book.. More people should read this book. Instead of glorifying ""get rich quick"", more people should realize that success the the result of not only circumstance but of old fashion HARD WORK.",1
Five Stars. Great,1
Great read!. Great read!,1
"Second Time I bought this book !!. This is the Second time I have bought this book. The first book was borrowed from me before I even finished it..... it made its way thru the family and now is being passed around to friends. ""Outliers"" is marvelous, and I can well understand why it has stayed on the best seller list for so long. This book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell, and now I look for everything he writes. I will start reading this again, from the beginning, and with any luck will be able to finish it before someone borrows this copy, too !!",1
Humbling and Inspiring. Another great book from Gladwell. This book has a nice mix of explaining how outliers come to be and challenging readers to look for the opportunities they and others around them are presented to succeed.,1
"Amazing book.. Interesting story line of book. Nothing is only driven by luck and talent, but also and mainly by hard work and preparation.",1
"Interesting but I disagree.. The books provides a lot Marco and Micro examples of how circumstances produce “outliers” (great ppl). I agree whole heartily that is part of what makes anyone great is the family, opportunities, culture, community they grew up in. We all stand the shoulders of giants. But we also choose to work har and take risks where many could have but chose not to. I believe being self made is a choice someone makes, but their is a lot luck with no fault of your which allows you to choose to be self made. For example have a stable home, going to a good school, having a good mentor etc.",1
Interesting. Interesting book with many interesting stories and points to contemplate. Very much looking forward to reading more books by Mr. Gladwell.,1
Not what I expected. I had seen this title recommended by a few sources and thought I should give it a try.,1
"Another journalist behaving badly, pretending to be an expert. My friend recommended this to me. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. This guy is a journalistic, providing insights and observations on things about which he has no real expertise. Look up The Igon Value Problem.... This quote says it all... [W]hen a writer’s education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong (Steven Pinker).",0
Okay for a Used Book. It looks okay for a used book. There is no writing and highlighting. There is a small bend in the binding but it is a great used book.,1
Surprising and Astounding. Loved it. It gives analysis on the factors associated with success. This was my first audiobook,1
"Incredible. This book is eye opening, to say the least. The way he makes sense of so many things is just incredible.",1
"Four Stars. I am really enjoying reading it at the moment, very interesting. Worth buying.",1
Four Stars. Read this in college and loved it so got a copy for my son. Great read.,1
Life Reflection. Excellent dialogue that encourages an understanding of success for the average man or woman. Loved it!,1
Success. Good book to read for success,1
Five Stars. Very interesting.,1
Great listen. A great listen. It takes you on a journey of understanding into the stories behind how many well known people succeeded. Very interesting and sure to provide some enlightening conversations about the stories. Covers things from air crashes to ice hockey and maths in between. Highly recommend.,1
"Gladwell Again Connects the Most Remote Dots to Chart the Extraordinary Success of a Chosen Few. Both a keen eye for shrewd observation and a sure grasp on historical evidence serve author Malcolm Gladwell fruitfully in this fascinating look at people who appeared at first to be ""outliers"" compared to mainstream society only to find themselves at the pinnacle of their fields through a symbiotic combination of talent, vision and intelligence. What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart. Gladwell has already proven to be masterful at identifying social phenomena that no one else has discerned quite as lucidly, such as the source of fads and cultural changes in",1
It didn’t seem like I was going to be as interested as I .... Have you ever wondered what takes to become the “World’s Greatest” at something? What it takes to go from rags to riches? How much talent or determination you need?,1
Excellent Read; Great length for a Plane Ride!. This is a very interesting and thought-provoking book. It is the perfect length to where you can finish it in a few days or long flight.,1
The book was way more interesting than I originall. I rather enjoyed the book. I found it to be intriguing how the lives of others were changed by circumstances.,1
Great information. I use this book as the basis for a course I facilitate. The writing and real examples make the theories accessible to participants. I will never fly on an Asian airline.,1
"Excellent book. Outliers is an intriguing book of ten distinct stories of how more than just intelligence and hardwork helped people to become outliers in their professions. The book explores the backgrounds of athletes, software developers, and lawyers plus many more. It is a great read and a great gift for others.",1
Five Stars. Good book. Let me know success is not a thing only because the successful person is smart.,1
"Teacherdeb. A new perspective on success. Gives the reader something to think about, but take into perspective. I found it very interesting.",1
Very good thought provoking read. Like his other books Malcolm Gladwell provides great thought provoking stuff! I have enjoyed the Tipping Point and Blink and this was just as good.,1
Four Stars. Just what was expected,1
Nice book. for my college course,1
"New Way to think about things. Worth the pick. I did enjoy learning to see things through a different light. At the end of the day, achievement and success might not be as far fetched as it is made out to be.",1
"Outstanding!. Malcom Gladwell does another fine job of storytelling while informing the reader of things they likely hadn't considered. It drives a stake through the heart of the American fantasy of ""I made it all on my own"" - ""I'm a self-made person"".",1
Great read!. Fabulous book and one of my All-time favorites.,1
"Great book. Great book, easy to read, REALLY interesting. Bought this because I saw Gladwell's TED ""David and Goliath"" talk and decided to start out with this book before reading that one. It is very interesting and very easy to read, although there is an issue with the side notes and the e-version, so that detracted from the experience, but that's Amazon's fault, not the authors.",1
"I highly recommend the book to everyone. Malcolm answered a question that I always wondered about on how other people seemed lucky and appeared to have everything working for them. He had an ingenious way to tell his family story throughout this book, which made me more appreciative of reading the OUTLIERS and getting to know who is Malcolm.",1
great read. this is my second book and I have to say I'm hooked great while working,1
Read it!. It's a really good book. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. You'd be surprised of the things you learn.,1
"Five Stars. Amazing book to read! I enjoyed it. Malcolm is one of the best authors, he always comes with these intriguing ideas and surprising findings that a reader couldn't expect.",1
Great Read!. The book is great and contains a wide plethora of interesting stories and concepts. I enjoyed reading it. It truly placed some common notions under scrutiny and challenged the assumption that high IQ equals success. This is a must-read for any Malcolm Gladwell fans or for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the world around them.,1
"Two Stars. easy to read, VERY overrated",0
Five Stars. Inspirational.,1
If you are a Gladwell fan...... You myst pick this one up. By far my favorite of all Gladwell's books!,1
"Excellent. Not what you might expect!. Great to hear a book read by its author, especially when the author is such a good communicator.",1
"Simply Amazing!. Is truly a great book and one that you really need to read if you're starting your career and want to be successful. It helps you embrace your ethnicity, cultural background and other personal ""baggage"" and realize the good and the bad of the hand you got dealt. The best part is that gaining that awareness will help you create a plan to compensate or potentialize these subtleties of your own history.",1
"Easy, gripping read. The author is supremely talented at telling stories related to his thesis, linking them together, and calling back to them to strengthen his suppositions. This doesn't appear to be ""research-based"" in the strictest sense of the term but it will get you thinking.",1
Five Stars. A book everyone should read......very interesting.,1
Outliers. The book was delivered in excellent condition - like new and was delivered before the promised date. Cannot ask for more than that!!,1
"Perspective Changing. This book changed my way of perceiving the achievent of sucess and how talent is less important than we think for reaching it. Gladwell picked great and interesting examples to prove his argument. It's a delightful book and I'll surely recommend it to my friends, especially for the ones who are about to be parents. ""The 10000 hours rule"" made me think how important pratice and nurturing is important when you are raising your kid.",1
"Outliers. Very interesting reading, lost air in the last chapter. Good airplane book, well written",1
Thought-provoking look at success.. Highly effective thesis about the many factors that create the uber successful person. Read it.,1
"He needs to also review motivations to succeed. Excellent book with lots to think about. However, I often thought while reading that he is not considering the influence of personal motivation which may also be effecting individual's success",1
Interest overview of successful people. I love Malcolm Gladwell way of putting basic concepts and aspects of life in a very interesting and different perspective,1
Five Stars. Needed this for my son's schoolwork. He said that it was an interesting book.,1
"An ok book. I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring? Not to me.",1
"one great read. At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller. The author also flatters and draws in the reader with well chosen examples.",1
"Transformational. Cutting edge. A must read. That said, this book has been so quoted in the last few years, that it seems positively mainstream. Nevertheless, seminal books have genius in them, and I think that this is one of those.",1
Five Stars. a1,1
"Brilliant. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwells 'revisionist history' podcast I decided to give outliers a go, and it didn't disappoint, I can't recommend it highly enough",1
"Well written by shallow - par for the course for Gladwell. I love him as a writer of magazine articles, he is funny, concise, and even enlightening. He is a great interview. But, as a writer of full length books, he is horribly shallow and delves into a subject about as lightly as possible. At least this book was not mind numbingly dumb like 'Tipping Point'. There was some interesting stuff here (though that might simply have to do with my own ignorance on the subject).",1

"Beautifully Written. Makes one think about life differently and in effect, challenges the long held narrative that doing well i.e. winning in life is just a product of an individual's hard work . Outliers reminds us that culture, lineage, timing, and luck all factor into whether success is an outcome.",1
"GREAT REVELATIONS!. How did I get along without this provocative information? I don't know, but I'm glad to have had the opportunity for enlightenment. A wonderful book about the confluence of coincidence, birthdates intellect, luck, and drive on the outcome of accomplishments in a given range of time and place. Too good to pass up.",1
"quick read. great insights. will change your life. i still make references to its 10,000 hours theory frequently. probably gladwell's best book and i have read tipping point, blink, and the one w the short stories. it's a quick read. well written and fun to read.",1
"Changing the way the world understands itself, one person at a time.. Malcolm Gladwell has something important to say. He makes an elegant case, employs agreeable logic, and is a colorful story-teller. Even if you disagree with his primary arguments, you will surely enjoy the craft of his artisans' prose, and learn something new.",1
Thought provoking. analysis fascinating,1
"fantastic book, well written. fantastic book, well written, unbiased, full of interesting facts and information. enjoyable read. not sure what i got out of it, but it was interesting read, nonetheless.",1
Amazingly Informative. I was drawn to Malcolm Gladwell because of his Masterclass on writing. I enjoyed the class and thought I would certainly enjoy his writings. I was not disappointed. This book about success taught me so much about opportunity and culture and how those two things impact the success of many.,1
I really like the book and it definitely makes you think. I got this book for my English 101 class and decide to read a little bit before and I dont wanna put it down! I really like the book and it definitely makes you think.,1
Five Stars. Gave as a present,1
Five Stars. It is a really good glad I bought it,1
"A Book EVERYONE Must Read. Every fourth grader through and including every adult will gain great insights of what is possible within each of us. Circumstances play a huge role in success, but so does a culture of hard work and discipline. This is a must read book.",1
"Gladwell is king. Entertaining and well written, some of the conclusions made in the book are somewhat simplistic, entertaining nonetheless.",1
"Great and informative read when focused. I really liked this book. It took me a few months to read because I didn't find it as gripping as other writings, so I would often read a couple of books and come back to it. I challenged myself to focus over the last week and I'm so glad that I did. This was a wonderful book and it has opened my eyes to a better way of thinking about success.",1
"Parent or Not to Parent. Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself. In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount. One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself. Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately. I agree with the premise of the book to a point. While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors. By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",1
Great condition. The book came in perfect condition and honestly really fast to it’s a very interesting book and I learned a lot of thinks from this book psychology all thought mind is a little messed up because I’ve read it already.,1
"Ok. I thought it was a good book, but there was a lot of information that basically tells you to work hard and you'll be successful....Duh",1
debunks myths with hard data and human stories. Well written and presents a good case as to why really successful people achieve like they do/did. Draws a number of good analogies as well as very literal interpretations of raw data.,1
Four Stars. Very good read used it for a organizational behavior class in grad school.,1
"Great stories. Interesting stories on a range of subjects from airline pilots to computer geeks, to the history of jamica. All shows how a lucky handful get to be successful.  was hoping there would be some useful tips but the moral of the story seems to be you have to be in the right place at the right time.",1
wow. awesome book...well written...excellently researched...wow.,1
Factual and Inspiring. I don't fully agree with the .... Factual and Inspiring. I don't fully agree with the hockey analysis. There are so many hockey greats born after May/ June timeframe.,1
"Fascinating. I found this book to be fascinating and it made me think, and ultimately change my philosophy of the relationship of brilliance to success. Using a variety of subjects, Gladwell poses his theories relative to the opportunities presented, hours experienced and mental capabilities of some of our well known success stories. I found out some things I didn't know and came to understand some things that I knew - but had never assembled and reviewed in this manner. I love books about ""people"" - their experiences, attempts, failures and successes - so I found this book very interesting and have purchased multiple copies for my friends and acquaintances - such as this one. You may be challenged and you may not agree with all of Gladwell's conclusions - I didn't - but I think you would be hard pressed to read this book without smiling occasionly saying, ""I never knew that"" and perhaps even changing the way you look at and approach success in life.",1
Awesome Book... Good collection of researches and facts on success is given very nicely in the book. This book will make you realize that you don't have to be genius to become successful.,1
Love Gladwell!. Love all Gladwell,1
Five Stars. Terrific story; It made me think differently at the word today.,1
great. amazing book,1
10.000 hours.... I'm still in shock to realize that I've used 10.000 hours in something I didn't want to!! There's a lesson in every story that Mr. Gladwell shares and if you are a parent trying to define success for your child this is the book to have: you'll learn that it depends on many factors being you (the parent) a key factor!,1
Fantastic book. I loved it. The way he shows how circumstances shaped the lives of succeeded people is amazing.,1
Best book I've ever listened to.. I wish I would've read this book 15 years ago. Gave me a new motivation to raise my kids differently than I was raised.  Couldn't stop listening. Finished it in one day.,1
"and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I .... This book has fundamentally altered the course of my existence. I will remember this book and reference it whenever I can. I was forced to read it for class, and it turned into the greatest blessing. Out of all of the books I have read in my entire life this book has been the most inspiring. Many of the things in here are common sense. It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few. Greatness is in fact the reward of those who work hard. I read this book at exactly the right time in my life and would suggest it to anyone. I am an avid reader, but I have never enjoyed books presented to me in school until this book!",1
Fascinating. A provocative look at success and how the most successful people in history rose to notoriety!,1
Eye Opener. This book really opened my eyes to how success is really had by the lucky few. Well written and easy to understand. Anyone can read this and come away with a new understanding of the world we live in. This book needs to be read by all so that we may change the way we encourage and discourage success. I am enriched by reading this book and look forward to reading more by Gladwell.,1
Love it. Wonderful book!. Very complete and full of info. Can't beat it!,1
"A quick read following up the work in Blink. A great read, who's central idea is that the factors behind bigtime success are more than an individual's own work. Whereas Blink shows us that 10,000 hours of hard work are necessary to be considered awesome at something, this book goes into the factors that lead to someone being able to get those hours.<br /><br />It isn't based on the best evidence, though. Usually, we need statistics to explain things like this, and though I'm sure he has a fair amount of research that proves his point (or provides evidence for it), the majority of the explanations are through anecdote.",1
Five Stars. Great Book,1
Awesome book I couldn't put it down!. I devoured this on the beach.,1
gift. I gave this to my daughter for christmas and she told me that she wanted her husband to read it so she would have someone to discuss the book with her. She loved it! I told her to pass it on to me when they're done. Sounded good to me.,1
Insightful!. The book is a quick read backed by lively and relevant research and examples. Well written and a recommended read.,1
"Great Read - Helps Us Realize We Have Much To Learn. This is a great exercise in taking a handful of topics to illustrate how reality varies greatly from common paradigms. It helped me realize that many of the decisions made by individuals and institutions are based on incomplete or faulty perceptions of what is really happening. It is also humbling to recognize that much of success is better explained by chance or circumstance than by the illusion of the ""self made man"". All of this is written in a style easy to read. I've recommended this book to many friends. You might also enjoy ""You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself"" by David McRaney (Oct 27, 2011)",1
"Fantastic. This has to be one of the best books I have read. The author made me look at my life and that of others with a different viewpoint. I no longer beat myself about things I haven't achieved in life, I now recognise that the timing was wrong and that when it is right I must be ready and have the desire to achieve whatever it is.",1
Five Stars. You are where you come from...,1
Broadening the perspective of what it takes to be successful.. Gladwell's takes our crude and narrow idea of what it takes to be successful and expands our field of vision.,1
Five Stars. my husband loved it!,1
"Best book ever written. Period. I can honestly say, this book has changed my entire outlook on life for the better. Really understanding that there is more to life than we think, can really humble you, and motivate you at the exact same time. That is exactly what this book will do for you. Malcom Gladwell can do no wrong. Amazing!!!",1
"Intriguing Insight. Captivating scenarios- obviously immaculately researched. While time invested is a commanding observation, Forrest Gump may have summarized all with chocolate.",1
"Entertaining and fun, but not compelling. Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style. His writing is beautiful. The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",1
"Good read. Throws into perspective the life you lived. You could be angry what you could have had or be happy what you had. I'm truly grateful for my shortcomings, I use to believe that my disparities resulted in my success, but It was because of my disparities I am here. Thank you",1
Four Stars. Very good book.,1
👍. 👍,1
"Interesting Theory. I am glad that I read this book, but I did feel it was too repetitious.",1
"Who Knew?!. This a great book! If you ever wanted a working theory on how to be successful, or how those you admired became successful, this is the book to read. Very thought provoking, convincing, creative and entertaining!",1
"Outliers. Great book I've gotta say. If you're looking to nerd out on how successful people get to where they are this is for you. From Bill Gates to pilots to seemingly everything the author has boiled success down to a science and uses seemingly odd details such as birthplace, month of birth, and ancestral background to explain a persons potential for success and how under the right circumstances these favored persons become the greats that we dream of becoming. Very informative.",1
Three Stars. An interesting subject and thesis that could be explored further and more case studies should have been included.,1
Good Read. If you're a thinker like me you'll like this book as well as his other work.,1
Very Enlightening. I was enthralled from the start. This is the 3rd book of Gladwell's that I've heard and probably my favorite. It gave me a greater sense of how success is really achieved and what I might do to enhance my chances of success and that of my children.,1
One of the best books I’ve read to date.. After reading this book it will be imposible not to consider it in my daily decisions.,1
"Outliers Malcolm Gladwell. Easy to read, logical and clear evidence of aspects that drive success. Whilst a lot of the things are not controllable understanding then is invaluable.",1
"You need to read this book!. Awesome book. A good mix of psychology, real life stories, history, and a feel good read. Finished it cover to cover in 4 days, I couldn’t put it down.",1
Five Stars. Great book for knowledge,1
Great book to make you think. When you read this book you will realize that success is not just working hard but a series of situations that Foster success. Very interesting perspective on a lot of different things.,1
"Finally, a book I liked from Malcolm Gladwell. Success isn't coincidental; it's a matter of context. Outliers don't become outliers due to their skills, but to the way (and date) they've been born, the way circumstances led them to success, their culture, their network, their family, and luck.",1
Great!. Great,1
A great introspective narrative. a good reveal on how the pieces on a tilted chessboard obtained their ranked entitlements.,1
Neat point of view! It really spoke to me .... Neat point of view! It really spoke to me and how I need to look at all the little details of situations and create outliers in my classroom.,1
Definitely recommended. Fantastic book on sociology that dives deep on a number of influences on success and unusual occurances.,1
"Seems anecdotal in nature, but don't be fooled, there is a theme there. Reading Malcolm Gladwell is like watching the PBS series ""Connections"". In both cases, the author (and the narrator) brings up several interesting but initially unconnected historical stories, and then ties them altogether at the end to show the advancement of a science or an ideology. Very interesting.",1
"Smart Book. Well read. Very thought provoking. There are alot of lists in this book - which would be easier to skim in a ""real"" book - a bit tedious to hear them read outloud. But it includes lots of great stories and characters.",1
Five Stars. Great book. Discusses successful people and the affect their family and opportunities helps them along the way.,1
"Necessary Read!. Malcolm Gladwell gives perfect insight into how talent, access to opportunity, and attitude, may come together to define success. Drilling down to how birth month can impact success was a great epiphany for me.",1
"Good Stuff. It's no secret that Gladwell's books are fascinating and full of great insight. I really wanted to get it but at an affordable price. Thanks to Amazon, I got my wish. This is a great read and I received it in great condition. I definitely recommend reading ""Outliers"" and ordering it on Amazon.",1
"should not have put it off so long. I had resisted this book for a long time, having some difficulty with the premises as represented in reviews and critiques. When i finally listened, I was floored. This is an incredible book that will challenge your preconceptions. There is no higher praise to be given.",1
Every educator needs to read this!!. Teachers. You matter.  Read this book to find out why!!! Outliers are not born they are made,1
"Inciteful, Interesting, and Compelling Read. Malcom Gladwell returned with another stellar read. Not only was this book filled with facts, it was interesting and well written. I was engaged and curious until the last pages.",1
Nice book. Different perception. Nice book. Different perception. Some of the examples are amazing. Was worth my time.,1
"Paradigm Shifter. This is a book that makes one reevaluate one's assumptions about personal success.The authors skill in pulling apparently extraneous examples into a powerful whole and a truly moving ending provides an extrordinary reading experience.Upon completing the reading of this book, I immediatly ordered the author's two other books.",1
"Absolutely fascinating!. This book was an eye opener. I assure you that it will open your mind to ideas you probably never even considered, and they are explained in a way that makes them so compelling and easy to grasp. Highly recommend it.",1
The title is the best part. I was disappointed with this book and considering stopping a few pages into it and returning the darn thing.,0
Excellent read. Great book!,1
The Edge of Knowledge. Malcom Gladwell's book is full of unheard knowledge behind such success stories of many people who we've come to admire over the years. To understand the why's and how's of what it took for these folks achieve their success is without a doubt riveting. It truly is a masterpiece!,1
Spot On. Gladwell reiterates what we know already. In such an eloquent manner! Intelligence paired with the right resources gets you to where you need to be. To be that outlier who gets the world’s attention,1
Five Stars. Nice book,1
"Outliers. Not just a book, thought provoking and challenging especially if you have kids! What opportunities are you creating for them and what plays to their advantage naturally due to the factors discussed in the book? There are doubters out there who disagree with some of the concepts which is understandable, that's what the book is meant to do - make you question!",1
Great read for an athlete. Very well written book to give any athlete.,1
loved everything about it.. it's especially great that the author himself is the one who is reading. the story was great. it was just fantastic. loved it. 6 stars if I could.,1
Love the book. I found it very interesting a must read to comprehend the factors involved in the making of successful people and products.,1
"insights into success. This book explores how timing, opportunity, and effort contribute to the successes that people enjoy. It takes a lot of time and effort to become the master of an ability. Opportunity must alight with ability for a person to become a success. There are sometimes small windows of opportunity into which someone is thrust that creates the possibility of a person or group to reap the success of ""having the stars align"" . This is a great read.",1
very well done!. very well done. hard to stop once you start. very informative. great job. highly recommend,1
Five Stars. Great book,1
"Good Value. Ship Faster and the book looks like a new. Just cover edge little bit bent, inside was good. Good value",1
"Modern, Insightful Analysis. Wonderful analysis and thoughtful, up-to-date discussion regarding talent development and its implications. This time, I need eight more words, words.",1
Fantastic!. Such a mind opening book. Amazing lessons to take away and apply. Malcom Gladwell is just a fantastic writer!,1
"A young person's guide for Success. An interesting variety of short stories about many successful people's lives from which young people, who are serious about being great, can gain insight and purpose.",1
So good. Best one yet,1
Another solid book by Gladwell. Gladwell is an amazing writer. I wish he'd publish something every six months.,1
great book with a lot of great information. while the story provides a great amount of information I feel that at times Gladwell dives a little more into the back story than needs he needs to.,1
"A must. Love Malcom Gladwell books , very easy to read",1
awesome book. Loved it. I recommend it as a must read. Gladwell's unorthodox thinking sheds light on many issues.,1
Mind-blowing purchase. An absolute gem of a book. The perfect book to read in your early 20's.,1
For all self-made Successes. Hard work and perseverance bear fruit but don’t fool yourself into thinking that its enough and that it entitles you to scorn those at a lower level. We have a lot to learn......,1
Four Stars. Ver interesting read,1
Very Interesting. It was easy to listen to. I had never heard anything like it and found it to be very interesting.,1
Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric .... Marvelous piece of writing by Mr. Gladwell. Esoteric without being too learned for laymen to follow and grasp the concepts. I felt wiser having read this over a period of a few days.,1
Very satisfying!. This was my first book to read from Malcolm Gladwell. I finished it months ago and I am still thinking about the information as well as talking about the book to really anyone who will listen. Wonderful.,1
Fantastic Book. Very interesting book about the most famous and wealthy people and how they got to be that way. The author has great stories with awesome characters that are very memorable. I would recommend this book to anyone and have loaned it out to my girl friend and Dad and they both loved it.,1
"An interesting look at the meaning of success. Mr. Gladwell, I am currently a senior at Hatboro-Horsham High School, and am in Senior English. In Senior English, as in all English classes, we have a central question that all our units and lessons revolve around that structures what we should be taking away from the course. In Senior English, our question is: to what extent do time and place define a person? Your book, Outliers, is the first book we read in the class, and you can probably guess as to why your book was chosen to fit in with our curriculum. Your book perfectly demonstrated how time and place can affect, and in some cases, completely determine the success of an individual. One of my favorite chapters was the one about the 10,000 hour rule. I liked that you pointed out that talent doesn't come to anyone without putting in a large amount of work in. Growing up I was involved in many activities, but I never stuck with any of them because I saw other kids who were better at them than I was and I assumed talent at a particular skill was something a person is either born with or not. It never occurred to me that maybe those kids invested more time into their skill than I did. It was also pretty amazing to learn that even people like Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and The Beatles had to put in 10,000 hours before they were able to be at the top of their field. Another chapter I enjoyed was the one about the Matthew effect. It was interesting to learn how the date of birth of an athlete can affect his or her chances of doing well in his or her sport and making it to a professional league. I feel bad for the hockey players that could have been good if only they had been given a little extra time to grow and develop, like the players whose birthdays fell right after the cutoff date. The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy is very interesting; that something false can evoke a behavior that makes the falsehood seem true. I can relate to this chapter because the cutoff for kindergarten in my school district is early September, and I was born in late August. I am usually the youngest in my class, and one of the youngest in my grade. Sometimes I was not as quick in school because my brain was not as developed as the kids in my grade who were born in September or October. I also liked the chapter about the Asian rice paddies. There has always been the stigma that Asians are better at math, but I never knew where the stigma came from. This chapter pointed out that Asians' talent for math comes from their culture with rice paddies. I liked this chapter, along with others, that demonstrated that a person's cultural background can influence their success. The idea that who your ancestors are can determine if you achieve a lot or a little is fascinating. Outliers was an interesting book to read, and it made me think about what the true meaning of success was, and by what means people reached success. I enjoyed the book, and I think it added a lot to our English curriculum. Sincerely, Michelle Lineberger",1
One of the best. Very in-depth research delivered in a fascinating descriptive style of story telling. Thank you.,1
"A different way of thinking. Gladwell has made quite a name for himself with this book and his thoughts. The main message is clear, there are extenuating circumstances in ever outcome in life. He looks at how the month you were born in really affects your ability to play top notch hockey (it makes a big difference), That in and of itself may not be a big issue for you, but, by inference it may influence when you try to have children and the impact on them scholastically. I don't generally read non-fiction. This is well written and made me sit back and think about a lot of things.",1
"I personally learned a lot from the book, I've never thought of. I personally learned a lot from the book, I've never thought of success in  such a complex way before. It kinda made a lot of success stories i didn't understand, understandable. When looking at a successful person, the first thought you think is &amp;lsquo;This person is lucky&amp;rsquo;. Really, success has many different causes, and some causes a person just can&amp;rsquo;t apply to their own life. Some of these causes are birth place/time and opportunity. The random causes of life can make or break the opportunities you have. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of this study before reading the book and it made me think of all the successful people I know and why they might be successful. The book makes me look at the external factors of that person&amp;rsquo;s success first. It makes you feel bad about judging the people with the &amp;lsquo;Lucky&amp;rsquo; title because you don&amp;rsquo;t know what causes they might have had.",1
"Best book I've read in a long time. For a non-fiction book, this was entertaining like no other! Gladwell defines success as a coming together of as much opportunity as hardwork, instead of being defined by the genius of an individual. It was hard not to think about myself and people I know as I read it, and it humbled me many times and also infuriated me many other times. There might be some over generalizations based on the examples given in the book, but it never strayed from its overall ethos in my opinion.",1
"This is an amazing, and very interesting book. I had to read it. This is an amazing, and very interesting book. I had to read it for one of my college classes, and I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised, and everyone I've met who's read this book is impressed. It's worth reading. :)",1
"Very interesting and thought provoking book. I liked that it went behind the curtain as it were of ""success"" stories and looked at the many fascinating things that contribute to that. The stories that illustrate were particularly useful and illuminating. Or more precisely the outlier stories. As they were not all about success. A case in point being the Korean airlines bad safely record in the 90's as an outlier.",1
"Well put together. Enticing story telling, captivating narration, interesting topics, often fascinating way of looking at common statistics available for all to grasp. So this is how the world works?!",1
"One of the worst books I have ever read. Very superficial, full of misleading facts the book is packed with fallacies. I do not recommend it to anyone",0
The parallels of success found in society to society. I’ve never read a book as clear and succinct as Outliers. Every assumption is backed with facts and the writer comes across as a journalist/lawyer.,1
"He loved it.. I read this book several years ago, but purchased for my husband. He loved it.",1
"I enjoyed this book so much. Excellently written and delivered. Great insight, recommended to anyone who wants to understand the power of opportunity and hard work.",1
"Good start, sort of slows down.. Great book for the first 5 chapters. I though the ending was kind of slow, but that's only my opinion.",1
"Best recommendation I've had. A colleague recommended this book as an interesting description of what is ""success"". Thoroughly interesting factual examples that contain concepts and notions that can be applied in professional as well as personal situations.",1
Love it. Love it,1
"Outliers. Once again, Malcolm Gladwell has provided an incisive inight into contemporary processes in our society.",1
"Buy it now, you won't regret it.. One of my favourite ever books. Gladwell is an awesome writer who provides such an educated, interesting insight on things that you just hadn't considered. This book has honestly changed the way i now think about things. Everyone should read this book.",1
"Outliers - A MUST Read. This fascinating book defies description. It is sobering, inspirational, elucidating and challenging, all at the same time. Gladwell weaves rich character portraits into numerous ""Stories of Success,"" providing insights on how opportunities and legacies created ""Outliers"" - individuals who somehow (and the author does an exceptional job of showing HOW) managed to distance themselves from their contemporaries. His examples are dizzyingly diverse, from the Beatles in Hamburg playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week (The 10,000 Hour Rule) and geniuses (being smart enough can be better than being the smartest) to Southern feuding families (die like a man) and Korean airline pilots vs. New York traffic controllers.",1
"Absolutely my favorite book of all time!!!. The first time reading this book was 10 years ago when I picked up a book from Barnes and Nobel on my way to catch a flight.  At the time, I was not much of an avid reader, nor have I ever finished an entire book in one sitting. Before I knew my flight was over, I had finished the book in entirety.",1
"Has promise, but fell short. When I ordered this book I thought it definitely had the potential to be an interested read - and it was. I dont disagree with the idea that some of the theories in this book could actually work, but the way the author went about proving them really threw me. As a scientist it is blatantly obvious when people are manipulating statistics. The author seemed to be cherry-picking numbers to fit his model, which is unfortunate because many of these models probably do work, he just went about showing that in the wrong way.",1
"Gladwell Does It Again!. Malcolm Gladwell has become one of my favorite authors. I find his perspective to be facinating and refreshing. The content of all of Malcolm's works that I have read (Tipping Point, Blink, and now Outliers) has been very useful to me in my work as a pastor, Transformation Coach and Certified NLP Practitioner. I can hardly wait to read ""What the Dog Saw.""",1
Great book. Great book,1
"Meh. I've never been so certain that I would never be successful. Apparently most success comes from being one of the lucky few who made the cuts according to age and circumstances or got lucky in every possibly way and stuck with it. That's not me, and it's probably not most peoples. So after reading the book I felt fairly deflated about my future.",0
Nice product. Nice,1
Five Stars. came in like it sohuld have,1
"Great in every way.... Not necessarily what I expected, but absolutely great in every way. Read it. I'm glad I did.",1
"A true Masterpiece. So hardwork alone doesn't make one a success, there are other things, like luck, that plays into...I could of told you that, but not so masterfully!...The author builds his cases for his claims in this book like a master lawyer does in his courtroom. This book is art, a true masterpiece where every reader will be blessed differently for taking the short amount of time it takes to get through it. A must read for all that have ever ventured after their goals and have fallen short, for sure...Maybe, just maybe, it wasn't completely your fault.",1
"Satisfied. This is a good book, and an easy read. It had some interesting concepts and ideas. Very mind opening. I am satisfied with this purchase.",1
It's in perfect condition ''new''. Item arrived on time. It's in perfect condition ''new''. Would recommend :),1
"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",1
Five Stars. Amazing!,1
"This is all common sense.. I enjoyed reading the stories in this book. It made me think. I suppose it does take more than 10,000 hours of practice to become a top notch musician or athlete or scholar. Success does take more than just brains and hard work. Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck. I agreed with everything in the book. It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control. Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against. That is unfair. As a wealthy society we lose out on great talent and ability when we don't give a chance to people who are different from us.",1
Stunning. To say that it cleared away with myths is the least I can say.Gladwell's outliers did much more for me.His mention of the 10000 rule and examples strengthened my resolve to excel in my chosen field,1
"Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am .... Gladwell's goal is to make us think. I am certainly thinking a lot more now, and appreciate his perspectives. ""Freakonomics"" for real life......",1
Loved it!. Fascinating stories I've never heard before...I read it months ago and it resonates for a long time. I find myself thinking of the interesting tidbits in this book all the time.,1
Five Stars. Interesting read,1
"Factors which contribute to success other than hard work and talent !. I always knew that the contributors of success apart from hard work and talent were circumstances, situations, opportunities, your social environment, parents, friends, culture etc. but I did not realize the impact that these factors had on one’s success until I read this book !",1
Five Stars. good,1
Great but weird too. Very interesting but also filled with weird correlations that don’t pass the statistics test.,1
“Success” Deconstructed. Gladwell deconstructs the notion of “self-made” with each and every example as what we would classify as out of the ordinary. He brings those awe-inspiring traits to a perspective that easily explains how astounding success is shaped by just the right situations and circumstances.,1
A good eye opening book. Great read with very well researched examples. Written in a very gripping and flowing way. Makes it a very interesting read.,1
Five Stars. Excellent book,1
Good. Was an interesting read. New insights to ponder on success. I found some of the stories and points a bit too repetitive at times.,1
"A Must Listen!!!! Somewhat disturbing yet.... Somewhat disturbing yet can be encouraging...Disturbing because the logic for success can be SO OUT OF OUR CONTROL yet encouraging because our choices can still effect our ability to take advantage of the coming unknowns. Well read, riveting, I dare say...You must be driven to know ""the why"" in order to appreciate this. Speaks of many well-known people and situations many can relate to.",1
Very interesting reading. This is a well written book giving a new perspective on success. It appears that it is more than raw talent that determines the likelihood of a successful life.,1
Great book!. I suggest this book to anyone that wants to be challenged to be more proficient in any area of life.,1
"Wonderful Book!. Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",1
"Ground-breaking. Surprisingly well-written, with unexpected examples of success that no one has thought of before. It will definitely change the way you think about success and it dives deep into an exploration and discovery of its determining factors. Overall, go for it without second thought.",1
Good. Quit good but not as much aspected,1
"A thought bubble that lacks substance. OK, so I like Gladwell's books. Typically he rises above the noise and hyperbole we expect from the 'guru' class of North American authors. He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line. Maybe I had completely missed the point. Maybe it is me and I simply ""didn't get it""...",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s points. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s points on how to succeed are certainly relevant in my own life, and I can see how this book will help me evaluate the decisions I make while working towards my goals. As a teenager, I find it interesting to view this new perspective that challenges the conventional ways one may come to find success. This book covers everything: how one&amp;rsquo;s culture, parents, circumstances, demographics, age, intelligence, and innate skills can all fall into place when one is merely given a chance to take the initiative and succeed. his book allowed me to question those who make it big in life: how they did it, how they started, why they started, and why other people could not be like them even though they had the same environment, lifestyle, and interests. Gladwell answered all of these questions, and it made me realize that anyone can be successful: they just need to take the initiative they are given. I also think the concept of what an Outlier really is in context to people around them. his the first book of Gladwell's that I have read, and I'm extremely glad I chose it. I love his writing style, his attention to misconception, revelations that we somehow knew were always there, yet we never chose to acknowledge them.",1
"Interesting and Empowering. This book is great not just because it challenges preconceived notions of success, but because it forces one to re-evaluate his or her own story of success. On the one hand, it can be humbling to admit that my social and cultural backgrounds play such huge roles it what I’d attributed to my own inherent greatness. On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens. I may never be as great as some of the individuals discussed in Outliers, but there is no reason to think that I can’t be on a success trajectory of my own, putting in my time practicing hard, thankless work, or cashing in on the values of my great-grandparents. As with all of Malcom Gladwell’s books, he first changes the way we think about certain things, and we then have the rest of our lives to build on what it means to think differently.",1
"1st time Gladwell reader. Gladwell has a perfect grasp of statistical relevance. He is not quite as smart as Taleb, but then neither am I; LOL. You will find this book to be an easy and enjoyable read, and I especially recommend it for new parents. I have since purchased another book by this author.",1
"Putting success into context. Very thoughtful read, encouraged me to think a little differently about how I see things",1
"Good Book and well written. The book is good, it makes you think on a different way on how the life has gone on a certain way to some people. Helps you to understand and accept what you are living, and try to identify the causes that could help you.",1
great analysis of success & a little hope. I did enjoy the many aha moments and I do embrace some of the ideas that will be applicable to my own life and that of my children.,1
Change How You View Success. This book questions the common belief that success is entirely individual. Anyone who has wondered what makes a person successful or has felt intimidated by the seemingly self-made nature of outliers would enjoy this book.,1
"Good read. This is a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to understand how the intellectual edges of society function, and to get a good dose of reality to dissipate the thought that everything in life is based solely on innate ability. Gladwell does well to pay tribute to the fundamental needs of ability, but also demonstrates how luck and timing play a significant role to unlock the abilities of those on the fringe that make the difference between world wide success and being just another Joe.",1
Five Stars. Girlfriend really enjoyed it.,1
"Addictive!. If you are the type of person who enjoy books based on real facts, informative and clever, this is probably your type of book.",1
"Underachievers will like this book. This is an interesting counter narrative to the often told success story of the individual who rises to greatness despite hardships. The author suggests success is less about individualism and more about being in the right place at the right time. There are a lot of interesting antecdotes which support this thesis. But as someone who has indeed become successful because of hard work, I somehow came away from this book feeling diminished.",1
"This shaped Shawn White the olympians career. I bought this book because Sean white has been an idol of mine since child hood and in Tim Ferris’ tribe of mentors, Shawn white proclaimed that this book had a huge impact on his career, he was a major influence in my life, I had the 2005 burton Shawn white snowboard, so I had to pick it up and gain the same insights he did, it’s a great read and If you’re going to read anything pick this up over the rest, it’s so diverse and you’ll touch on so many topics out of your regular zone of thinking it’s a very thought provoking book.",1
Four Stars. I really enjoyed reading this book. I will recommend it to anyone.,1
Five Stars. This is a book that should be required reading in high school. adults should read this as well.,1
Five Stars. incredible!,1
A Must read!!. The author gives us a very insightful perspective on how we look at success in our society. The book gives us a more in depth look at how advantages and opportunities play a major role in success.,1
"Five Stars. Great purchase, satisfied customer.!",1
"great book, better story telling. Gladwell has somehow made academic writing interesting. I not only found the book interesting and also educational and thought provoking. And his narration didn't give me nausea after 4hours of almost straight listening.",1
"The audio does not match the actual book. The voice was nice to listen to, but there were many times that there was information added or re-worded in the audio that was not in the book. I like to have the audio and book because it helps me understand the content better, and when these instances happened, it would confuse me for a few seconds.",1
"Not talent alone. The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",1
food for thought. Great read! Thought provoking.,1
Brilliant!. The audiobook version is so much better than the print version - it's a brilliant book.,1
"Five Stars. This was a very enjoyable and informative book. Not only does this detail some methods of thinking that are outside of the box and beneficial to the reader, but it also going a long way to help inspire you to overcome difficulties in your own life. While this is coming from a motivational book and speech lover, I believe that everyone could benefit by reading this book. It is my hope to teach classes one day, and this is one book that I would definitely like to bring into the classroom. I feel that students and adults alike will gain from reading. Well worth the money.",1
"Exceptionally mind-blowing and eye-opening. If you are seeking answers to many of life's great concerns and how they have affected you, how they have made you who you are, then this book is for you. Gladwell exposes all societies misconceptions around talented and successful individuals. He clears a path of understanding to demonstrate success with interesting and well written case studies.",1
"1/3 of the way in... Lives up to the reputation!. 1/3 of the way through the book, and it's awesome. Can't wait to keep reading! So insightful; I've found myself implementing some of the concepts in my life already.",1
Outstanding!. I never looked at success in this way. I'll never look at it the same again!,1
"Nature vs Nurture. The debate of Nature versus Nurture is an old one. Hero culture, that idea of individual exceptionalism willed from “boot strap” beginnings, prevails heavily in the US. What this vision lacks is the detailed history and nuanced perspective on all of the circumstances that set up success in spite of all other factors.",1
"It's a good read... But Duh?. I really like the connections Malcolm makes between Outliers and the rest of the world. But it just breaks down the key fundamental of success which is when Preparation meets Opportunity. If you knew that already, it's just more research to support this claim. Still good findings though.",1
"Not Convince By His Reasoning. After many rave reviews, I expected to enjoy the book but I didn't. I thought the point that success is factored upon opportunity and having the support of influential ppl was obvious. And you don't need a scientific research to figure that out or there is a need to proof it. However, I think he forgot that opportunities can be pursued and not brought to you and that's one major factor of successful ppl. In some cases, opportunities is a greater factor while in some cases the personal drive plays a greater role. I still feel it cannot be generalized.",0
"Excellent, thought provoking read. Well written, well, researched book. It makes sense on so many levels, wish it could be implemented by the state.",1
"Five Stars. Great Read, had to for a class, but honestly it's a good read either way.",1
Outliers: The Story of Success. Product arrived promptly as described.,1
"D&G was better.. Gladwell broke his own thesis by chapter 2. In David and Goliath, the points he proves completely contradict the ones made here.",0
Engaging stories. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book. The author kept me engaged through sharing his message through wonderful stories. Frequent bookmarking!,1
"A good book to share with the whole family. Being a successful professional, I learned a lot from this book. The author writes well to make serious topics fun to read.",1
"Just wonderful. One of my friend suggested this book to me and once i started reading this book, i realized that the success is more of a chance and it not entirely depends upon your efforts.A good read and must for those hungry for success and particularly for ambitious parents",1
very good book. Education is about opportunity and how we inspire those those to succeed. We must never stop learning but continue to grow with our own education and support others as we move through life.,1
"Fascinating!. A great study on the ""self made man!""",1
Fascinating. I couldn't stop listening. It kept me up late several nights in a row. This is probably Gladwell's best to date.,1
"Good read. This book was great to read, and had some interesting ideas, but the gist of the book is: success is more about the circumstances surrounding a person than the actual qualities of that person. The author sets it up nicely but in the end, it kind of feels like: ""Duh!""",1
Can’t complain. Great book and good quality.,1
Five Stars. What a great read! Really fascinating.,1
Great read!. Will definitely make you reevaluate your own goals and open your mind up to what your capable of being successful at.,1
"Great book. I have read this, Tipping Point and David and Goliath - I'm happy to announce that here is another great read. Gladwell writes and develops his points in a style that is accessible without being the least bit patronising. Next on the list is Blink!",1
"NOPE, NOPE and NOPE. Not my cup of tea. Malcolm Gladwell seems to, in many of his arguments, draw in heavy, dense, scholarly researches only to arrive at meaningless conclusions. Sure, his points are novel in the way that no one seem to have the time to notice (simply put, they are all common sense). I've realize that Malcolm merely assume facts and claim to logically ""infer"" the articles. Nothing spectacular. It saddens me seeing all these people buying into this.",0
"Insightful, Yet Expected. I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.",1
"This book changed my perspective about success. By a very clear writing and objective tone, Malcolm has persuaded me that there is a fine line between winners and losers in life. And the way we deal with every single matter in our daily life could put us inthis side of success or the other side.",1
More than Horatio Algerish. This is a really good book.,1
Good book with lots of information. Lots of information in the book that makes you reflect and understand how timing fits into many things. Also different pieces of history throughout the book.,1
Four Stars. good read,1
Interesting Nonfiction. The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life. It reads almost like a fiction book. The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened. He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.,1
"Time and chance. ""The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but Time and chance happen to all,"" so says the Teacher in Ecclesiastes. Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.",1
Loses direction in later part. The book gets off to a great start with some interesting concepts about potential human development,1
"Five Stars. I like all of Gladwell's stuff, very inelligent info, but easy to understand.",1
Mind opening. I always thought hard work and dedication are the keys to success which is true but to some degree.,1
Received. Interesting read,1
"My favorite Malcolm Gladwell book so far. Everything Malcolm Gladwell writes is a gem, but this one is amazing. He makes connections among people and events and demographics and cultural changes in a way no other author comes close to. The reader will learn a lot from this one and want more at the end. I learned a lot about myself as well as about this society we live in.",1
incredible. Going into the first few chapters regarding genius I was struck with the overwhelming understanding of what it meant to have a sense of community.,1
Insightful. This audible book helped me enjoy my chores and workout! Enjoyable read with great insights.,1
Three Stars. 1000 HOURS.... IT IS TRUE,1
Excellent!. I love this book so excited to read it . Get it super cheap and it’s in better condition than i was expecting! Thanks,1
Very good point of view about success. Good storie. Very good point of view about success. Good stories to get inspiration and start acting to get to an outlier mood.,1
"Cover book very disappointing. The cover book is very bad, it looks as if it was used before, some pages are badly cutted, returning this product for sure.",0
"When opportunity meets hard work. Glad well does a good job of dispelling the myth of a lone success. He more accurately depicts the opportunities that were unique in time and the individuals who recognized and took advantage of what was made available. That is to say, they worked like crazy. A good read that I found very encouraging.",1
Great book for everybody!. Great book with valuable insides into the different ways to be successful in any field.,1
worth the time investment to read. Gladwell has a very unique perspective on success and successful people. Entertaining and eye opening.,1
Great Read!. I read this book 2months after graduating from college and it was such an inspiration. Def would recommend this to anyone.,1
Eh..... This book was okay for awhile. I got bored with it halfway through. I suppose it's a philosopher type of thing.,0
Love his books!. This one was just as good as all his others!,1
"Great Book: Highly Recommended. My father had bought this book a few months ago and he recently recommended it to me. From first glancing at the cover, I was not very interested. I suspected the book would be a dull self-help book filled with tips on how to get rich and successful. To my immense delight, Outliers is far from a how-to manual. Malcolm Gladwell does not attempt to instruct his readers. Rather, he tries his best to explain why the common perception of successful people is severely flawed. People think that successful billionaires like Bill Gates achieved their triumphs single-handedly. Gladwell forces you, the reader, to delve far beyond their own personal efforts and skills; to look at the bigger picture. Gates, for example, was born in the perfect year. He was neither too young nor too old when he got into computer programming for him to be successful. Growing up in a wealthy household, Gates had the necessary resources. Additionally, he got unlimited access to the computers at the University of Washington when he was in college; He had far more programming experience than his peers of similar intelligence. Gladwell pulls out these seemingly insignificant factors but makes you believe that they, not his genius, are the reasons for his success. Among explanations for successful businessmen, Gladwell manages to throw in some really interesting observations. For instance, professional hockey players are predominantly born in January and Asian airline pilots are more likely to crash than American pilots. He emphasizes the influence of upbringing and cultural background when looking at success. The author relates the Chinese tradition of cultivating rice paddies with Chinese superiority in math. Though these claims can sound ridiculous, Gladwell elaborately explains his reasoning until it actually starts to make sense. Gladwell has a writing style that draws the audience in. I would highly recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell to anyone who possesses an open mind; anyone prepared to view success in a whole new light.",1
the book is totally BORING. If you are looking for an interesting book then this is not for you. If you want facts and success stories then read up.,0
Five Stars. Very good,1
"Fascinating. I enjoyed reading this book and it's study of the ""self made man""/genius myth very much. A fascinating insight drawn from the author's personal experience and background.",1
Fascinating. Malcolm Gladwell is really an extraordinary storyteller. I found this book to be fascinating and nearly impossible to put down. Overall I agree with his thesis (that becoming a great success is dependent on many external circumstances in addition to exceptional drive/talent/etc) but more than anything I found the stories he used about the garment industry/Jamaica/Jewish lawyers in New York/etc to be incredibly interesting and educational. I could listen to one Gladwell book after the other.,1
"I would recommend this book to anyone. Interesting premise and examples. I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female. It kind of puts personal financial ""success"" in its place.",1
"so worth the read!. An amazing book that really makes you think. Buy it and read it now, trust me you wont regret your move!",1
Book. Excelent!,1
Great read!. Loved this book! I read it in two days. It opened my eyes to many ideas I hadn’t considered.,1
HARD WORK COUNTS TOO. Great book. Reminds me of a song titled &#8220;things that make you go umm.&#8221; My only criticism: the author places too much emphasis on opportunity and not enough on the subjects taking advantage of this opportunity through hard work. The author makes a blanket conclusion that Bill Gates was the only teen to have the opportunity to program computers all the time and thus had an opportunity like no other. Well how does the author know this? Could there have been other teens with a similar opportunity but were lazy and unwilling to work as hard as Mr. Gates? To me the secret is opportunity (which sometimes you can&#8217;t control) + hard work (which you can control). Fun book. I can&#8217;t wait to read the others written by this author.,1
Five Stars. Great book! I think that every parent and every teen should read this book.,1
Five Stars. Love this book. A very unique perspective about success.,1
very good. i had to read this book for school and it was actually so good and i really enjoyed reading it,1
"Easy, quick and informative. This book was hard to put down. The ideas presented by Gladwell are approachable and very useful. The anecdotes are a little redundant but they serve to hammer his points home and by the end of the book you’ll find them well worth while. An easy, quick and informative read that I plan on revisiting",1
"Super interesting!. Just read it. It'll blow your mind. Explains so much, makes a very good point and enlightens. Definitely worth reading",1
Good research but crappy spin. The author tries to trivialize the success of others. He basically chalked everything to luck. Such a toxic outlook,0
Five Stars. Highly entertaining and informative.,1
Five Stars. Every real estate agent should take the time to read this book.,1
Five Stars. Very good condition thank you,1
Four Stars. interesting book. claims weren't always convincing,1
"Highly Recommended (letter to author). ""Outliers"" has directly related to my essential question for my senior English course. In my class our essential question is ""To what extent do time and place define a person"". The purpose of our essential question is for us to take a close look on the things around us and realize the importance of time and place. In your book this question is answered in almost every chapter. In the epilogue you tell us about the story of your mother and how she became successful. The events in her life directly related to our question because without the men and women who influenced the scholarships for Jamaican children in that time period you mother might have not been able to attend college. The epilogue for me was one of the best chapters because of the way the story was told and how well the chapter was structured to explain every facture that influenced and defined how your mother came to be successful. I also believe that chapter 6 on Harlan, Kentucky was a very intriguing chapter. The information in the chapter made me look at cultures within the United States differently, in a more understanding way. Also it made me realize that many of my southern relatives had the culture of honor. Also I found the 10,000 hours chapter a fascinating chapter. I liked how you showed many different successful people in totally different occupations, and how those people were living examples of the 10,000 hour rule. One of my favorite parts in that chapter was when you went into detail about the Beatles success story. I enjoyed this because the music industry now days it doesn't required a lot of practice to get acknowledged, but to do what the Beatles did takes an overwhelming amount of talent and I personally wish that many of the other artist out there would learn from the Beatles story and see that hard work and practice pays of rather than using technology to improve your music. Overall Mr. Gladwell I just would like to say that this book is amazing book and that it is one of my favorites. Each page of the book kept me attentive and made me want to continue reading to absorb more and more information about the people around us. Thank you very much for writing this book Mr. Gladwell.",1
"Success Unveiled!. The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: ""In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",1
Finally I understand what does work hard mean. Outliers is a book explaining what is hard work. The authors explains on different examples ranging from school kids to successful adults how origin (not ethical rather from the perspective of people patterns and behaviour in given community and country) affect persons performance.,1
"Gotta love when authors narrate their own work.. Gladwell is one of those authors who I was skeptical of, thinking that he was perhaps a bit built up and unworthy of the adoration he receives. However, his work lives up to the hype, and this is well worth the read.",1
Great book from an excellent author. I love this book it shows the mechanics of success and really gets you thinking about your own successes and how to ensure your families success in the future,1
Some Interesting Facts. A very well written and well researched book looking into why certain groups of the population are more successful than others.,1
Thrilled. This was my first audio book. I love Malcom gladwell and it was as if he was in my living room talking to me. What a great first experience to have him read to me. Cannot wait until I hit all of his books. Thank you again,1
"Not entirely new Idea but pleasure to read.. Like other bestsellers Blink and Tipping point, Malcom Gladwell has written compelling stories. He has tried to find out what makes people successful. This book is not about how to be successful, but tells about how opportunities and legacy play role in life of successful people. This book is more about the circumstances where one has little control over and how these circumstances affect us, Except 10,000 hour rules, which explains how hard work and persistence is more important than intelligence and innate talent.",1
Good read for awhile. Got tired of it Three quarters through. Got the idea of the principles.,1
Five Stars. I love statistics,1
fascinating. really a fascinating book about people we consider exceptional. well read and clear. highly recommend,1
"Amazingly insightful. Malcolm gladwell goes deep behind the secrets of some of the most famous and successful individuals. It is a ride that is worth taking a million times over, can't wait to read it again.",1
"Four Stars. Very interesting book, food for thought!",1
"Read it for a couples book club. Good, but not something I would normally pick.. Interesting and thought provoking.",1
Five Stars. Thanks,1
"We can all be outliers and this book explains how!. What is an Outlier? How do people become outstanding in their field? Are the born with a skill? Do you have to learn a skill? Do you have to be born at the right time? Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”? The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time. Were they the brightest or the best? As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",1
Just getting back into reading for enjoyment-- what a great choice.. First book in a long time that I have started to read for personal pleasure. The book is written well and still has it's grips on me!,1
Fantastic. Great book that shows insight into understanding why certain people succeed. Interesting concepts. I'll be reading all of Gladwell's books after this one.,1
Five Stars. Loved this book fascinating stories,1
"Reminds me of a Seinfeld episode. I enjoyed both of Gladwells previous books, but was hesitant to pick up Outliers. When I browsed through it at the bookstore it just didn't grab me. I finally ordered it through Amazon and read it this past weekend.",1
"Excellent Book. Although I don't 100% agree with final conclusion, but this is an excellent book that explains many details about success that I have never thought about them.",1
"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I Believe his theory on 10,000 hours makes sense to me. I highly recommend thid book.",1
"GOOD BOOK. Very interesting and motivational. I'm only writing this review to meet the twenty word requirement on the kindle review, so yea.",1
brilliant. loved it yet again!! all the books are awesome,1
Great author. Great author,1
Brilliant examples - would love more obscure ones too. All of the examples were eye opening and yet oddly predictable. The way he wrote was addicting and easy to digest. I would love a book by him on agriculture and farmers/ farmer suicides.,1
"Not ""Very Good"" condition. This is a great book and Malcolm Gladwell is fantastic, but this copy of the book was in poor condition despite being sold as ""very good"".",0
Excellent book.. I would recommend this book to young folks looking for direction in their life. Experiences of others just as history can be learned from to shape our future. This books covers both as well as psychological and social view of human psyche.,1
"For some it will form a new perspective towards achieving success. Some people have the illusion of being able of becoming successful all by them self, thinking that working hard and being disciplined are all the necessary ingredients. This people in turn often forget to mention the opportunities and assistance that others make possible for them. No body achieve success without help from someone else -even if this help is minimal, a statement that other books on personal education and advancement also support, like ""Never Eat Alone"" by Keith Ferrazzi. Luck is when opportunity and experience or knowledge meets, which in my opinion summarizes much of this book.",1
Brilliant!. Absolutely Enjoyed it! Intelligent,1
"A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make. This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",0
globalized perspective. Great look on how historical circumstances create modern society and how those circumstances also create an outlier.,1
"Thought provoking. I think the author is over emphasizing the role of luck. While he makes a compelling case with great anecdotal evidence, I think classifying people like Bill Gates our Steve Jobs as ordinary people presented with extraordinary opportunities is not giving due credit to what makes these outliers such super achievers.",1
"Evocative, intriguing, powerful. This is such an amazing book! Gladwell is a fantastic writer. This book really changed the way I feel about education and success. Highly recommend. It's one of the best modern books I've read in a very long time.",1
Paradigm Shift. I like to think that we are a product of our environment and this book argues that point well.,1
Awesome Read. A thought provoking and inspiring book...very insightful with good examples and scenarios. Easy to follow narration.,1
"Different take on success. The concept isnt new, but the way it's portrayed with gripping stories and backgrounds of successful individual is amazing. worth a read.",1
Interesting book!. An interesting perspective on why some people are successful and others are not - opportunity. I would recommend this book to all of my friends along with another little book I purchased the other day,1
"mind bogling! new approach to success!. I wasn't expecting much of another success story; however Malcolm gives such a straight forward and pseudo-scientific approach of how people achieve success, that I'm still ""in shock""!",1
"objective take at interpreting outliers. I loved how author's analysis was so in depth, incorporating cultural differences to its finest details. I grew up from Korea, and the section about Korean Airline and accident rate due to cultural emphasis on power differentials was truly awakening. Recommended to anyone who live in international society.",1
"Worthwhile Read!. Malcolm Gladwell is such a phenomenal thinker and writer! I bought this book, along with Start with Why, for my 16 year old nephew who is pondering his place in the world. These two books, along with Malcolm Gladwell's other work has personally helped me gain a better understanding of myself and others, and has helped me change how I live my life. Buy the book!",1
entertaining listen. entertaining listen very easy to visualize in your mind as you go with the audio.,1
Fantastic and Humbling. A lesson through the stories of other success. I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks to be successful in anything. I love that it was read by the author. I believe this give you the best experience when listening.,1
Excellent!. one of my all time favorite books - bonus points for the author's voice and cadence.,1
"Fun reading, interesting conclusions, but lacking credibility. Coincidentally, I read the chapter about the relative ages of hockey players while I was watching the Chicago Blackhawk beat the Detroit Red Wings in game 7 of the western finals. I thought ""wow this is an amazing insight!"" However, after a quick check of the birth dates for the players I found Malcolm's conclusion to be bunk. Contrary to the book, there is an almost even distribution of birth months for the team members I checked multiple years and countries of origin just to be sure that I hadn't discovered another ""Outlier"". After this discovery,I have to call into question all that I have read from him. Maybe the book should be renamed to ""Outliars!""",0
"Time and chance. ""The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but Time and chance happen to all,"" so says the Teacher in Ecclesiastes. Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.",1
"Amazing Book that Has Really Opened my Eyes Regarding How I View the Successful. My business mentor, Caterina Rando, has often referenced this book when speaking about the benefits of 10,000 hours towards mastery. I finally got around to listening to it and was blown away by everything I learned.",1
"Excellent book. The many interesting facts presented in the book are thought provoking. Moreover, now when considering what led to the success of an individual, some of the factors that at first would appear to be disadvantages should instead be viewed as those that directly led to their success.",1
It was “eh”. I could sum up this book with “work hard and put a lot of time in and hope luck is on your side”. It’s not a great listen. I’ve heard it’s a better read but I honestly don’t think I would’ve made it through had I tried to read it. I knew it was gonna be rough when the opening of the book starts with a 20 minute diatribe on hockey players birthdays.,1
"Outliers- an insightful perspective in those outside the box. Glad well provides not only insight, but intensive research into understanding outstanding achievement. This text provides lessons for all of us to benefit in our own development.",1
Great Read. Great understanding of the &quot;lucky break&quot; and the reality of the need for hard work and application to acquire a skill and success,1
"Practice makes perfect!. I always thought that certain people posses traits which make them better at somethings than most. But this book does a great job dispelling this type of thinking. The stats are striking and make sense. A good read in my opinion for all readers. I still think that some people are just naturally better at things, especially sight or peripheral vision which make them better at sports than most, but practice could account for that as well. This books goes into the background of why people are better at things. It makes sense.",1
Men of action are favored by the Goddess of luck. I was excited to read this book because of the great reviews. I only made it halfway and decided there was nothing to gain from this book.,0
"An Outliers' Tipping Point. Why this book matters: I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers. When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell. Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience. Many books are a great read. How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come? To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance. Well written book, well researched, and inspiring others to greatness. Don't blink Malcolm, you have created a tipping point.",1
"interesting. Very interesting perspective. Much of the information is the author's speculation, yet he presents them as facts. This is the sign of a poor journalist and a dishonest man.",1
"You'll Never View Success the Same Ever Again!. Malcolm Gladwell's writing is simple and easy to comprehend but yet has such deep profound insights. His books like Outliers take modern issues and he finds very simple solutions to them that were there just staring right at your face. When Malcolm points out these solutions, you just hit your head and say why didn't I think of that?",1
I love malcom. malcom is a brilliant author and a soothing narrator. I love all of his content and this book was no outlier.,1
Brilliant. Very readable and full of interesting insight. Makes you think about one's own successes (and failures) in a new light.,1
Charles Achibiri. Simply brilliant. Every parent should read or listen to this book. Malcolm takes you on a journey of self-reflection.,1
Interesting read. Points out the things in plain sight which are often over-looked. Give each person a fighting chance if they are willing to engage deeply had with all of themselves.,1
Thought Provoking. This book is a fascinating study on how people become successful. It will challenge you to look at your own life and make changes for the better.,1
"Who Knew?!. This a great book! If you ever wanted a working theory on how to be successful, or how those you admired became successful, this is the book to read. Very thought provoking, convincing, creative and entertaining!",1
"An thought provoking and inspiring read. This book was recommend to me a friend; I'm glad I read it. The examples and real life stories shared are unique and thought provoking - the book makes you rethink common beliefs out there as to why people are successful and the real reasons behind their high achievements etc. At times the book is a drag as it builds little stories to make clear, definitive illustrations in the end. All in all, this is a good uplifting read.",1
"Simply explained and still the stories intrigue!. I first discovered Malcolm Gladwell through his podcast, Revisionist History because I, too, at that time was thinking about doing a podcast to tell my stories. And while I was not the one to buy the book and my husband not listening to podcasts, I would speaking highly of Mr. Gladwell. My husband the. Took his Master Class online and then bought this book.",1
Good quality book. Good quality!,1
good book. I am about 1/3 the way through the book an dit is a very interesting read so far. Looking forward to the rest.,1
A different theory.. An interesting presentation concerning achievement and what are the reasons some are successful. A different theory than the usual work hard and have inherited abilities.,1
"good book describing what it takes to become really successful. This is a book which would change your notions about success. Most people have the belief that hard work alone could make you successful. But, in this book, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the underlying factors which have an indirect influence on success.",1
"Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the .... Outliers is a fascinating explanation for the reasons behind the success of somewhat talented, but ordinary people who were given an opportunity to excel at just the right age and at just the right time and those factors were key in creating extraordinary talent and success. This book gives surprising reasons for why intelligence, talent and or money aren't the only factors for the success of certain individuals.",1
"Insightful. This book will change your perspective on success. Whatever your definition of success is, it will encourage you to examine and position yourself for success.",1
Very Good. good,1
"Great book. I have read this, Tipping Point and David and Goliath - I'm happy to announce that here is another great read. Gladwell writes and develops his points in a style that is accessible without being the least bit patronising. Next on the list is Blink!",1
Five Stars. Arrived on time and as advertised.,1
"interesting look at success and failure.. I fond myself reading chapters twice, they were so interesting. I have had many conversations due to the information in this book, and have found myself researching figures mentioned.",1
Very enlightening on how greatness is cultivated!. Very enlightening on how greatness is cultivated! I would definitely recommend this book! Everyone needs the opportunity to be great.,1
"Relatively entertaining.... A few insights here & there, but overall too simplistic. Clearly written to be a best seller, if you know what I mean.",1
Sorry. You have to work for it!!!. This book was a look into my life as an immigrant and child of immigrants. Explains that hardwork is why people make it. Our society needs this book. Handouts to commonplace in our entitled system.,1
"Great. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It explains why those individuals who excel to star status in several fields are able to do so. These are Bill Gates, Beatles level discussions, not that of your exceptional preteen grand kids who amaze the scholars at Harvard with their brilliance. We think we know why people succeed, but we are usually far from the real reasons.",1
"Great book!. Shows how Amazing people got where they are with a combination of luck, skill, opportunity, and hard work",1
Great book!. Uncovers and makes sense of the small occurrences that end up making huge differences in many lives. Read if you want to learn.,1
"Success, redefined.. Malcolm Gladwell tells a story, using statistical samples and everyday examples that apply to most people. He reveals the true hard work of becoming an outlier, a 'freak of nature.'",1
"fantastic book, well written. fantastic book, well written, unbiased, full of interesting facts and information. enjoyable read. not sure what i got out of it, but it was interesting read, nonetheless.",1
The Victim of Circumstance Handbook. No one is better than me I just wasn't born as lucky as Bill Gates and I wasn't good at hockey as my brothers because my birthday was in September. It couldn't be because I'm not good at anything.,0
"this is quick read I'd highly recommend for anyone. Extremely interesting, but cuts some corners in how it presents evidence and ideas that are, from my experience in class at college, are more complex that Gladwell presents. However, for a more casual reader that wants an interesting book on genetics, behavior, and broader society, this is quick read I'd highly recommend for anyone.",1
More than Horatio Algerish. This is a really good book.,1
"Perhaps my book of the year 2020. Reminds of Yuval Noah Harari in a way it's written: simple, informative, clever.",1
Outliers review. Educators should especially listen to this book tape. It is well worth the understanding they will receive in educating students.,1
Five Stars. A must read,1
One of my favorite reads. Love this book,1
Best book I've ever read. Malcolm gladwell explains concepts and relates every idea he's talked about together. A truly world class author,1
Great book on success for teens. Very interesting facts about success especially. About the Beatles. TRied to buy it for a teenager interested in music at the local store but it was sold out. SOme high schools are requiring it for students.,1
"Interesting theory. I don't think he adequately proved his hypohesis, but it is interesting reading. It DOES give one food for thought and conversation - if not necessarily convincing one of the accuracy of his conclusion.",1
Five Stars. Fascinating,1
"A must-read for every parent. Sadly, any adult who reads this in the hope of learning the secrets of success will be many years too late to apply said information.",1
"The autgot misses what his own data shows him. In my own personal experience, people that work really hard - not his pay lip service to it - are the rarest thing in our western society. While nobody denies that timing and place are critical, hard work is the difference. Leonardo Davincci conceived of the idea of a helicopter, but could not build one because he was so ahead of his time. Yet he would never have gone there except for his indomnitable spirit and hard work.",0
"Bringing light to what ought to be obvious but isn't. Interesting, thought provoking and easy to read but also feels a little facile.",1
Great book. Very easy and mostly entertaining book.,1
Interesting. Interesting but a bit repetetive,1
"Great book!. Outliers gives an excellent and true explanation about the success factors, taking opportunities, practicing, learning about your past and looking to succeed with this.",1
Excellent. Excellent book,1
Quick read and makes you think!. This book meshes numbers and stories that will make you think. Worth a read for sure! Reinforces there is more to life than talent!,1
Cheaper. Bought this book for son. Content are good and cheaper than book stores.,1
"Three Stars. Good read, some basic information in some sections.",1
Great book and product delivery.. Reliably thoughtful and well written. Can't go wrong with Gladwell.,1
Five Stars. I'm glad I got it. A good buy!,1
Five Stars. GREAT BOOK!,1
"Must read!. Amazing book. LOVE. Top 5 favorite. Very fast read, lots of info, very informative!",1
"One of my favorite authors. Always learn something valuable from Malcolm Gladwell. One of my favorite authors. Always learn something valuable from Malcolm Gladwell. He allows you to understand things in life like a scientist without having to plow through complex jargon. He has that wonderful nature about him that comes through his writing: unassuming, intelligent, humble, informative, with a humanitarian disposition. I read all of his books :)",1
Five Stars. great book,1
"Very good. Well written about a fascinating view of ""outliers"". Very good. Well written about a fascinating view of ""outliers"".",1
So amazing!. I am a 13 y/o and I had to write a book report for this book and ended up typing 1518 words!,1
Five Stars. This book is a must read for everyone!,1
Five Stars. I really enjoyed this book.,1
"Recommended. Great book, very realistic and gives a great perspective about life's opportunities.",1
Brilliant and mind-altering.. This book redefined how I look at success. It has given me the perspective necessary to understand how it works. It was also an exciting read.,1
Great!. This book makes you think and take notes. it makes you want to implement some new ideas into your own life.,1
"Five Stars. Great book, arrived in great condition.",1
Four Stars. good book to read if you want to know about success,1
"Great, interesting read. I enjoyed Gladwell's insight. This was a very thought provoking! I will definitely read his other works. American schools should take a chapter from this book!",1
"Good book but repetitive. I kind of liked the book at first but then it became a bit repetitive for me. Like, okay, I get it, Malcolm. I didn't expect it to be a bunch of examples to prove the same point. I started skipping them towards the end.",1
Not bad. pushed two ideas: hard helps get you there but it matters more where and when you come from.,1
"A thought bubble that lacks substance. OK, so I like Gladwell's books. Typically he rises above the noise and hyperbole we expect from the 'guru' class of North American authors. He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages. Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works. Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered. I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together. Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line. Maybe I had completely missed the point. Maybe it is me and I simply ""didn't get it""...",0
Fantastic. Great book that shows insight into understanding why certain people succeed. Interesting concepts. I'll be reading all of Gladwell's books after this one.,1
"Enlightened.. I was enlightened by the stories on the book. Great read, will look for other works by the author.",1
"One of Best. I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",1
Wonderful. Page quality ist good. Pages are too yellow .,1
Five Stars. Exactly what we wanted,1
Four Stars. Another well done book by Gladwell. It does jump around some.,1
"Great book. Great book, easy to read, REALLY interesting. Bought this because I saw Gladwell's TED ""David and Goliath"" talk and decided to start out with this book before reading that one. It is very interesting and very easy to read, although there is an issue with the side notes and the e-version, so that detracted from the experience, but that's Amazon's fault, not the authors.",1
"Confusing and Disjointed. There are some great ideas and sections of this book but as a whole, it was hard to follow where he was going. I was so surprised by his odd conclusion at the end and it seemed disjointed and abrupt. Though parts of this book are informative, exciting and interesting, I would not recommend this as a whole.",0
"Four Stars. Good insight, but some points seemed a little too contrived.",1
Great book. Great book,1
"Fascinating, Fascinating, Fascinating. I read Malcolm Gladwell's ""BLINK - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking"" and enjoyed it very much!! I chose ""Outliers"" just to read something else by this author. I was not remotely disappointed - in fact found this book to be favored over the first one. I found that his ideas provided me with an understanding of ""true life success"" in a manner that I had never considered. Perception is the individual's Reality and this book changed my perception. I was personally challenged and inspired like I cannot believe. I did not give it 5 stars because if you are not a person who desires to ""stay"" with a detailed thought process, - you might find the writing tiring but my recommendation is that when you get to that point, ....just put it down and pick it up later. You won't be sorry.",1
Fascinating book !!. This book will change your thinking about intelligence. Gladwell's message is - intelligence comes from a lot of hard work and well-times opportunity.,1
"One of the best I've read!. During a discussion during a recent checkup, my doctor recommended I read this book. It gave me a totally new way of looking at life and success. I now understand more clearly why some people seem ""luckier"" than others in their lives outcomes. Very eye opening. The Author is fantastic, and I love the way he closed with his personal story. I will read more from Gladwell!",1
Worth reading. Interesting read. Still haven't finished it because the book drags in some places.,1
Amazing Book. This is an amazing book full of wisdom and insight. Plenty of thought provoking knowledge.,1
"Interesting perspective!. I preferred BLINK to this read, but OUTLIERS was still a good read in regards to a unique perspective as to why certain people are inherently successful. Give it a go!",1
"DISAPPOINTED in Gladwell: Bad Journalism to make a point to wrong audience.... I like Malcolm, I really do. However I can not endorse with clear conscience his recent book. This book is fraught with incomplete and sometimes downright inaccurate statistics that are made up to make the point that Malcolm is trying to make (see some examples below).",0
It fell short of my expectations. Found it abrupt .... It fell short of my expectations. Found it abrupt and the dots did not connect so well as expected. My perception ....,0
Five Stars. Infinitely interesting.,1
psychology and self examination made simple. Gladwell has the uncanny ability to reveal the psychology of the human species and cause any sincere observer to turn his mirror on oneself. Great read. Very thought provoking!,1
"Four Stars. Very interesting book, food for thought!",1
"Interesting, well written and thought provoking.. It's one of those books where you keep telling people snippets of information (badly reproduced)",1
"Fascinating!. This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and I cannot wait to listen to the next. Love that it is narrated by Gladwell himself, he has a wonderful voice and intonations are perfect and authentic (obviously, since he wrote it!)",1
Excellent!. I will apply many lessons from this book. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. My kids sre readind it as well! For parents it is an absolute must read.,1
"A Unique View of Success. This book has a different perspective on what makes people successful. It's not just rugged individulalism that determines greatness. A lot of other factors need to be there - opportunity, location, timing and even a little luck. There are some points that I don't agree with. But, as always Gladwell gets you to really look at things differently. If you study success and the successful you will want to add this book to your list. If you get the audio book as I did, make sure you listed to the interview at the end.",1
"Retrospective piece about Cultural Legacies. This is a book that I am glad I pushed through to the end. The ending of this book brought everything in the previous chapters together. As an educator, I found myself nodding, agreeing and enlightened from chapters 8 until the end of the book. This book shows the bigger picture of how people and for what reasons they find success. I will probably go back and reread Chapter 8 and 9. Most relatable and interesting parts of the book.",1
A must read. Reading this books gives you a new understanding of the forces that contribute to our success.,1
"Inspiration for those who appear to be out of step.. Gladwell is always a great read. His ability to take diverse stories and weave them into a form that supports his thesis is wonderful. Good stories, good premise. Thanks Malcolm.",1
Excellent work. An exceptional work on why and how and when an oppportunity to success is born and brought to fruition. An excellent insight shared in an understandable manner.,1
"Insightfully great read about ""super stars"". I speed through this book. every bit of it was great. really goes to show the value of hard work and this quote:",1
"Exciting and entertaining!. In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, Mr. Gladwell explains various different situations and stories of success that have happened in the past millenium. This book reminded me of the many success stories that happen in people's lives, and provided some background about how these people became successful. Throughout the novel, Gladwell stresses one of his major points which was ""The Matthew effect"" which explained being born in the right time and place. He talks about Canadian hockey players that have a birthday between January- March usually end up being the most successful out of the players that are born in that year. I don't think that being born in a specific month then it has being born in another month. A person born in January and a person born in September can both be equally successful even if a person was born earlier. While some good players are born in these months, he does not give a clear explanation on the certain variables that causes the early-born athletes to perform better. Another one of his points that Gladwell explains in this novel was the ""10,000 hour rule"". I have always heard of the phrase ""practice makes perfect"", and was curious as to how Gladwell would have explained it. He states that in order to be a professional, you must spend at least 10,000 hours practicing and polishing your art. He gives many famous examples of professionals who have followed this rule and become professionals. I just found it intriguing that such successful people such as Bill Gates and The Beatles followed this rule to be successful. I was always curious to see how Bill Gates became one of the most successful CEOs in the world and Gladwell explained about the dedication and work ethic that he had in order to succeed. One example is the famous rock band The Beatles. The Beatles's story about how they constantly practiced and played their gigs for many hours a day, and thrived as musical prodigies for playing for about 10,000 hours. I was wondering if the way you deal with practice might have an effect on the 10,000 rule and becoming successful? After the chapter about the 10,000 rule, Gladwell elaborated on the story about Asians being good at math and their cultivating rice patties. He talks about how the Asians had ancestors who worked extremely long hours to absorb ""perseverance"" and ""tenacity"". They also have a language advantage, since certain Asian numbers are easier organized compared to other languages, and are easier to say. The Asian Math story actually intrigued me because people always stereotype Asians saying that they are always good at math. I never realized how Asian's language's numbers are much more simpler compared to the complex numbers of the languages and Gladwell helped clarify that. My parents who are heavily old fashioned and follow the Asian culture, I finally realize what they have been trying to get through to me all of these years. I could definitely relate to all of this, and now I seem to fully understand why Asians are superior at math and the explanation that patience is a virtue with the reference to the rice patties. After reading ""Outliers"", Gladwell helped clear up a couple misconceptions of success as well as provide some very detailed explanations on how famous people got to where they are today. I liked the many stories and examples that Gladwell used throughout the novel, and I hope that future generations can read about success through Gladwell's point of view.",1
"Interesting stories well told but obvious conclusion. A number of interesting vignettes are analyzed and conclude as expected that success is a combination of talent, and realized opportunity also known as mazal",1
"Right place, right people, right time - success. The narrator is the author, gives the book authenticity. Book is inspirational and is thought provoking.",1
"can be written in an easier way!. I think the concept behind this book is great,however stories were written in a complicated way! Would be better if stories were shorter.",0
"Well worth the read. In typical Malcolm Gladwell fashion, this book is both very though-provoking and preconception-challenging...a must-read for any outside-the-bix thinkers.",1
"The secret about Ouliers!. I'm so glad I finally finished this book, I actually stopped reading it for about a week because I thought some of the explanations were BS until everything started to come together in the last 2 chapter's! Good save and i loved his personal story being shared. Outliers are not created as much as they are cultivated for greatness.",1
Good read. Good read!,1
Hard work is a cultural tradition.. The discussion of rice economy influencing the focus on education in the Far East as a work hard mentality vs. the correlation with lower scores in the US and it's more free time practice was convincing.,1
"Amazingly insightful. Just a remarkable book. Well researched and written, Gladwell makes you feel as though you are finding the answers to these questions and learning together. Highly recommend.",1
Eye opening. Excellent book identifying the minutiae of circumstances which provide successful individuals the opportunities to develop their talents. This book inspires me to consider how to serve underprivileged young people with a new outlook on what may be more beneficial skills on which to focus.,1
"Outliers Explains Success Surprisingly Simply. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"" has explained individual success as Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" explained regional success. Success is a combination of good luck, application, and perserverence. But, luck is always a part. There are no self-made men just as there is no racial superiority. Interesting and easy reading of a compelling argument for this conclusion.",1
Outliers. I got this as a gift for my son who is a family man. He loved it very much and would recommend it himself.,1
"Not what I expected. So, it seems that people that have success were just in the right moment, raised by the right family and were born at the appropriate time. Even the mother of the author. I can agree in some of the points made by the author; yes, those people were in certain circumstances that they took advantage of and bum! Success was the consequence. So, if you just want to hear the stories of these people and what circumstances surrounded them to be successful then go ahead and buy the book. But, and here is a breaking point, if you want to learn something of these stories to apply it to your own life and maybe also be successful, then that’s another different story, the book won’t provide it to you so easily. You have to interpret it. My interpretation is that you have to be aware of your own “circumstances”, your strengths and your advantages that life provides you, and you have to be able to take advantage of them. That’s it. If you are blind to those advantages or circumstances that you have, then you won’t catch them and you won’t be successful or don’t as successful as you could be. So open your eyes. Be aware and know what time you are living, and “see” what you have in your favor. I am not sure that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs were aware or what they have in their hands and they consciously took advantage at that time…maybe after 30 years they were able to see it, but well, that’s another discussion.",0
Good way to kill a couple of days at lake reading book. Was interesting read,1
Must buy!. Got this book at just 210....,1
"Gives you something to think about. Outliers was full of interesting examples. Our lives are intertwined with opportunity from positive, negative and neutral experiences. We don't often realize the lucky breaks in the moment. Great author.",1
"Ser exitoso es también cuestión de suerte. Este libro te lleva a cuestionar la idea de que el éxito de las personas famosas en diferentes áreas son resultado de su esfuerzo cuando en realidad es una suma de factores adicionales como su entorno, su herencia cultural y la suerte.",1
Good read!!. Awesome book to read!! This book is intriguing and interesting to read. I enjoyed reading it as it was interesting to see the thought process behind it.,1
"This book will change your ideas about what causes people to be successful!. This book was surprising & eye opening! It gives very plausible reasons why some people are so successful or talented. It’s not because they have natural talent, either! It also explains how a pilot’s culture can cause a plane to go down. This is the most interesting book I have read in a very long time. It gives great hope to anyone who wants to be very good or great at something! It’s easy to read & very enlightening!!!",1
"Five Stars. I recommend this book for anyone. Insightful and informative, I couldn't stop reading until I finished the book!",1
Five Stars. I'm a huge fan but this book was incredible,1
"Insightful read!. It is a jam packed book dealing with dispeling the misconceptions of success we have in mind. Readers alike will be enthralled with a ""new"" definition of what it means to be a successful achiever. Moreover, the author uses data and evdence to corroborate the theories behind what makes a person reach the pinnacle of the ladder. It is a definite fresh take on many misleading theories we have. A brilliant and excellent read! appy reading viee",1
Five Stars. I really enjoy reading another Gladwell's book.,1
"An easy and good book to read. Short review but a lot of what is discussed is common sense and general knowledge but the author takes a interesting twist it on things by using real life examples and scenarios, that elevate your knowledge base of what makes some people successful and others not. More over, it is a very easy fluent book to read which also made it interesting.",1
I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I'm a little biased because I really enjoy Gladwell's books. I greatly appreciate how he incorporates data and research into his logic. It gives my brain some substance to chew on. Outliers is great at pushing the reader to rethink how they evaluate success and consider what factors really effect finding it. Gladwell's writing style is very accessible and not overly academic which I also like.,1
"Interesting….. First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",1
Interesting ready by a talented writer.. Very interesting read by a talented writer. Mr. Gladwell knows how to captivate and educate at the same time. Fascinating.,1
"I do not like to read, but when I do I read ........ Loved the down to earth tone when talking about some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...",1
Five Stars. Great book.,1
Excellent book!. It highlights how circumstances can allow for success.,1
"SUCCESS? WHAT DOES THIS GUY KNOW ABOUT SUCCESS?!. AWFUL, BORING, (the author looks) CREEPY, DULL and I could go on and on and on! I literally had to FORCE myself to read this dreadful excuse for a book. Why this poorly developed sad excuse for a book ever got published, I'll never know, (it must be by the same idiots who thought Twilight was a good idea.) I love to read and usually can't put a book down, however, this was just begging for me to throw it across the room to it's rightful place-the toilet. The thought that students are being required to read this is pathetic and shows what a poor idea of literature certain teachers have in mind. Let the students read the classics, new books, science fiction, autobiographies, graphic novels, basically ANYTHING but this bore! In a few hundred years, a new breed of human (or maybe aliens) will be digging up remains of our civilization and questioning it's demise, and they'll uncover the Outliers, see teachers attempt to force their students to read and learn from it, and quickly realize why we went downhill. My family runs out of toilet paper fairly quickly, the only upside of owning this book is that we can use it for TP, in case the store is closed.",0
A Must read for anyone and everyone who is on a journey of self development. Loved every word,1
"Great Book with great views, lost me as it went on. Gladwell does a great job of showing you ""the other side of the coin,"" when it comes to success. Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over. Advantages they inherently had. He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying. He picks great examples and this really helps the book. The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)",1
"Another Highly Interesting Read from Gladwell, Althought it is the Weakest of the Three Books I have Read by Him (Tipping Point and Blink being the Others). Gladwell is simply an amazing writer. His books make you want more and more. His thesis here about opportunities being given to people by virtue of circumstance has great applicability with respect to early tracking of students, athletes and any other endeavor where kids are grouped early in life and especially within twelve month blocks of time. However, the thesis is clearly incomplete because it fails to explain why different people who are given the same situational opportunities are unequally able to take advantage of them: that is, there must be some role for innate ability and other situational benefits that are not the product of history and time period. (i.e., a highly motivated descendant of Irish farm workers [not European Jewish garment worker]) who struggles to maintain an atmosphere of high dedication to learning and achievement in the home and produces a child who founds a large law firm who was not born in the early 1930s) Gladwell can be forgiven, however, because his ideas do add to the discourse of factors that go into mega-success. I will also apply them as ""the system"" attempts to track my own son when he enters school, athletics, music, art, etc. ""Outliers"" still gets the five stars from me because Gladwell is such a highly engaging writer.",1
"Good book with excellent other books references. This book has some good chapters, mainly the first one when he really talks about the secret to success — HARD WORK! But also gave a good reference to Hofstede work, which I was not familiar with! For that I am very thankful!",1
Five Stars. Excellent read for all who are interested in development of areas --especially with young children.,1
Four Stars. Not bad,1
A different take on success. l loved this book. I listened to it twice and they second time was just as good. Gladwell made two excellent points regarding education. Tracking children too early developmentally is detrimental. The same is true for sending a 4 year old to full day kindergarten. I waited until my son was nearly 6 before he started school.,1
Amazing what we don't take in to consideration.. This book was spectacular. I thought I might get bored and not like it but I wanted to finish it in one day!! One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. I would recommend to anyone.,1
"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye.""",0
"good. condition as stated, good value",1
Utterly Disappointed. quality of the book was very poor. pages had overwritten writting and it looked like it was not original but zerox'd,0
"4/5. I thought Outliers was not Gladwell's best work, but it was not terrible to read. The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",1
This book decodes our world. Every chapter delivers insight into why we are where we are by examining the most successful of us. it's comforting to know why we succeed and to what and whom we owe our particular opportunities. I'm about to listen to this again. an amazing book!,1
Malcolm Gladwell never disappoints. MG gives an alternate view to consider regarding things we thought we knew! A must read (or listen to)!,1
"The effect of circumstance. Great perspective on how life's circumstances have as much to do with success as IQ. It is a confirmation that being aware and taking advantage of opportunities that might easily be taken for granted, can change the path of a person's life 180 degrees.",1
Five Stars. absolutely phenomenal read!,1
"Flawed. In my opinion, Gladwell's concept is interesting , and I enjoyed reading about the hockey players, the Beatles, the technology giants, etc. who fall into the parameters that fit his concept BUT.... there must be TONS of exceptions to his ""rules"" that do NOT fit his parameters and, to me,this is the great unaddressed flaw which makes his book/his theory both weak and questionable.",1
"Homework.... This is an amazing book for anyone in business. No matter your position, whether you are a CEO or an intern this book helps you develop the mindset of how to be an effective businessman or woman. The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise. As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success. The concepts outlined in Outliers are not new but have a rather new feel and relevance to them that will definitely help you grow as an entrepreneur. I am student at the University of Baltimore and I was assigned this book as a required reading. Luckily I had already read this twice before, but I still enjoyed the read. It’s always refreshing to review the information presented in this book. If you haven’t already, add this text to your library.",1
Great!. Not finish reading it yet. But so far so good.,1
MUST READ. Fantastic book. Talks about success in a way where you dont feel you have been failing all your life. So the stories and characters are great. It is not one of those I told you so books it actually teaches through its stories.,1
His best book by far. His best book by far. A great gift for him and her and even for those that do not like to read books.,1
Highly recommend. Very interesting and insightful,1
"Fun and informative, like all the rest.. If you've liked any of Malcolm Gladwell's other books, you will probably like this one as well. It's the same, but different. Same formatting, same pacing, same kind of examples, but obviously the examples themselves are different. I thoroughly enjoy them all. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to learn and absorb factoids for future retrieval. This book is full of 'em.",1
Meaningful. It feels like a story. Even though it's 20 stories it never feels like data research. I'm astonished at how many stories he tells. I often find myself trying to retell particular stories from his book because they seem to relate quickly to the rest of my life and the lives of others around me.,1
Absolutely amazing!!!. This was a fascinating book that dives into the reasons why some of the most successful and brilliant people we know of are where they are. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about how our environment shapes our futures.,1
There are a great deal more external factors in your life that you .... It makes you think outside the box. There are a great deal more external factors in your life that you may not be aware of.,1
"The unfairness of success -- an unexpectedly important book. In Outliers, journalist Malcolm Gladwell examines the accidents of birth date, language, heritage and culture which give particular individuals a head-start in life -- or, equally, result in catastrophic failures. Although journalistic rather than scientific in style, Gladwell makes a wide range of compelling points which become stronger the more you think about them. This is an exceptional book and -- unlike so many of the books of this type -- really does make a significant contribution to how we view our world.",1
"Simple Yet Complex. This was my 1st Malcolm Gladwell AudioBook, I also read along w/ a copy of the book. The examples used are golden in how they intertwine lessons about culture, environment, & oppurtunities given. This is a must read for any (young or old) entrepreneur or someone wanting to understand how someone comes to bestow the chances at success. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell!",1
"WOW!!. LOVED IT!!! very interesting book, i needed it for my statistics class and i thought it was worth reading",1
This book isn't always easy to read (I usually read novels) but it gives .... This book isn't always easy to read (I usually read novels) but it gives lots of food for thought. The first time I read it was about 5 years ago and it stuck in my mind so I'm reading it again.,1
"Good Value. Ship Faster and the book looks like a new. Just cover edge little bit bent, inside was good. Good value",1
Fantasticky interesting. East to read.,1
"Why are some people successful and others are not?. This highly readable books examines the roots of success, and debunks a lot of common misperceptions. The examples are fascinating, particularly the research done on the ""best"" athletes in Canadian hockey.<br /><br />The basic point from this book is that the best are not always the most successful. Generally, people get to be successful at something as a result of circumstances which in several example has to do with the timing of a person's birth.<br /><br />""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.""",1
"Amazing Book. This is a terrific book written by an Outlier himself, who is born of outliers.",1
"Must Read. This book is just amazing. Gladwell gives an insightful and inspired look at what it took for some of the worlds greatest lawyers, hockey players, and tech moguls to succeed at the earliest levels of their careers.",1
"Smashed it!. Absolutely awesome time reading this. clear, concise and interesting. I would read again for sure",1
Great Book by Malcolm Gladwell. After reading this book i brought all other books that are written by him,1
Excellent. A great book. Gladwell hones in on aspects I have rarely thought about. First rate writing.,1
"10,000 steps. I loved reading this book! Learning about the 10,000 steps or 10,000 hours impacted me. The more we do something, the closer we are to becoming an expert. Persistence pays off. But you need time. A book worth reading!",1
"Four Stars. enjoy the authors research and writing, excellent book, will read more from him",1
Different look at success. Interesting perspective on the analysis of success and successful people. A reminder to look at the big picture when making choices.,1
Interesting read. Food for thought on what makes some people more successful than other.,1
Alternative explanation of success. You didn't success because of you alone. It's the result of the community and culture you are immersed in. It's the opportunity to work hard that makes it even possible.,1
"great book. This book is a real eye-opener and gives a different perspective on how we look at things, especially achievement and children's accomplishments. It has some great ideas for grouping children that make a good deal of sense. Unlikely the 'system' will be listening, unfortunately. As an educator, I can see how his ideas would work to students' advantage.",1
"I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",0
"great book. Great reading, It will widen your horizon and see things in different perspective.",1
A great handbook!. A great tool and daily guide in one's journey to success! It's also an awesome repository of methods and strategies for success.,1
Four Stars. Interesting and very different.,1
Five Stars. Very interesting and eye opening. Takes conventional wisdom and shows the fallacy of popular beliefs.,1
"Thought-provoking and entertaining. Gladwell does it again, only this time he lays the foundation for understanding why certain people achieve more in life than others that may have had similar circumstances. His stories and data energize thoughts that make you wonder about your own upbringing and that of your children. He offers suggestions on how we can improve our progeny and grant them the opportunities needed to become the stuff of this book -- an outlier. Highly recommend this fun and thought-provoking book!",1
"Focus is Necessary. Malcolm Gladwell is a modern day genius. His research is impeccable and his presentation, moving. The amount of information placed in each chapter is substantial and there are multiple different stories included in each chapter to paint an image of the principal presented. The variety of stories, from well known celebrities to lesser-known communities, adds a three-dimensional texture to the overwhelming truth of the substance shared. I continually felt ideas and inspirations that I wanted to implement in my life or in my children's lives that could help set one up for success. Gladwell does not hold back from his message he wants to convey, rather, he tells it as it is and avoids any mitigation, which he discusses later in the book. The layout of the book is revelatory. Everything links together and leads to an ultimate story, which I shan't revel to save the surprise for potential readers/listeners. I love this book. This writing is very applicable to all. I hope you can use it in your life like I plan to and mine.",1
"One of the best books I've read. One of the best books I've read. I absolutely love the conclusions he draws, though he takes a little bit of liberty with his interpretation of the data. I totally agree with what he says, though. Inspiring, uplifting, and incredibly interesting. You do not want to miss this one.",1
"Outliers is Amazing. I found Gladwell's ""Outliers"" as wonderful as his other books, ""Blink"" and ""The Tipping Point."" As usual, Gladwell takes the reader through a thought process that allows wonder and information to coexist. I gave this book to my brother for Christmas (after reading it myself) and he told me that his copy is now on it's fourth reader.",1
Fantastic stories and reality punch. Good for those who think that Rome was built in one day and intelligence is enough to succed,1
"Changing the way the world understands itself, one person at a time.. Malcolm Gladwell has something important to say. He makes an elegant case, employs agreeable logic, and is a colorful story-teller. Even if you disagree with his primary arguments, you will surely enjoy the craft of his artisans' prose, and learn something new.",1
well written book. This book was very interesting to read. I enjoyed reading about things from a different prospective. I am reading another book from this authur.,1
"A must read particularly for young generations. Very interesting book. I am happy that I came across it. The book had my full attention till it started about the story in Jamaica. I could understand that such story is close to the author. However, I would have preferred more examples that are not directly linked to the author. Nevertheless, I can understand the author being proud of his origins. From my humble point of view, I recommend the book.",1
"Eye opening. This book goes deeper inside the nature vs. nurture, predestination vs free will argument more comprehensibly than any other book or scholar I have ever come into contact with. Malcolm Gladwell shows that success is a combination of luck and fate as well as development of skill and practice. If one is born into dire circumstances, will they succeed? Is fostering a talent more important that taking a abnormal interest in a subject the key to success? This book is a must have for a western civilization preoccupied with what the deserve over what they should work for.",1
Five Stars. Very Entertaining!,1
My personal review. What the author did with the book is what i liked about it.For example is where he tells us how the date of birth determines if you are going to be good in sports. Another example is where IQ isn't about everything you need to be smart. Like i was saying with the IQ it just doesn't always require an high IQ to be smart for example a layer you just don't need a hi IQ buts also a fast moving thinker so you can back up the defendant.,1
"Success decoded (kinda). Loved the book -Malcolm finds patterns in successful people and presents them quite nicely in an easily digestible way. I do however feel like all the people he discusses fit the ideas that he believes in. Would've been nice to also include 'outliers' that don't fit his proposed system and explore commonalities there. Overall, a good informative book!",1
"great all around. a great author with a sharp mind and a wonderful performance reading it. plenty here to consider in your own life, your kids lives, and the current environment of politics pushing the idea of american greatness. can't recommend more as a great read and listen.",1
New perspective on success. The book was amazing! Very well written and an overall great read. I walked away from this book with a new outlook on success and the good fortune my life has provided me. Can't wait to read a few more of Goldwell's books.,1
Outliers The Story of Success. It was an amazing book that help explain some of the greatest success stories of all time. It also explains why somethings happen. Why do planes crash? Why are Asians better at math? All these questions are answered in this book. Everyone should read this book. If you have children you should read it twice.,1
"Lack of a full tie-in. The stories through this book were great and very informative; however, the author only did a roughly 5 minute tie-in at the end of the book showing how all of the stories stated previously in the book come together. Instead of going into mass amounts of detail per story (although they were intriguing) I feel like there should’ve been more time devoted to describing what the book is about, rather than what the stories were about.",1
loved it!. used for a class ... loved it!,1
"Psychology of Success. The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born. These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.",1
Five Stars. Item as described and fast delivery,1
"Wife's book club reading. I have no idea about its worth. Even if it were for me, I probably wouldn't have read it in a couple of days. Why do they post these evaluations, on books, especially, so soon after delivery?",1

"interesting. very interesting concept, i liked this book a lot",1
Such a good book!. I was required to read this for AP lang but I liked it so much I ended up buying another copy for my boyfriend :),1
Good read!. Good book and daughter enjoyed the story.,1
Great story telling... Dangerous Scince. If you like cherry great stories that fit a narrative you're really going to love this book. It's not without truth.. But don't expect to be convinced of the author's purpose.,1
"Right Place Right Time?. Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers reads as a provocative new interpretation of the foundations of success. As the reader pages through his numerous examples of seemingly heroic success stories who in fact owe their fortune and fame to circumstance, that reader is tempted to toss aside all previous assumptions about the roots of individual merit.",1
Five Stars. I've read this book multiple times and recommend it to anyone and everyone.,1
"kinda boring. high expectation for this book, but after reading half the book, i stopped. I felt like things were jumping around and many things are already obvious to me",1
"This is one of those books that give popular nonfiction a bad name. Which is unfortunate, because what could be better than books that both educate and entertain? But Outliers embodies everything that people who sneer at the genre are talking about: its conclusions are both obvious and simplistic, its writing persuasive but glib. It’s easy to see why Gladwell is a popular author: he’s a good storyteller, his writing accessible and entertaining. But this book is so riddled with oversimplified con",0
Great condition.. It seems people are only reviewing the actual story not the product. I bought the paper back and it’s in great condition.,1
A great reas. Addicting and a marvelous story telling with great research. Hat's off to an aurhor on pulling it all together beautifully,1
Needs better glue. Great book! But some of the pages fell out over time,1
"Very fun book!. This is a book that talks very well about a topic that everyone likes to read about, which is how to be the best! Malcom did a great job writing this and putting together his theory on why are the best just the best on what they do.",1
"Great Book!. First off, the supplier did a good job shipping the book in time and in good condition.",1
"Colleen's Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, fter reading your book, ""The Outliers"" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success. The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom. The Matthew Effect"", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would"" plan ahead"", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! The 10,000 Hour Rule"" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the ""10,000 hours"" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? n ""The Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", I learned that the three key points to",1
"Excellent use of examples and data. This nonfiction piece was the required reading for students taking AP Language in the fall at our local high school. I read it so I could work with a young girl I mentor.As a former high school English teacher, I found it very engaging- a difficult task for non fiction writers. My teen reader also liked it.",1
intriguing. fascinating ties into cultural/societal topics. my open-mind grew just that much more. great stuff. thanks,1
"Interesting read. As any book written by a former journalist it is peppered with sensationalism. Whilst much of the book was interesting and readable, as a researcher I found some of his findings questionable at best. And like any good journalist he focuses on sensationalizing.",1
Me.. It sucks so far...,0
A recommendation for Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. This book was an assigned reading for my 10th grade daughter and we read it together. It was a very interesting look at factors which play a part in phenomenal success and experiences. There is a great amount of science which backs up what is presented here and this book lays it out in a way which is interesting and accessible.,1
"highly recommend. Outliers affirmed some of my personal theories regarding success and what makes or breaks people on their way. On the other hand, the research and personal stories were both fascinating and eye opening. I would definitely recommend this book for those who work in the field of education, but it is a good read for almost anyone who wants to learn.",1
"A mentor lent me this book, I really enjoyed it.. Had to get a copy for myself.",1

Enlighting!. Very interesting book. It makes you look at the world in a whole new light. This is the first book I have read of Malcolm Gladwell but I don't think it will be the last.,1
"Not a self-help book. Story jumped from random study to random study, without cohesive thought. The conclusion wise you are a product of your environment and experiences, Plus the work you put into it.

Buy it!. Love this book - explains the difference between what makes someone successful to the T,1

I expected more. The writing drags on and one cannot help but push through some sections that drag on monotonously.,1
Amazing. Was a great product was a big plus for my gym experience if you buy would like me to try any more prouducts and give you reviews on instagram or YouTube I can help you out with that. @Albertom5969 or amateos@ycp.edu,1
Eye opening. Very insightful and thought provoking. Never have looked at successful people this way before. A lot of good explanations on why those that are successful are where they are today.,1
required reading. High school students and educators! Should be read the moment a woman knows she is having a baby! Everyone in society. Career class use it as curriculum!!!!! Life changing. Sad I didn't read this 30 years ago!!!!,1

"Not my cup of tea. If you are looking for a page turner, this is not it. I had to read this for school and I couldn’t absorb anything because I kept spacing out",0
"Awesone this book is a must. Undestand how & why succesful people achieve their goals and why the rest don’t, and much more. Truly awesone findings, 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼",1
"Food for Thought... and Action. I really enjoyed and benefited from this eye opening, thought provoking work By Malcolm Gladwell. Outliers points out how the environment of one's family, and/or community invariably influences one's potential for mega success. It provokes me to heighten my awareness and purposefulness to expand opportunity for greater circles as well as for my most immediate circle. he book stimulated me to consider strategies I might employ to facilitate my continued growth and success as well. It can do the same for you. It certainly offers insights that could lead to crafting a legacy for those you love. If you have a dream and a powerful work ethic, your potential for success is multiplied by the culture that surrounds you. While we may not choose our birth circumstance, we can certainly immerse ourselves in the world of our passions. The sooner the better. It all makes since.",1
"Amazing insight into the sum total of factors that make successful people successful. This book puts it for all to see that success is not only a result of individual effort, but the sum total of many factors that make it impossible for a person to be a self made success. It helps understand how we can clone many more Bill Gates, Steve Jobs from first principles (what really made them successes). It's almost like the reverse engineering of success. Finding out the process from the product. It's one of my best reads ever!",1
"The X- Factors of Success. Talent is both overrated and underrated. The fact is this book uncovers just how luck and hard work account more for becoming successful than talent itself. Having said that, we also learn that talent is often squandered due to cultural and systemic restraints. Eye opening and fascinating to say the least!",1
"I¿m a big fan of Gladwell¿s books, and Outliers has not disappoi. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s books, and Outliers has not disappointed.  It follows in the steps of his other books, illustrating interesting social phenomena in a way that is compelling.  I found the book fascinating and difficult to put down, and especially loved the focus on the fact that we tend to look at success far to simplistically and prefer to congratulate ourselves for achieving success with &amp;ldquo;hard work&amp;rdquo; rather than being thankful for the circumstances that led to the success.",1
"you may be able to better control and change them to foster success. Definitely changes your perspective on success by demystifying outliers and explaining the conditions and opportunities that lead them to where they are now. If you can identify these conditions in your life, you may be able to better control and change them to foster success.",1
My first Gladwell!. The research done for Outliers was very thorough and allows one to think differently about success.,1
"Better/best. This was my best read in a long time. I like the ones that give us something to think about, and I thought about this for a long time.",1
"Gladwell again provides a new perspective on common wisdom. Gladwell's books continue to take a subject based in ""common wisdom"" and flip it over to find the surprises dwelling underneath. He did that in the ""Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"" and he again does it here.",1
Started off great then fell off a bit. Book started off great then fell off a bit. The first 150 pages or so was about relatable topics then it got into stuff that I didn't really care about. Very interesting premise and I will read Gladwell's other books.,1
Greatly performed. Hard work and circumstances is the take always from this book.,1
Great Read. It was a great read and really had me thinking about a lot of life situations and they can either advance or hinder life opportunities.,1
Great for Managers. I’m a call center manager for a large tech company and I just loved this book. It gave me some great new insights on how the little things can turn into big advantages.,1
"Unique Perspective. Love Gladwell's perspective on human and social issues. Very interesting insights here, esp for anyone who's ever felt that they somehow missed the boat on success and aren't sure why!",1
"Four Stars. I am really enjoying reading it at the moment, very interesting. Worth buying.",1
Five Stars. Great book. Very revealing of some very interesting facts,1
"Average book. It's not average in terms of other books, but I've read much better from Gladwell. Would recommend nonetheless based on merit of ideas",1
"The Outliers - It's more than creative genius. I found ""Outliers"" to be a highly informative, useful, and entertaining follow-on to ""The Tipping Point,"" another terrific book by Gladwell.  His basic theme is that when judging an extraordinarily successful individual, you have to look beyond his or her own background and achievement to the surrounding ""elements"" such as family, friends, years of practice, and setting. Invariably, the confluence of circumstances and individual effort are behind what may superficially appear to be a typical rags to riches success story. It could serve as an inspiration to young people who might recognize similarities between the examples in the book and their own circumstances.",1
"Master Your Passion With Investment of Time or Practice. This is a fast read. And it was provocative on the number of hours invested to become a master of something. I enjoyed hearing about all the hours the Beatles performed in Hamburg, Germany to master their art. And finally, Gladwell personalizes the story with his mother's history and journey.",1
"His best so far, IMHO. Great book. Makes you think. Very easy to read.",1
"developing a new worldview. gladwell destroys the concept of inherent abilities. as a black man this is important because we have been told for 400 years that we are genetically inferior in intelligence. Gladwell's study indicates that the intelligence factor plays far less a role than many other factors such as time spent on a skill, education, and one's cultural environment. his work is going to have a tremendous effect on the education of children. it will also lead many parents to place more emphasis on intervening in their children's development, especially in having them learn special skills at an early age. we know that tiger woods began playing golf as a toddler. parents will begin taking this concept more seriously than before. black parents will also begin to understand the relationship of culture to their worldview and resultant behavior, especially what they are teaching their children on a subliminal level. it is very critical reading for those of us who live in the black communities of america. this book will spawn tremendous activity and research.many more books will be written because of it.",1
Gifted. Sent as a gift,1
"Excellent read. I bought this book originally as a result of the Asian airlines accident in San Francisco. I found the cultural insight as to what went on in the cockpit fascinating. As a pilot, I know that two pilot operations are inherently more safe than a single pilot. I will not be flying any Asian airlines anytime in the future! This book appears to be well researched and thought out, I learned quite a bit having read this. The book became drawn out at the end. It unnecessarily went over same material discussed earlier in the book.",1
"Fascinating. While some of my book group thought it was a bunch of ""hogwash"", I thought at the very least, it was thought provoking.",1
Five Stars. Incredibly insightful and thought provoking.,1
"Insightful, fascinating and well-written. I judge a book .... Insightful, fascinating and well-written. I judge a book on how much of it I feel compelled to read aloud to my long-suffering wife. My wife was extensively exposed to this one.",1
Five Stars. Good,1
Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,1
"Great Book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It provided a great deal of insight into how people are shaped by many things including but not limited to their environment, socioeconomic status, educational access/history, and other areas that are not always acknowledged when we look at an individual's success.",1
compelling. actually wasnt the book I was looking for but stuck with it for a good read!,1
Great book. Great book,1
"Excellent Condition!. I ordered this book to save money for college and it worked!! My book arrived in excellent condition, just in time for me to head off to school. I felt like I bought it brand new off the shelf. I'm definitely doing this again next semester. :)",1
Excellent Novel. This book really illuminated a lot of truths about life to me. I've always had this mindset of working hard but also bring interdependent and needing to take advantage of any good situation. This book strengthened that view and showed me a world of numbers I was completely blind to. I've already recommended it to a few friends.,1
Five Stars. a vital read for anyone who doubts their own ability to succeed.....just got to keep on keepin' on,1
Really makes you think. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It really make you think about what it takes to be successful.,1
"Great Book, May check out more. This book was a different read. It took me a while to get into the the concepts. My favorite is the 10,000 hrs. However I would say it takes 10,000 to master a craft.",1
"A quick read. I found this to be a very interesting view on success and successful people. The author has a very unique way of bringing forth the 'right time-right place' expression. He also provided amazing visuals within his stories, and the differences between how we are raised and where we come from. Please do remember, that having old, family money or looking good still has its advantages.",1
"""Outliers"" should be required reading for high school students, their parents, and their teachers. Excellent book!. Anyone who feels they haven't achieved the life they sought should read this book. It provides ample evidence that hard work and grasping any opportunity that arises will most likely result in success.",1
"A Real Eye Opener. What an amazing book. I didn't expect this much from a book that I had to read as a part of assignment, but the book proved to be something that could change the way you see life. Everything in the book, from its organization to its examples comes together so well that Outliers becomes a must read.",1
"000 hour rule' was amazing.. Very interesting.. Specially the '10,000 hour rule' was amazing.",1
"There’s More In Everyone Of Us!. Malcom Gladwell has crafted a masterpiece by utilizing the beauty of long-term data analysis. A culmination of connections, often too subtle to notice. Small things matter! Kudos to Malcolm for this invigorating insight into the realization of the moment.",1
Very interesting. Great narrator and very interesting content. Really makes you think twice about success and may motivate you to better yourself,1
outliers 101. Interesting fun read. As usual Gladwell seems to drift from the subject at hand. He rambles aimlessly about something that just popped into his head and tries to make you beleive he knows what he is talking about.,1
"worth the listen!. so much content in this book, just listen! one of the best books available today.",1
Good. Great book to read,1
Genius. I love anything that he does and this one did not disappoint. read if you want to see the great success stories differently.,1
"Secrets of Success. Although the author may have made some sweeping generalities in his pursuit of discovering the secrets of successful people, he writes in a most entertaining and persuasive style. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",1
Worth a listen and a good classic.. This book dives deep into the untold areas of how the greats were in the right place at the right time. Helps me reflect on similar situations that may have cause some of the things I am exceptional at.,1
Five Stars. Excellent read! Recommend ing it to all!,1
"Interesting, easy to read. Not as good as Blink, but worth the read. Some boring pages now and then, but mostly engaging and well-written.",1
"Great Wisdom. One of the most thought provoking books of our time. Important read for parents, leaders and educators. Success is connected with hard work. Loved the true examples and thought provoking life stories. True life is better than fiction! Must read!",1
Five Stars. If you like detail,1
"enthralling. changed my outlook on the world completely, i read this around four years ago, but finally decided to reread it, but yes it still has impact",1
A Must read!!. The author gives us a very insightful perspective on how we look at success in our society. The book gives us a more in depth look at how advantages and opportunities play a major role in success.,1
"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them. Here's a good rule of thumb about Outliers: if you are even vaguely interested in reading this book, you should definitely give it a go!",1
"Excellent Read, Freshman-College level required reading. Have you ever wondered why some people make it and some people don't? Malcolm Gladwell exams this question through interviews with many persons",1
"Amazing Book. Phenomenal book with amazing insights. I would recommend it to anyone with a deep desire to build success, especially in the communities they live in.",1
"An Unusual Book. What a great book! It is an unusual look at the circumstances surrounding success. The author highlights some characteristics and circumstances that most people would never consider, no less associate. He comes to some rather astounding conclusions about people, their cultural backgrounds, and their ability to succeed. While it is a scientific truism that association does not prove causation, Gladwell makes a strong case for his hypotheses about successful people.",1
Four Stars. Good!,1
Excellent read!. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read this book and see things from a perspective that I had never considered. Very interesting points are brought forth in this text. A must read!!,1
Three Stars. ok,1
Five Stars. great product fast shipping!,1
"Interesting anaylis of how the great became great. I recommend hearing it more then once to separate the forest from the trees in terms of how it relates to success, and outliers.",1
"Perfect for High School English class. Dear Mr. Gladwell, In our Senior English class, the essential question we are analyzing is, ""To what extent does time and place define a person?"" We have been basing topics and ideas to revolve around this question and analyzing how it does define a person. Therefore, we read your novel, Outliers in which you explain how these factors impact one's success or one's failures through descriptive stories about real life people. Most of the examples portray how time and place can provide opportunities that can lead to a successful life, allowing them to become an ""outlier"". But I believed that three chapters stood out from the rest that seemed the most interesting. In the chapter, ""The 10,000 Hour Rule"", the fact that most professionals had practiced at least a total of 10,000 hours on their talent was fascinating. Practicing a total of 10,000 hours seemed to be the common theme in this chapter because all of the skilled people had that or more while the lesser lacked the same amount of practice. I also agree with this logic because it seems that many people may start out with a bit more of an advantage, but the dedication to strive to become better ultimately separates the skilled from the unskilled. I was also curious to know if there have been any exceptions to this rule, such as a professional pianist who has only had 7,000 hours of practice, but performs just as well as someone with 10,000 hours. Another chapter that was interesting was, ""The Trouble with Geniuses Part II"", which included two different geniuses that had opposite lives because of a skill required through one's environment called practical intelligence. You would expect any genius to master that skill, no matter the cause, but it was Oppenheimer who used this skill to manipulate a situation, while Langan could not. Also, I agree with the results of the study about the lives of wealthier families and poorer families and how it impacts their practical intelligence, because the wealthier parents seem to allow their children to be more independent. After reading Oppenheimer's story, I was curious to know what he said that was so persuasive that allowed him to be excused from jail. Lastly, the chapter, ""Three Lessons of Joe Flom"", was another interesting section about how time really presents opportunities. Flom's cases at the time were considered minor until businesses seized to control one another, which made his cases extremely important and current. Time seems to be the gateway that allowed Flom to become successful. I agree with your logic that some disadvantages could be one's opportunities for success, which is portrayed through the life of Joe Flom. Although, I do wonder if there are many others like Flom because his scenario seems rare. Furthermore, I also enjoyed reading the chapter, ""Rice Paddies and Math Test"", since it related to my own life. I've always viewed my math skills as excellent solely because I was Chinese, but now I understand that many factors contribute to this talent, such as the work ethic of my people. But, although I am Chinese, I do not use the Chinese language so the words are not quicker, which still does not allow me to understand why I am more advanced than others at this subject. Overall, I loved the way you described these situations and how they correlate with our essential question. Sincerely, David Dang",1
Another way of looking at the world. Another fascinating book by Malcolm Gladwell who manages to see what the rest of us see but to analyze it in an entirely new light. Worth the read.,1
"ok book.. Interesting stories for sure. But, it just seems seems to me that compared to ""the tipping point"" Gladwell's books are just not that good anymore. I've read blink and outliers after reading tipping point and they are just not that good in comparison.",1
"Achieves Eureka Status. Gladwell's gift is to to take what you know and twist it on its head. He takes pleasure in making you see that the ""truths"" you have believed are not true. What is counterintuitive is often what is true. The hidden becomes revealed. He gives the reader many ""wow"" moments. I bought all his other books because of reading ""Outliers"".",1
"Cherry-picking. I was not convinced by this book's thesis, and found its use of evidence highly selective and convenient rather than compelling and balanced. It is a very entertaining book, and very easy to read, with lots of interesting bits and pieces in it that are enjoyable, but as a theory it is not much more than a fun idea.",0
"Great book!. This was really fascinating and I found myself not only thinking about the ideas Mr. Gladwell brought up, but discussing them with others as well. I bought the audio book version to listen to on my drive to and from work and actually found myself looking forward to my commute each day! Great book!",1
Great book. Great book. Fast reading and incredibly interesting. Loved it! Full of history and sociology my two loves. Highly recommend to all students of society.,1
Awesome.. Great book with a lot of interesting insight. Outliers will definitely make you think about success and what it takes to get to the top.,1
"very enjoy. this book illustrates the simple theory with vivid stories, very enjoy reading",1
"Everyone should read this.. Mr Galdwell, lays out specifically why some of our greatest Icon's succeed where others do not.",1
"Good read. Great book, it gives a good perspective on why and how the Bill Gates of the world got to where they were. The story telling makes it easy to understand and very reader friendly.",1
An Interesting Concept. I like that this book is not a self-help book. It's message is not to change yourself... but to be yourself at the right time.,1
"Five Stars. Excellent, thought provoking book at a fantastic price!",1
"Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",1
"Everyone needs this book. easy to listen, well told and worth the time and money investment. This book provides much needed perspective to those seeking a better understanding of the world.",1
Good buy from AMAZON !. Good buy from AMAZON !,1
"A must read!. Eye opening relative revelations about age, demographics, religion, timing and luck as contributors toward success But, the common denominator is hard work. This is a great read, especially if you have young children because a parent can influence their child's success.",1
Five Stars. Loved this book!!,1
"Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatl. If you've ever heard people say, ""You gotta put in 10,000 hours into something before you're an expert."" Chances are they read Outliers. Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatles. The stories and the social science behind them is fascinating and Gladwell's prose makes it an easy, liquid-like read. For people who like to think and want to know how things work, this book is for you.",1
"CDs were Ok. I gave this 2 stars only because the CDs were fine. The case was torn, bent and misshapen.",0
Excellent and Refreshing Look at Research and Hidden Stories and Trends. Excellent book. Had many principles I was able to look at in more depth after for graduate work. He makes some very interesting points about how outliers in data analysis and observation can actually be potentially new trends or tell the story for which the researcher is really looking. He talks about the 10K hour rule and how successes can be discovered. Classic Malcolm Gladwell. I've read it several times now.,1
Fascinating research woven like a novel. I wish this was required reading for high school. So many interesting peoples down circumstances pulled into fascinating revelations from research.,1
Wonderful book and narrated well.. Very much enjoyed Outliers. To me it is always interesting and educational to learn the “root of the history of events. Great read.,1
Interesting. This book is very interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend it to educators and parents.,1
Read It!. One of the most fascinating books ever published-amazing amount and scope of information in an entertaining and interesting format. It is among the top 5 books I have ever read,1
"Wonderful read. Great, unique perspective on success. I do worry though that it might make crazy parents even crazier raising their kids.",1
"Very Interesting Theories. Good book with interesting thoughts on race., opportunity and hard work . The year born theory is especially perplexing.",1
"Interesting and Inspiring. I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.",1
Buy it!. Love this book - explains the difference between what makes someone successful to the T,1
Inspiring book. Easy to listen. Ideas are persuasive and well supported with examples. I enyojed the book and will repeat some parts to think them through again.,1
Awesome book to listen. it was a really good book. It was a big surprise in the end about what the point was really about. made me look in myself and tell myself to be hard working and help others.,1
Will change your thinking for the better. This book will change how you view the situations you encounter and improve the strategies you develope for them. Must read for any leader.,1
"Excellent book. Worth reading, highly recommended, great examples of how human persistence, hard work nad luck are much more important than sheer intelligence.",1
Great book. A good listen. He definitely puts our ideologies to the test and explains his theory and follows it up with interesting facts to back it up.,1
"Good read, but does not challenge the foundations. Being an outlier means being a non-conformist. One hears this kind of advice all the time. So many people buy into conventions that they forget the reasons behind the conventions.",1
An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be .... Really interesting pop psychology/sociology. An easy read with lots of anecdotes/stats that you will be regurgitating down the pub later.,1
Well written and thought provoking.. Interesting read. Some of the points made are common sense but this books makes a good analysis of what successful people have in common. Definitely worth the time.,1
A great book by Gladwell... Worth buying!!. It's a book which gripped my attention...,1
"True Stories of Success and How Our History has Created Them.. Malcolm Gladwell breaks down the lives of multiple people or companies that were or are currently successful. Gladwell dissects the background and history of these success stories and thoroughly analyzes the ways in which they appear. Gladwell brings up successes such as Bill Gates and The Beatles, creating the idea that although they might be above average in their select field, their remarkable success comes from pure dedication to their passion and a hint of ""demographic luck."" I quite enjoyed this book, it sheds light on a new perspective that claims that successful stories may be outstanding and irregular, but the circumstances these successes arise in are also highly irregular. The stories described in Outliers helps put my life and ideas into a broader spectrum that pertains to everyday people working hard towards their goal who find themselves in exactly the right place at the right time.",1
"Fair perspective backed with solid research. Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting guy. This book was an easy read, and worthwhile. While I believe the author overempathsizes the effects of privilage and background, I think his nase perspective that these are contributors to success is valid. Good book for anyone who leans right to read and openly consider.",1
"Good read. The book was great. It was delivered on time and come in perfect condition. Very interesting to read the little stories in it, quite eye opening. Overall I would recommend this book to others that all looking for a little something different than a regular fiction book.",1
Five Stars. Good Book,1
"Excellent, it opens your mind and gives you a .... Excellent, it opens your mind and gives you a different approach of what ""the road of success"" is. Supported by statistical data and anthropological analysis. I'm satisfied with the book. Totally recomended.",1
"Good Food For Thought. Outliers is an interesting expansion of the theme that people are generally a product of their environments. Have you ever wondered why some people are exceptional at their professions more so than others? This book offers a few interesting theories in addition to hard work and practice. An interesting theme with at least a few important points to take away, at a minimum it will give you something to think about.",1
"Success - Defined as so much more than any individual alone can determine.. I found this book presents a different and interesting way to look at what contributes to success. This makes you realize that there is so much more to what determines how we become who we are, the chances that we have access to based on so much more than we realize. It provides a broadening of perspective and a thought provoking larger world view as it applies to each and every one of us.",1
Outliers book. Loved the book. I sent extra one to 16-year-old grandson and he loved it too. Now we spent time on phone discussing book. Love it!,1
Good read. Great read,1
Outliers. Thought it was good. Made me think about my own life and certain advantages I have had. Definitely recommend this book.,1
"Fact Check?. Initially I enjoyed this book, until I realized that many of the conclusions that Gladwell came to were wrong.",0
Amazing. Free books force you to consider the way you view the world like Gladwell's do. Unmatched levels of consideration couple with a knack for storytelling that make this a joy to read.,1
Gladwell's Outliers. This is a must reading for teachers and parents. It suggests we challenge our kids but not necessarily try to imitate other culture's educational practices.,1
Must read!. Great insight in how successful people have made it to where they are! This books steps away from the self made man and introduces factors that shapes a successful person. It will definitely open different point of views!,1
Four Stars. Good Book,1
Four Stars. Interesting insgiht around success,1
"Excellent book if you want to take out excuses. Excellent book if you want to take out excuses of your way. I like it because talks about success in other perspectives, and gives you more confidence in your potential.",1
"Outliers: The Story of Success, with a successful shipment. I received my order only 5 days after I purchased it, which was quicker than expected. I also received emails letting me know that my purchase was made and when my order was shipped. It came in the best quality, wrapped and in perfect condition. I wouldn't have chosen anyone else to buy from.",1
Best book of the many books from Malcolm Gladwell. This book is so good I was not able to put it down. I read it over the course of one weekend. That is not normally my reading pattern and I recommend it to anyone interested in human behavior.,1
"Great Comparisons. I really liked the data that Mr Gladwell compiled! It was very interesting to see all these successful men and how there are similarities with them- age, birthdays, etc. For example, Why are most Hockey players born between Jan and March? Get the book to find out!",1
Five Stars. Great read!,1
"Only half the story. Gladwell does identify a series of external forces that shape our chess chances of success. There are things outside of our control the greatly affect our outcomes, but that's not the whole story. The missing half is the individual's responsibility for seeking out the set of circumstances and opportunities unique to his time and place. We may inherit fertile soil, but it is our responsibility to find what grows and plow the field.",1
BEST BOOK EVER!. I had to buy this book for a college course and I didn't have any idea what it was about but after just getting through the first 10 pages I was hooked!! I didn't want to finish it because it was that good! It makes you think about how life presents you opportunities and if you are willing to realize that is happening then the truth will not be with held from you.,1
"Excellent - It will make you think.. This book is different from the type of book I usually read but I really enjoyed the book. Outliers is a book about the reasons some people are successful in life or not successful. The date when a person is born, the 10,000 hour rule, Jewish lawyers and their success in the 70's and 80's, air plane pilots and the country in which they were born are all some of the outliers which the author discusses in full. What the book really does is make you look at your own life and wonder how your successes and failures are tied to things in which you had no control. I strongly urge everyone to read this book. It will keep your interest and make you think.",1
"Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right. I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",1
Five Stars. met exspectations,1
Interesting and thought provoking. Pulling together multiple strands of experience and narrative into a single whole is done well. I certainly hadn't quite realised the extent to which our dates of birth affect life chances of individuals.,1
"Great!. Really enjoyed this, especially because Malcolm narrated his own writing. Makes you think. Many names mentioned which lead to further information, research, etc. Fun conversation starter too.",1
"Another niche product by Gladwell, the master. Gladwell is like that old gent on SIXTY MINUTES who finds much meaning in details or events the rest of us might overlook. Want to know how to succeed? Practice, practice, practice!",1
One of the most fascinating books I have ever read!. This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It essentially disproves the romantic notion that a person's hard work and perseverance overcame any and all obstacles and their achievements are entirely of their own accord with no luck and no help from anyone else. Malcolm Gladwell gracefully weaves through a wide variety of topics ranging from Canadian Junior Hockey to Bill Gates to New York City's late 19th century garment industry to show how outliers thrived in their time and place.,1
"Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking. Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking, giving you insight into a multitude of different factors that contribute to success that society often over looks. The book itself was in perfect condition.",1
"Another book by Gladwell. Naturally a similar writing style from ""Made to Stick"". It had it's catch all points. Nothing earth shattering, but easy reading",1
All time favorite. Great book. Read it cover to cover in one sitting,1
A really interesting read. An insightful book that makes you think. It's not a guide for life but it is interesting as a parent to give you more motivation to look for and use all opportunities that come along in life for your child. It's an easy read - not too heavy but definitely thought-provoking.,1
GOOD READ!. Book came on time and in a good condition. I loved reading this book! Author is a genius. It is about factors of success in America.Such an eye opener.,1
Great book. Interesting book. Well written. Good ideas.,1
Cody. Boring,1
"Forced. I loved ""Blink"" and ""Tipping Point"", but ""Outliers"" fell short of what I expect from Gladwell. Not only did the book ramble along seemingly without much thought given to organization, but I felt like Gladwell was forcing data to fit his ideas rather than researching with an open mind. Some of the information was interesting and thought-provoking and some of the book was close to boring. I found myself having to re-read passages because I had blanked out as I lost interest. The best part of reading ""Outliers"" is in comparing Gladwell's earlier writings with this effort and realizing one success does not guarantee another.",1
Five Stars. excellent,1
"Are we doomed to mediocrity?. Having completed the fascinating and awe-inspiring summary of Mr Gladwell's research, I verge on extreme depression thinking that if we are not outliers the rest of us are doomed to mediocrity. Without 10,000 hours of experience, we are merely ""also-rans"". Thus, I will continue to focus on being thankful to be running at all.",1
"Couldn't put it down. As with his other two books, The Tipping Point and Blink, I couldn't put this book down. Malcom Gladwell's writing is captivating. His ability to share information through relevant story telling is unparalleled.",1
GREAT BOOK.. Malcolm Gladwell has a unique way of looking at situations. GREAT BOOK.,1
Mind Blowing. This is on the Marine Corps reading list for a reason. The amount of mind blowing information that's enjoyable to listen is breathtaking. Will probably listen this amazing book again.,1
"Circumstance is Critical!. Brilliant book that recognizes that intelligence, talent and desire are critical but circumstance determines incredible success as much as anything!",1
"Great, But For The Narration. A long time known study about ‘its who you know, the opportunities that avail themselves, 10,000 hours and fortitude, and damn luck.’  Outliers, The Story of Success, written by Malcolm Gladwell, and narrated by him, as well. A fun read (for its content). Read it and get a better understanding of all that went well for you and that all that went poorly for you in life. The big negative is that Mr. Gladwell is not a very good narrator.",1
"Genious!. Genious!!! Tons of profound rationale! Congratulations, it shows exactly how hard work and opportunity can transform a normal person in a outlier!",1
Five Stars. Thank you for great book!,1
Opened my eyes. Malcolm Gladwell did a good job reading his own book. Outliers made me open my eyes to a different idea of success. Interested listen that I will go back to time and time again to help me reassess how I perceive success and what it takes to get there.,1
great. it was very good and insightful. It motivates me to work hard in what I love to do! thank you!,1
"Outliers: The Freakonomics of Psychology. Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an ""outlier."" The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.",1
Five Stars. A great read and a even better conversation starter!,1
Turtles. I like turtles,1
"Outliers is a Scope to a New Outlook. First off, Outliers is a great read and I think everyone from all backgrounds or professions should read it. It's more of one of those ""universal"" books. he first thing I noticed about the book is that Gladwell REALLY did his research here. It began to seem as though the book were more about statistics and reviews rather than his own opinions, however maybe I'm wrong and I was missing the big picture. The extensive amount of quotes baffles me and they all flow nicely. I really liked how Gladwell makes everything into lament's terms no matter how complicated it may be, and then he reviews over what is happening as he makes his stories out of quotes and statistics. verall, great read and an interesting book and I hope more people get a hold of it.",1
Pre-destined to fail?. Excellent analytical look at what makes people succeed (or fail). A little depressing in that he asserts that we are almost certainly doomed to fail just based on our birth date alone. Pretty interesting.,1
"Excellent.. Excellent read. Though the content is highly intelligent and chalk full of information, the book is easy to read and fun as well. Very highly recommend it.",1
"Very interesting. Interesting facts and thoughts. Though not 100% agree with the author, the ideas are still fascinating",1
"Outliers. What a great book with unexpected content and theory. Very educational, enlightening and enjoyable read. I would recommend this book highly",1
Interesting Points But Overly Broad Assertions & Racist Postulations. I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.,1
"the man never disappoints. Reading a book by Malcolm Gladwell is like sitting across the kitchen table from a sibling or a cousin who's just enough older that he's had time to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, to see the interconnections you haven't lived long enough to notice, and to lead the conversation with wit, humor, and humility. In a world of pusillanimous blatherskytes, his is a voice of reason and civility.",1
"Re-read Even Better Than the First Read. Parts of Outliers hit home for me. I am a retired psychologist who worked with children with special needs. I was born in November in the early post World War II years. Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce. I struggled until I became an adolescent. With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out. It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation. Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools. My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.",1
"Long and Drain Out, but Motivating. Long and Drain Out, but Motivating. Really helps you to understand the power of consistency",1
"Great Read. This was the first book I have read in a long time and I was amazed at how interesting it was for the most part. There was a spot during the last half of the book that was a little dull, however, I would still recommend giving this book a read.",1
"False attribution to the success of Outliers. Very good, although what lacks substantially here is how each outlier benefited more from luck than the ""10 000"" hour rule. By luck, I mean it more in the Japanese sense of the intersection of insight and opportunity. There are thousands of skilled athletes and programmers than can put in 20, 000 hours and will never become GOATs. So manage your expectations accordingly.",1
A Model for Communicating Complex Ideas in an Interesting Way. Malcolm Gladwell's genius is to write interestingly about complex ideas and show their relevance to us.,1
Five Stars. super good,1
Five Stars. Great book.,1
"Required Book Review for ENTR 300. I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected. You can also see the influences of his family in his life. His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician. Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha). Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success. Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",1
"I Recommend. I loved this book! Never boring, very interesting, gave me a new perspective on the importance of work ethic!",1
"Remarkable Work. Extremely readable, relatable and thought-provoking. The message is enlightening and inspiring. I look forward to reading Gladwell's other books.",1
"One of the best books I've read. One of the best books I've read. I absolutely love the conclusions he draws, though he takes a little bit of liberty with his interpretation of the data. I totally agree with what he says, though. Inspiring, uplifting, and incredibly interesting. You do not want to miss this one.",1
"enthralling and easy read. I hear his speeches are just as good, read only one other book of his but I'm sure I'll be back for more!",1
Fascinating. Malcolm did very well to warm up the story with the setting of the background. I was fully impressed with the study on the Korean Airlines revelations,1
Paradigm Shifting. Thoroughly impressive. Gladwell writes wonderfully and highlights the perhaps unlikely backstories of people and events we write off and successful. Very readable and throughly recommended. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't benefit from this book.,1
"Excellent!. Awesome, very informative and fun, easy to read and very powerful arguments to change the way we educate ourselves and our children",1
"Outliers is very enlightening. I've always been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books and articles,and this book is no exception. He always has a ""not so fast"" response to our preconceptions.",1
Great book!. Great book. Came in perfect condition.,1
Only OK. I was not that impressed with this book. Nothing I read was especially profound to me. I would not recommend this book.,0
quality. Good stuff,1
"Could be half as long. I did enjoy this book, but I found it a bear to finish. Gladwell starts to make his point in the first chapter and then just beats you over the head with it until the end. He is very thorough, to the point where I felt my intelligence was being insulted. Half way into the book o audibly said ""okay, I get it."" Less historical story telling and more application of his idea would have been great.",1
"But if you know how to interpretate the concepts you will be fine, there is a lot critical thinking involved so .... This book is full of questions. But if you know how to interpretate the concepts you will be fine, there is a lot critical thinking involved so this will be an intense book but is worth it.",1
Great book! Interesting read. Excellent book! I loved it and great deal here on amazon,1
A True Definition of Success. This is the best book I've read so far this year. An astounding definition of success. From the very beginning to the goal.,1
Five Stars. Malcolm Gladwell's books are always entertaining.,1
"wonderfully written. I started with doubt and skepticism, but ended in agreement. I enjoyed it immensely.",1
just read it. Just read this book and you will understand why it is great. Very informative and unbiased in every way. Brilliant.,1
"Entertaining and fun, but not compelling. Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style. His writing is beautiful. The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read. The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision. In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme. In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).",1
"You May Be Changed After Reading This Book. It is apparent in this day and age that ""ego"" and ""self-made men"" are still intertwined. Moreover, ""success"" is still defined by many",1
"Five Stars. new, very pleased",1
"Will Smith brought me here. I initially read this book because of Will Smith. This book started off rough for me because I felt bombarding by stats. I soon began to see that Gladwell was proven his theory. Although, I found the research amazing and valuable I wasn't sure what (I) should do with it. Until the very end where he brings it all full circle and that's my only criticism. I wish the utility of the information given was stated sooner. Still a great book.",1
"Good Read. This book was an interesting read with a lot of though provoking premises. I was a little less mind blown than I'd hoped to be, but it was still very interesting.",1
Wanted More !. Great Read! I ended the book wanting more from Gladwell. Amazing story and storytelling in this book!,1
"Thinking Differently about Successful People. I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories. Christine Brown-Quinn,The Female Capitalist (TM), Author of Step Aside Super Woman...Career & Family is for Any Woman.",1
"Get Insude Outliers!. From Junior Hockey in Canada, to programming with Bill Gates and Paul Allen, to the crew of a passenger jet headed for the side of a mountain, Outliers is a must read for anyone in business.<br /><br />If you want to be successful, Outliers should definitely be on your bookshelf. The book presents a series of unrelated groups and events with a consistent theme of right place, right time.<br /><br />It is an easy read not filled with statistics and technical jargon. Yet, the book takes on a life of its' own and flows from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell's ability to research a topic and then present it in a clear, understandable format makes this a great read from cover to cover. I plan on adding Blink and Tipping Point to my reading list!",1
"So interesting, it could be a novel. Outliers is a must read for anyone who enjoys outside the box material. It certainly makes you think. After I finished it, I spoke for 2 hours with the friend who recommended it. I finished it in 2 days with a pencil in my hand so I could underline parts that I felt I had to remember. Even though Outliers is a stimulating, thought provoking work, you don't have to be a doctoral candidate in philosophy to understand what Gladwell is saying. He's not trying to show the reader how ""deep"" he can be, he just makes his points clearly & distinctly.",1
"Heard it was good, found it disjointed and didn't agree with many of his conclusions. Enjoyed the first few chapters but lost all interest half way through. Seemed fairly disjointed with not much organization. I disagree with some of his conclusions, and feel he has found cases that fit his theory, but thrown out others that do not.",0
World Changing... Re-reading Now. This book includes knowledge that could change the world if applied to real world cultural issues. This book reads as highly engaging and I couldn't put it down. It has now been added in my annual must read list. Wow!,1
interesting and thought provoking. This book offers a fascinating new perspective on success. Loved it. Gladwell's presentation of these ideas and his narration are wonderful.,1
"Amazingly insightful. Just a remarkable book. Well researched and written, Gladwell makes you feel as though you are finding the answers to these questions and learning together. Highly recommend.",1
Great insightful read. Lots of lessons on the thin margin between success and average. I took this as a guide for how to create the environment for success of those that come after me.,1
"Quality Gladwell. If you are familiar with Malcome Gladwell's pod cast, Revisionist History, this is the long form. Outliers is engaging, fascinating, compelling and deeply thought provoking. I will be listening to it again to catch the points I may have missed and clarify my own thoughts about the ideas and dense research presented.",1
Five Stars. Really good book. Has opened my eyes to different views.,1
"Great Stories, with a point. MG is a great story teller which makes you not want to put the book down - and the stories have a point - bonus! Great insights into success and failure. Wish he had explored the cultural ""background"" aspects more. This read also offers very practical parenting and coaching tips for bringing out the best in people, although they obviously aren't labelled as such.",1
Great. Fascinating really,1
"Outliers. This was a fascinating read. Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me. The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward. Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.",1
good. I have received the outliers by Malcom Gladwell in a short time with a good condition. Thank you. I enjoyed reading the book.,1
great. very nicely packaged. the book arrived in great condition and smelt really nice. 10/10 would buy again,1
Five Stars. Great book for knowledge,1
"Excellent Read. very thought provoking...makes you look at any situation or person in a different light. He gets a little long winded with some of his stories and examples. At times I found myself skipping ahead thinking ""ok, I get it already"". I find myself using the phrase ""outliers"" in general conversation...so it definately has a ""sticky"" factor. I recommend all of his books. I got these on audio for my weekly road trips. I especially like hearing them in the writers voice.",1
"Great, Amazing, Easy Read. Great, amazing, easy read. I often force myself to sit down and read but this book made me want to, I carried it everywhere just to squeeze in a few extra seconds of reading. I can honestly say this book has educated me more and given me unlikely perspectives. If you don't read this book it's your loss.",1
Five Stars. Very good book,1
A different side of how we view success. -----The Good Stuff-----,1
"Wholeheartedly Disagree. The whole premise of this book is to convince the reader that successful people such as Bill Gates and the Beatles were more products of fortunate situations and less of their own doing, which is total whiny socialist b.s., and anecdotal at best. What about the rest of us?",1
"Insightful and worth reading. Loved it! It tweaked my perspective on success. this book was engaging, insightful and entertaining. I recently started reading frequently and books like this would definitely make me keep reading.",1
Brilliant. One of the best books have have read (listened to),1
Outliers. I really enjoy reading this book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Gladwell gave many stories on life with people that became successful.,1
very good. It really makes me think...very good book,1
"Great book. Funny and interesting. To be read with caution, specially when it refers to patterns related with dates of birth. Some may believe that the fact of being born in 1955 or so would make you a billionary or a more likely to be millionaire.",1
Incredibly Compiled. This was such an informative book. At no point did I ever want to put this book down. I felt myself gaining knowledge from every page. A must read.,1
An easy read. Malcom gladwell is a great writer,1
"Well Worth Reading. Three blocks from our office in Boston is the spot where Benjamin Franklin was born and played as a child. Franklin is the American icon of the Self Made Man we so admire today. His story is that those with ability and willingness to work hard can change the world. Don't be defeated by humble origins, lack of money, or lack of education.",1
Malcolm the genius. loved it from the start to end. book is very thought provoking to say the least,1
"Could change the world, if we want it.. Gladwell's methodical takedown of the Western myth of individual exceptionalism and success as a singular achievement is nothing short of masterful.",1
"Opportunity make all of difference. Great book,",1
Highly recommend.. Excellent book.,1
"Great but.... Malcolm Gladwell's style is engaging no matter what but in this book he tends to twist some stories to fit into the flow of ideas, he tends to mix between correlation and causation and over-dramatizes some stories.",1
"Redundant. After reading few chapters it felt like I knew the whole book. All the chapters were long, dry, and unnecessarily redundant",1
Great listen!. Malcolm does a phenomenal job at breaking down the keys to success. Narration was meh...,1
A Must Read. This is a book that really makes you think---very interesting and you wish all your children had birthdays in January. Why?  Read the book.,1
"Touching performance. For all of those who felt they fell, just short get a lot of validation and fulfillment from my man Malcolm and his second to latest hit. If you haven’t read talking to strangers, go, read, listen actually.... now!",1
"Some Great Insights. I was a big fan of Galdwell`s first two books, the Tipping Point, and Blink.",1
"Highly recommended. Good book. Easy to read. Thought provoking. Makes one think about privilege and opportunity. Interesting cases and anecdotes. I'll never look at self-proclaimed ""self-made"" people the same way.",1
The Outliers - Success is deeper than you think. The outliers is mind-blowing and revealing. It shows a fascinating way to analyze human behavior. How can someone's birthday predict success? Why did life take you into a certain direction? These and other questions are answered with compelling facts and data. Situations that appear to be mere coincidences are actual blueprints to success.,1
Five Stars. Loved it!,1
Four Stars. It's a great book to read,1
"Insightful and interesting. What I enjoyed about this book is it's  straightforward and brings facts to the table, whilst explaining how the stories mentioned contributed to success.",1
Mind blowing!. So far this book is blowing my mind and I'm more than excited to finish it!,1
Worth it!!. Great read. Makes you think,1
"Excellent Read, Freshman-College level required reading. Have you ever wondered why some people make it and some people don't? Malcolm Gladwell exams this question through interviews with many persons",1
"Just mind-opening!. I have been hearing about Malcolm Gladwell for years and thinking he was bright and that I ought to read his books, but never found myself in the mood. I’m so glad I finally jumped in! They are not “difficult reads” and the way he explains things and provides concrete examples seems effortless and enjoyable. I can’t say enough positive things about this book and his others.",1
"Awesome Book. This is a must read book and should be added to anyone's Library. This order was for the CD virsion, it was great to be able to listen to it while I was driving to work (fairly long drive time). I like talk radio but this was benifical time spent. I ended up buy the book to read as well and to put on my shelf for future reference.",1
Five Stars. Really good book.,1
"Thought Provoking. You go through a flurry of thought, emotions, skepticism, doubt, disappointment, hope. and a greater understanding of how the world works.",1
"Opinion from a weak mind. I want to think that I gained something from the book, and I'm sure that I did, but I don't remember.",1
Great Book. Fascinating listen. Opens the mind to how most of the successful people in everyday life have been provided an advantage to succeed.,1
Five Stars. love the book,1
"Every one should read this book!. I have read this book twice so far and will refer to it often I am sure. Parents will find it very useful in motivating their students and students of all ages will find it a terrific explanation of ""why do I have to learn this"" Opportunity is everywhere if one can learn how to recognize it.",1
"Amazing, and informative. A well researched compilation of incredible stories of human achievement based on an assortment of circumstance. Both intriguing and enlightening. Damn good read!",1
GREAT READ FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT.. Great read understanding self and personal developing.,1
"Good read. Great book, it gives a good perspective on why and how the Bill Gates of the world got to where they were. The story telling makes it easy to understand and very reader friendly.",1
"Highly recommended. I'm a big M. Gladwell fan and I enjoy reading of his research. It's definitely a great read if you have kids or are considering. It's a book full of stories about successful people and failures as well to teach us to look outside the box when we judge people who are ""outliers"" in our society. Very interesting!",1
"Get it, listen to it, and then get his other books. I do not know what more I can say. He is a master word smith and he is knowledgable in his breadth and depth of outliers. I can say that I have never thoroughly enjoyed any other author as I have with Malcolm Gladwell. His nuanced words leap off the page, as only he can say them with the tone and inflections he writes with.",1
"Well, it's official: Malcolm Gladwell has run out of things to say.",0
"Mindblown and humbled. An absolutely mesmerizing storyline and performance. My whole perspective on all my achievements shifted. I feel so thankful to my parents, my grandparents, my friends, church, teachers who helped shape my life. I want my future children to read this book and understand the value of hard work, that it's not just about being naturally smart or talented.",1
Great book!!!. Great book. It’s a bit slow at beginning but worth the read. Will reinforce key behaviors.,1
Three Stars. Very insightful with regards to transparent social patterns that make people more susceptible in becoming outliers.,1
"Nice book. Corner slightly damaged when it came. Nice book. Corner slightly damaged when it came, but I could care less. After done with it for summer reading, probably gonna burn it anyway....",1
wonderful and thought provoking. one of my top 5 books would definitely recommend this reading for anyone. intellectual and informative,1
Good book. Very good I liked it And I don’t like to many things Worth Listening to,1
Outstanding. Top book. Great narrator. It is narrated by the author Malcolm Gladwell. You can tell in the tone of the voice and the emphasis the ideas he's trying to pull through.,1
Truly enlightening. Great read,1
"outliers by malcomn glad well. Book written in a totally different angle with deep insights , must read,for aspiring leaders, people seeking inspiration and technocrats",1
"Interesting, short, straightforward. 1) It's not a long book.",1
I found it very insightful and thought he would enjoy the. I actually bought this book for my son. I had already read it. I found it very insightful and thought he would enjoy the read,1
"How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, Practice, Practice. Gladwell proves that the old joke is true. In point of fact you have to practice for 10,000 hours. This is a trippy little book that amused me with its many ""aha"" moments. Many of the detractors have given this book a low rating due to the fact that some of the findings are not new. For the semi-illiterate such as me - that's OK. I haven't read the other books referred to so I found Outliers FASCINATING! I knew that the kids of my Asian friends were better at math than my kids - I just never knew why. I thought Bill Gates was just lucky as well as smart. I didn't know he'd paid his dues, and paid and paid and paid. I'd heard about all the rich old guys of the 1800's but didn't see any commonality until Gladwell pointed out their birth years. Maybe Outliners is not the most innovative, or the first, or the most literary look at the story of success but it's still a darn good read.....bg",1
"Gladwell delivers yet another thought provoking read. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell argues that there is no secret to success. There are key ingredients, he says, such as being in the right place at the right time, receiving extra tutoring/training, and additional opportunities. Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc? In summary, there are no short cuts to success and very few successful people who have not put in their 10,000 hours of practice. Now, stop reading this review and get practicing!",1
Awesome. Great book. Seriously. Everyone should have to read this.,1
Excellent book. This is one of the life-changing books.,1
"My eyes were closed and now they are opened. The entire premise of Outliers is that the successful among us are NOT the product of luck, but rather the hard efforts of work. Sure, certain among us were the result of circumstances beyond their control, but the underlying message is that if you work hard, you can be a success. A wonderful book that should be read by all and studied so that as a society we break down our preconceived notions that some are lucky and others are not.",1
"Good book. Good condition, had some highlighting over it but that’s to be expected",1
"I like it, and I'd recommend it. The book started strong, but then faded as it went on. I like it, and I'd recommend it, but the last half didn't do for me what the first half did.",1
Loved it!. Life changer! Loved it!,1
"discouraging. well written but deeply discouraging. take-home message of this book is is, if you switch careers too many times, you'll never be particularly successful.",0
"quick read but how much did you really learn from it?. Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.",1
... deeper framework and perspective on life's successes and some good and valuable insights. Provided a deeper framework and perspective on life's successes and some good and valuable insights. The way you think is important Outliers is an important catalyst in this regard.,1
What a thought provoking book. I will no longer look at someone’s story to success as “on the face of it” this book helped me understand that there are so many variables that contribute to success.,1
"Worthwhile Read!. Malcolm Gladwell is such a phenomenal thinker and writer! I bought this book, along with Start with Why, for my 16 year old nephew who is pondering his place in the world. These two books, along with Malcolm Gladwell's other work has personally helped me gain a better understanding of myself and others, and has helped me change how I live my life. Buy the book!",1
"Really mazing!. I really enjoyed this book. It was such a great read and very informative. It caused me to have a better understanding and see success in a different light. I actually recommended this book to all my friends because it was such a great read with good information and really sparked great conversations. I will recommend this book, and this author 100 times over!",1
"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic. Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",1
Fascinating. Great book,1
Life changing. Changes your perspective and thinking,1
"Thought Provoking. Insightful observations of happenstance, timing, and opportunity. A tour of success with Malcolm Gladwell as the tour guide. Must read!",1
Captivating Story’s. Must read or listen to! I really liked the individual stories and always looked forward to listening more. I enjoyed the book as it really made me think and relate to today’s life and business.,1
empowering and insightful. Fascinating book full of stuff to quote and refer too.,1
"It is a well told story of success which also explains why and how if the success story. It is a good r. Ado g for anyone who wants to analyze success or failure, which are two races of the same coin. The only difference I have with his analyses is that fate is though routed in the past can be modified.

"Five Stars. Love this author. Yet again, success with Outliers.",1
"great. I loved it. His voice is easy to listen to as well, which I look for in an audio book.",1
Great Business Read and Helpful with Life Skills. Great book. I borrowed it from my daughter who has it on her Freshman (High School) reading list. I thought that was a bit odd but business sense starts somewhere.,1
Another way of seeing.. My 16 year old grandson was asked to read this over the summer. I read it in order to talk with him about it. I thought the first 1/2 was the most applicable for a teenager and I enjoyed that part the best. I look forward to some discussion once he has also read it. I am an MSW and always am intrigued by this type of book that takes a new way of seeing human accomplishment.,1
Good read would recommend. I bought this book as a group reading for a company that I worked out. It was a good read.,1
Fantastic. I loved his theories(whether you chose to agree or not) and I very much enjoyed to listen to him read his own book. I’m excited to get into his other books.,1
"Fascinating. From sports champions to plane crashes, he ties everything together in such a compelling way.",1
Needs To Be On Every Student's Required Reading List. I don't care who you are; read this book.,1
"My favorite Gladwell book so far. My favorite Gladwell book so far. I think I have read at least four of his books. Certain chapters really captivated me. Some of those were about birthdates, timing and certain things that had to be lined up for certain people to succeed, the 10,000-hour concept, and the plane crash chapter.",1
How Success Happened... Great Book. An interesting look at success and how it happened.,1
"Does as advertised: explains outliers. You may have heard that this book explains outliers in society well, and this delivers.",1
"Fascinating.. Gladwell's books are absolutely fascinating. The topics he explores often seem completely mundane, however, the angle he takes on all of these subjects are completely unusual. The end result is a greater understanding of the subject matter and more importantly, a greater understanding of the processes being described in the books.",1
"Brilliant -Thinking out of the box. This is Gladwell's best book. Wiped out my flawed assumptions on various aspects of success. His obsevation that the upper classes of society teach their kids to be assertive was an ""ah ha"" moment for me.",1
"Inspiring.. Such original thinking, so many interesting new ideas. An inspiring work, one that really altered my view of accomplishment. And while I rarely think the author is the best reader, Gladwell is super. Don't miss the interview at the end.",1
Five Stars. Great book.,1
Five Stars. So good bought it twice,1
Best in the market!. Awesome,1
I AM IN LOVE with this book. I absolutely love this book. It makes so much sense. Common sense things that I know but it is explained so beautifully/ perfectly in this book. This is one of the greatest books of my life and I love reading it. Thank you Malcolm Gladwell for writing it.,1
"Very encouraging read. I found this a very encouraging book. First of all it confirms what I tell people all the time about my career - I just work harder than everyone else which is why I tend to do very well. It also explains why others do even better, they had the opportunity of both circumstance and culture. Especially the accounts of Chris Langan and Oppenheimer...I find that my background and culture have delt me some of the same attitudes as Langman, but that it is possible to recognize this and unlearn these traits. Sadly, I see that I have already passed down some of these things to my children!",1
"Fascinating. Thought provoking and fascinating. A different look, a different approach to analyzing success. Thoroughly enjoyed it and want to read more of his books.",1
"Awesome. Really enjoyed this book. will listen again. The narrator was easy to listen to, thanks.",1
"Entertaining and credible read. Concept that hard work, upbringing, experiences and circumstances shape who becomes an outlier vs not is fascinating. Great examples to back it up, in the usual entertaining style of Gladwell.",1
"Great book. Funny and interesting. To be read with caution, specially when it refers to patterns related with dates of birth. Some may believe that the fact of being born in 1955 or so would make you a billionary or a more likely to be millionaire.",1
"Outlier is a Standout in and of Itself. Throw out any other self-help book and substitute it with this. As meticulous and fact-based Gladwell’s work is, it is all too inspiring to learn what the true formula for success is. Well-written and pleasantly read, this was a great book to listen to all the way to the very end.",1
"Fascinating reading.. I found this book most interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think ""outside"" the box - no pun intended.",1
"Engaging. This, Gladwell's third book, was the first I experienced... my response, I immediately bought the first two (The Tipping Point and Blink) and will buy his latest very soon. This is well written, easy to understand, interesting, engaging, and useful. I loved it and find myself telling people about it alot.",1
"Worth a read.. The book had its points, I could really get you thinking. It was over bearing when the same idea was covered too much. It could inspire and make you think.",1
Loved it!. Gladwell makes some keen observations based on critical research and has a great reading voice. I really enjoyed this book & highly recommend it.,1
"Thoughts on Gladwell's Outliers: An exceptional book on exceptions. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is an exceptional book about exceptions. The book goes through many different case stories talking about many different types of exceptions -- ie exceptional individuals such as Bill Gates and other early computer pioneers, exceptional events such as plane crashes, exceptional communities such as the town in Pennsylvania with great longevity, and even exceptional populations such as Asians and their achievement in math. It discusses all of these exceptions as not products of innate biological difference between people but as contingent facts to do with how individuals dealt with the opportunities presented to them and how culture shaped this dealing with the opportunity.",1
Outliers. Unique and interesting,1
Very good book. Good book,1
"Recommended. This is a great book, it is really interesting and offers an insight into the circumstances that help people in becoming successful. You can tell a lot of research has gone into this book - it's full of stories that you want to retell! The book arrived on time and there were no issues with the seller, would buy from them again.",1
"Great Resource.. Very helpful , insightful and resourceful. It ensures a heart of gratitude for the many coincidences and orchestrations that create my world of current opportunities.",1
Five Stars. great read,1
"Must read for those who want to know what makes some people successful and others not so much.. I found it to be a very enlightening read as it was reinforced that success is earned, not given. Circumstances do play a part but not entirely. I recommend this book to everyone.",1
Five Stars. Food for thought,1
required reading. High school students and educators! Should be read the moment a woman knows she is having a baby! Everyone in society. Career class use it as curriculum!!!!! Life changing. Sad I didn't read this 30 years ago!!!!,1
Excellent book with thought provoking presentations that will last a lifetime.. Excellent and thought provoking review. A must read for everybody.,1
"Wonderfully interesting book - ok so you only see it .... Wonderfully interesting book - ok so you only see it from the authors view - no critical analysis in this book, but some interesting points nevertheless",1
"You should read this book. I love this book and how the author relates so many stories to make it very understandable. Get it, read it, know it!",1
"Best of His Work so Far. This was easily the best of Gladwell's work so far. It really gets at the concepts of what helps people succeed. And, to a large extent, success is not something one is born with. A person shapes their future and their success through a mix of talent and lots of hard work. As an educator, I quote this book heavily with both staff and students.",1
Interesting!. I found this quite interesting -- it certainly makes one review where their start in life has led them.,1
Great book. Bought the book for my daughter for college and then my husband read it. They both really enjoyed reading it.,1
Five Stars. great book,1
nice read. Well crafted and an easy to understand way of explaining the success of outliers. A good light read for everyone,1
Five Stars. Great read!,1
Five Stars. great book,1
"Gets you thinking!. Just finished #Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell! It was great! I do want to mention why.. I was really intrigued by the multiple analogies and parables used in so many famous and ordinary people's lives. Ranging from Bill Gates and Bill Joy to geniuses like Einstein and autodidacts like Chris Langs. To pilots to rice Farmers to Jamaicans to the people in The Deep South and finally people like me who are just very lucky. I loved how he was able to encompass all of our strengths and weaknesses to help us realize how the outliers are created in our world and how we can become or already are, our own outlier! Definitely a book that makes you go...huh 🤔❤️",1
Master piece of Information analysis. Malcolm Gladwell has done an excellent job in conveying the secrets of success using parables from the real world. I especially liked the story of Airplane crashes and the deep seated study of the human factors involved in the accidents.,1
Great book with great illustrations of their premises. Great book with great illustrations of their premises. Wish it could have had a little more emphasis on qualities of character that allowed people to take advantage of the right timing and social circumstances.,1
"Re-read Even Better Than the First Read. Parts of Outliers hit home for me. I am a retired psychologist who worked with children with special needs. I was born in November in the early post World War II years. Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce. I struggled until I became an adolescent. With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out. It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation. Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools. My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.",1
"Which was perfect, because I was 2 days late to ordering .... The 1 book I had to read in college that wasn't a drag.",1
"LADY LUCK in YOUR LIFE!. Absolutely fascinating ... goes to prove that LUCK, from birth date, year, environment (family and economy and climate) and technology (all or some of the above) play a huge role in how successful a person becomes!",1
"What storytelling!. Gladwell’s prowess at building beautiful stories and deriving meaning out of them is unparalleled. The diversity of examples he uses to draw his central theme is incredibly vast, and offers the readers a lot of insights into several cultures and times in history. A very easy read, that lends a lot of perspective still.",1
A profound paradigm shift.. Gladwell sure knows how to turn beliefs and conventional wisdom on their ears. Deeply thought through and well researched.,1
"I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. The author argues that success is shaped by the environment we grow up in as much as any innate skills and knowledge we have. While I buy into his argument, his approach of substantiating his position with a few select examples is rather weak. I could easily find counter examples for each one he presents. When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling. The book is an easy and enjoyable read, although towards the last third of the book, it seems like he ran out of things to say and digresses away from the main point of the book.",0
An Excellent book!. This book completely blew my mind and changed my thinking about what constitutes success. It's given me a fresh perspective on my own life and some gold nuggets of truth for the future. I highly recommend this book to anyone out there who's searching for some answers about what it means to be successful and how to go about achieving it.,1
"Garbage. I wish I had saved my money.. A predetermined, narrow, oversimplified conclusion is reached by the author. All success is simply due to someone getting a lucky break. He concludes there is nothing extraordinary about it. They just had lucky breaks by enjoying the right opportunities.",0
First Gladwell book but not my last.. Two weeks after receiving this book I'm now on my third Malcolm Gladwell book. Amazing author who writes in a style to draw the reader into every story.,1
Very intresting book!. Loved the book! although I disagreed with some parts I thought it was an eye opening book.,1
fantastic!. great read! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to more from this author,1
"Fascinating, A MUST READ!!!!. I've read all three of Malcolm Gladwell's novels. His work is always exciting! This one doesn't disappoint. I am enjoying every minute and definitely recommend to everyone and anyone. My husband and I are reading this one together. As parents of 2 young children, this book has inspired us to have a different thinking approach to the learning process. It reminds us of the importance of even seemingly small tasks. For instance, reading books every night and having the kids ""read the book"" back to us is a great experience for them. Even though they can't read yet, they are participating in the process. I totally agree with his premise regarding education. We should all get actively involved in our children's lives by providing opportunities to learn. With the proper guidance, we can teach them to participate and think independently, instead of taking a back seat in life. I don't care whether my kids are the next Bill Gates or big shot lawyer making a zillion dollars a year. I want them to be happy and have every opportunity to be successful and hopefully, in their own small way, make a difference on this planet.",1
"good book. very interesting read/listen. the author delivers their point across clearly, would recommend it to anyone wanting some insights in what makes great people great...",1
Five Stars. Excellently written,1
quality. Good stuff,1
"THE OUTLIERS. The book on cd is very interesting non fiction. I wish I had read it when I was raising children. I am not convinced that the conclusions the author makes are all that objective and scientific, but still they sound plausible.I am only half way through the book at this time.",1
"very informative work, I look forward. to other works by this author. I support anyone thinking about reading this book. fifteen words.",1
"Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy. I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",1
"An interesting look at what creates success. In this wide-ranging third installment of Malcolm Gladwell's exploration of how people and social phenomena work, the New Yorker journalist takes a close look at what constitutes high levels of success. That is, what makes people at the top of their respective fields get there? As we've come to expect from Gladwell's previous books, the answer to the question is a bit complicated.<br /><br />He says that upbringing, culture and even random luck have something to with success, but there is another important quality that anyone can control. Two chapters are dedicated to the ""revelation"" that IQ is only a baseline quality and success has little to nothing to do with having a high IQ or a low IQ. Rather, success is substantially a product of cultivating a high degree of what Robert Sternberg calls ""practical intelligence"" or what most refer to as ""emotional intelligence.""<br /><br />Gladwell uses the example of Nobel laureates coming from unknown schools as often as ivy league schools. At this level of mastery IQ is no longer a factor. Success has little to do with where you were educated and everything to do with your level of practical/emotional intelligence and willingness to put in the 10,000 hours of practice required to reach mastery of your field.<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting read that isn't too heady and goes by pretty quickly, as the interesting anecdotes are what you would expect from Gladwell.<br /><br />Another book on the topic that I strongly recommend because it has been really helpful to me in actually applying what Gladwell teaches in my own life (for my own success!) is The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book.",1
Enjoyable read but not very believable.. Enjoyable read but not very believable. Good for the wishful thinker.,1
"Five Stars. GREAT PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY. AAA+++",1
"Gladwell's perspective. love the Gladwell books, have them all...this one is as fascinating as the rest!",1
"Amazing Book!. Want to succeed in whatever your skill set is - read, then reread this book.  Then get to work... put in your 10,000+ hours doing what you do best and make it happen! Success!",1
Five Stars. Very satisfied.,1
"Not my favorite. I kept waiting for the meaning of the book until the last page. The facts were interesting, but I got very little from this book except that success takes time and commitment.",0
"Understanding what makes success helps in creating it; must read.. Very well written, easy to read and follow analyses of factors that contribute to success (or failure when missed), applied to examples in sports, business (computer industry, lawyers), education and aviation. Divided up into two parts; whereas the second part tries to focus on cultural legacy in general as a giant 'sleeper' (unknown) factor, the first part describes and zooms in on seemingly random examples in order to introduce us to the factors that are not generally known or associated with the successes high-lighted/discussed.",1
Five Stars. Some expected but some really startling observations in this book. Well written to hold your attention.,1
"Fascinating. I don't normally read non fiction so when I got assigned this book for class I thought I was in for a boring read, but it's actually very fascinating and good! I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys non fiction, science, and psychology.",1
"Keen observations, well presented. I found this book highly interesting and entertaining. It reads very well and is a true page turner.",1
Five Stars. Loved it!,1
"Bas van de Haterd. Absolutely brilliant. Gladwell, in his own way, describes that succes doesn't come to anyone just like that. He takes very far fetched examples and makes it clear cut that it all seems to be connected. And it is. The implications on what he writes however go further then what he defines. If you open your mind to it, it seems there is so much we never thought about out there.",1
"Book Review. This book came very fast and is exactly like the picture, it’s a really good book and looks beyond the idealistics of the world.",1
"McSuccess. This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists. However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful. I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations. After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A. Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause. Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era. Duhhhh. What makes his ""research"" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation. For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable. In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion? Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.",0
"Eye opener. Great read, fast read, mind blown!!",1
Excellent. Everything is perfect!,1
Five Stars. Great read!,1
"waste of time. At 3.99, I thought I was getting a deal. Not the first time the ny times list has failed me..... I wish I could get my money back. This book states the obvious, which is harmless. But then the author extrapolates into the realm of ridiculousness. Save your time and your 3.99.....",0
Why did I not read this earlier?. This was a very helpful book for me as an educator. I love Malcom’s perspective and insight.,1
"Eye Opening Insights into Factors Guiding Success. This book is a true page-turner. Many of the chapters tell interesting stories that explain why certain people or groups of people are successful at what they do. However, there are some very practical sections too. Scientific evidence showing that success cannot be achieved without extensive practice and that children should be taught to speak intelligently to authority figures are two of the best examples of why this book is a resource for practical applications.",1
Fair. fantastic book ..,1
"Nature vs Nurture. The debate of Nature versus Nurture is an old one. Hero culture, that idea of individual exceptionalism willed from “boot strap” beginnings, prevails heavily in the US. What this vision lacks is the detailed history and nuanced perspective on all of the circumstances that set up success in spite of all other factors.",1
Gladwell is genius!. A new way of looking at information that provides insight to successful individuals. It is a great guide for parents to read as they raise their children. Sometimes small changes make a huge difference.,1
Five Stars. Gladwell - always very good.,1
It wasn't really what I was expecting. This book .... It wasn't really what I was expecting. This book was more of a study on Anthropology than a self-help book.,1
Five Stars. Great product worth for money and arrived as promised.,1
STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND BUY THIS BOOK!. PHENOMENAL BOOK!!! Where has this book been? Truly a life changing book! Great read!,1
Excellent gift for an 11th grader. A gift,1
"Great book, terrible condition.. This book is awesome, definitely recommend. I already own a copy but bought this one used. It was advertised as used but in good condition. This book is creased, dirty, and just overall in bad shape. Not as advertised, and quite a disappointment.",1
Four Stars. This book was very interesting. The ideas discussed were very eye-opening.,1
"Wonderful read, really opened my eyes!. I thought this book was wonderful. I purchased it after seeing a special on this author on 60 minutes ( or one of those types of shows). Well worth the time if you have children",1
"Letter to Author. Dear Mr. Gladwell,  am a high school student and in my English class we are studying and analyzing the essential question, ""To what extent do time and place define a person?"" The purpose of this question is to understand what it takes to be successful in the ""real"" world. Your book could not answer this question better than it already does. Time and place can drastically impact a person's successfulness as portrayed in this book. Three particular chapters that exemplify this are The Matthew Effect, The 10,000 Hour Rule, and Harlan, Kentucky.  found the Matthew Effect to be very interesting. The connections shown in this chapter completely shocked me and I made me realize just how true they are. It tells of a Canadian all-star hockey team. The players on the team had a natural advantage over kids their age though, because of the cut off dates. With how they fell, the bigger and older boys naturally had more ability, therefore giving them an unfair advantage over the other boys in their birth year. This chapter gives an example of how time and place gave the hockey players greater opportunities than some of the other ones. I definitely agree with this chapter completely, even though I never even realized it was happening. The question that this chapter left me with was if the same situation happens with school and grades today. he next chapter, The 10,000 Rule, was the one that I found to be the most interesting and informative. The idea is that a person cannot perfect a skill until they have had 10,000 hours of practice put into it. I agree with this rule. It seems like an extreme number, but if you think about it; it really does make sense why it would be so high. And how can someone not be perfect at a skill after 10,000 hours? Time needs to be sacrificed and given in order to achieve what the person wants to achieve. he last chapter, Harlan, Kentucky was intriguing. It made me see culture in a different aspect. The idea that place could have that much affect on a person's personality and perspective about everything is interesting. I agree with the idea of the chapter, though, again, I never gave it much consideration before reading this book. It makes me wonder how this idea could have affected my family and point of view.  lot of the stories in the book relate to me in some way or another and that is what makes it such a great read. I found connections in all of the chapters that I mentioned and I believe that they all hold much truth. hanks for your time! anielle",1
"Great!!. I love this book! I think that if you like to read about not just a wow story....but, what might be behind the wow....the 'quick' rises to fame and money etc....this book is for you. It proves that anyone can be an 'outlier'....I think it is a well thought out book and a quick read! I highly recommend!",1
"Fascinating!. This book delivers exactly as promised on the cover. I finally now have a better understanding as to why it seems Asians are better at Math! This book gives a deeper understanding to what the late Randy Pausch said by ""winning the parent lottery"" and how it helped shape him into a successful adult. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to understand the whys in life.",1
Five Stars. Good.,1
"Four Stars. Good read, interesting stats, conclusions may not be fully accurate, variety of outliers helps reader see similarities.",1
"Ok Book For Those In The Know, Great Book For Those Unaware. Gladwell's insights are helpful in some ways in describing a very small percentage of the popular outlier stories. But I think it places a little bit too much emphasis on luck and opportunity rather than on gift, intellect, and pure skill. For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things. However, I think if you put someone else in Bill Gates shoes, events would not be guaranteed to turn out the same just because that `someone else' was in place of Bill Gates luck and opportunity.",1
Interesting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Have been a fan of Gladwell since reading Tipping Point. Interesting the points that he makes regarding the impact of historical events on the individuals within the book.,1
buy it. Great book of you own a home or not. It puts everything in perspective. Good history,1
Outliers. Interesting facts to keep in mind for having more opportunities in life. Specially that we can improve with our efforts,1
Perfect product!. Read this book before you die.,1
"Fabulous important book for me. He is a fabulous storyteller and brought forth a really complete picture of a truly unique topic. This is centered around the necessary requirements to being extremely successful, specifically the correlations within this group.",1
Overall I enjoyed reading Outliers and I would definitely recommend it to .... Have you ever wondered why some people prevail and live remarkably successful lives while others fail to reach their full potential?,1
Great book. Truly informative and informational. Great book. Truly informative and informational. You won't believe how good this book is until you actually read it. I got the Kindle edition. Outstanding!,1
"Outliers book review. I would recommend this book for book club discussions. Ours was very interesting. Stick with it past the hockey, unless this is your interest area. The last half was applicable to our retired teacher group.",1
guide for history of success. a great study on the how and why of success. Should be a must read for high school students,1
Great book on things you know but don’t realize. A must read to see what’s behind it all ..great perspective on what and where someone comes from,1
"Fascinating and thought-provoking.. While reading this book, I have recounted different parts of it to at least ten people. It just makes my mind whirl. Also it is just a fun read, very clear conversational in style.",1
Great book!. Great book. Would recommend.,1
