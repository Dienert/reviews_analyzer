"Good book! I even bought a copy for my .... Good book! I even bought a copy for my son to read. He's in college. The part Mr. Gladwell doesn't really discuss is the spiritual component of the stories he brings up in the book though. At the beginning he mentions this Italian town that moved to America and their great success. He mentions their faith as a key component to their success in this introduction story, but never brings it up again. Without this developed piece the book feels like it is missing something. But, even so, it is a great book. Very thought provoking!",1
GREAT BOOK MUST READ. This book is an amazing read I don't read much but this is an amazing book that give you a new perspective on how the people we see as successful got to where they are and the trues reasoniNguyen behind it worth the buy amazing book highly recommended,1
"Fantastic read. I bought this book on a whim based on the conversation Malcom had with [...] writer Bill Simmons. I am extremely happy I got it. The book was thought provoking and Malcom has such a great way of communicating his thoughts on his paper. Even though this is the summer, when most people want to read for enjoyment and not want to think too much, buy this book... you'll be thoroughly enjoyed.",1
Exceeding my expectations.. Topic is fascinating. I've known about the book from my brother going back around 16 yrs ago.,1
I consider this a must read. Gladwell's best effort so far. Essential reading for young people to obtain a more realistic understanding of the value of hard work and practice. You have to put in the effort to get to the top.,1
"Some Great Insights. I was a big fan of Galdwell`s first two books, the Tipping Point, and Blink.",1
Excellent read.. Great book! This book had some very great points and it was an enjoyable read.,1
"My 16 year old loves it!. My daughter needed this book for her AP English language class in school. However, she has read it several times, and told me how much she enjoys the book. Win/win!",1
"Sensational. it tells nothing happens by chance, esp. outstanding outliers, which is combination of all the different sources.",1
Very good book that came in excellent condition. Exceeded my expectations ... Very good book that came in excellent condition,1
This is such a great book. I had to read it for a .... This is such a great book. I had to read it for a class but I enjoyed it tremendously. Gladwell has a very out of the box unique perspective on things. When you read is correlations to cause your just like wow. He leaves you floored. I've heard of his other works and I'm told they have a very similar approach.,1
"NOT all it's cracked up to be. I'd give this a single star, but the creativity of the subject is enough to warrant at least two stars. Plus everyone seems to discount one-stars as vendetta reviews.",0
Five Stars. Love this mans books. Super engaging and so interesting. I couldnt put them down.,1
Excellent Read. This is such a good read. Malcolm Gladwell is an exceptional author of high intelligence who has grown accustom to writing for the masses. He can make the most complex topic easy to understand for anyone who is able to read at an 8th grade level. Great book with excellent arguments.,1
"Very Thought Provoking. Excellent book. This book has been assigned to incoming freshmen at my school who are enrolled in the AVID program. I am going to be teaching an AVID elective course and wanted to read before school started in the fall. I am so glad I did, it is very interesting to see how we can change and become outliers as well.",1
"Gladwell always delivers a unique take. I’ve listened to or read most of his books and they all strike at something that ripples under the surface of reality and guides humanity as a whole or individually. He narrates his own book extremely well. I’ve heard him on a lot of podcasts and he is great speaking in general, but also reads very well.",1
"Five Stars. Great perspective on success. No fables, no myths.",1
Four Stars. It is quite an interesting read.,1
Four Stars. Revealing and thought provoking look at yet another set of patterns that Gladwell has uncovered.,1
Appreciate how far people grow and what got people to the top.. This book explained so much about why some people succeed and those that you thought should...didn't. The examples are fantastic and can be easily related to what one sees in their own life history.,1
"free state books US is a good distributor. free state books US is a good distributor: got my copy w very little markings, only signs of age, air exposure to the pages i bet. it had been in a library.",1
Best in the market!. our unit ceo recomanded this me to read i can its great book of learnings with story,1
"Kept me interested from start to finish.. Interesting book, but in spite of the research it is hard to believe.",1
"interesting. very interesting concept, i liked this book a lot",1
"A solid book, great stories and was enjoyable to read the whole time.. I wasn't blown away by this book from a 'enlightening' point of view, but it was a very enjoyable book. I loved the stories of other people, their experiences in life, and how it helped to frame their success and future. I was encouraged by this book to continue working hard at my skills and future, because I also truly believe its the countless hours of practice and struggle that makes someone an outlier, including of course the environment they are in.",1
"What's the big deal?. This is the second Malcolm Gladwell book I have listened to. I'm glad that I looked at some of the other reviews before I finished, rated and reviewed Outliers. I listened to Talking to Strangers first, and my initial impression was, What was that about? One gets a general notion of what Gladwell is trying to say in both books. However,if it were not for the title of the books, there would probably be a lot of head scratching in Gladwell's audience.",1
great book. I'm not a big reader but this was a great book.,1
"Inspiring and interesting. I have been quoting this book to friends on several occasions since finishing it. Or rather, since beginning to listen to it! I think that says a lot. It inspired me in the same kind of way as Freakonomics did when I read it a number of years ago. There is more reasoning in Outliers and it is more down to earth but there are similarities in how theories and models are applied to the things we all can relate to.",1
"Practical knowledge, easy to read, good presentation.. Easy read, excellent presentation.",1
Five Stars. Summer reading,1
Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read!. Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read! Love his concepts and research.,1
"IQ does not define success. Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different ""famously rich figures"" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.",1
"Full of useless facts.. I was really looking forward to read a Malcom Gladwell book. But this book is just a waste of time. It’s full of interesting facts, but he never brings them home.",0
"Starts Strong. The books starts great very intersting, but as you go through the book you start missing interest. It could have been a great book if it where shorter",1
"Another great Gladwell book.. Strongly recommended. Easy read but inspiring. As usual, Gladwell opens your eyes to illustrate what you've always looked at but never really saw",1
✍️,1
"I highly recommend the book to everyone. Malcolm answered a question that I always wondered about on how other people seemed lucky and appeared to have everything working for them. He had an ingenious way to tell his family story throughout this book, which made me more appreciative of reading the OUTLIERS and getting to know who is Malcolm.",1
Five Stars. Awesome book. Opens your mind to see the world as opportunity.,1
Terrific insight!. Terrific insight!,1
Read this book and you will want to share it with friends.. This is an awesome book full of some incredible information. It changed the way I look at things.,1
Slightly disappointed. the quality of book is not so good and also old one. I always received good quality books from flipkart bt this book not upto the standard.,0
"A book that ALL Americans need to read or listen!. My parents and all Americans need to read or listen to this book in this age especially. The old mantra of being self made hard work isn't the end all be all of success. Everyone successful has had help, luck and opportunity. Without blessings; you can work as hard as fully want; and get nothing for it. This is a sociological study of extremely successful people, and people with all the potential; but not enough of the opportunities. Everyone at the top of the world had a caveat. We would do better as society if we just accepted that fact.",1
"Fun read. I enjoyed this read. It's reasonably light, not packed with important academic studies or applications. But the stories are fun and point toward valuable insights that you will find applicable to everyday life.",1
Great book!!. This is such an interesting book. Malcolm Gladwell is very well versed in the subject and presents it in an easy to read manner.,1
Pretty Good. I wish there were more woman who were examples of success. It would've been more inspiring.,1
EYE OPENER. Malcolm did a terrific job coming up with such a masterpiece that proves that anybody can single themselves out of the arena of obscurity to a platform of greatness with practical steps. Worth reading,1
Great book. Very easy and mostly entertaining book.,1
"Author makes the point through meaningful stories.. At the beginning, I thought that he would describe the successful stories as an increased rate of change in effort distribution. However, he states how knowledge or creativity are not the only possible factors to raise opportunity but the individual's context.",1
"An informative, entertaining, yet droning novel. From the moment I began reading, I knew what I was in for. A book that spells out it's message in the title, while containing descriptive elaboration. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, in fact, there are a handful of sections that are truly fascinating. It just doesn't know where to go sometimes.",1
"This book is a very important look at how our great innovators rise to success.. I was struck by the clear research and scope of the work done on this book. Finally, someone has come to the truth of the luck of birth at a certain time, and luck of opportunity combined with concentration by the innovator, in seizing thr oppotunity or window of time.",1
Fascinating. Outliers was a fantastic book that took me by surprise with each turn of the page. I never knew how many outliers there could be and the subject matter fascinated me with every word. Hard to put down at times and went through the book rather quickly.,1
Uspa jr.. Thy moon goddess rules over all of thy land so sunk on thys new information,0
Five Stars. Amazing stories; one of my favorite authors!,1
Very eye opening. Very good,1
Outliers Review - Tolson. have not finished the book yet but i hear it is one of the greatest books ever written!,1
A decent read. pretty interesting study of why some things or people are outliers and his you have to look beyond the obvious.,1
"Gives you something to think about. Outliers was full of interesting examples. Our lives are intertwined with opportunity from positive, negative and neutral experiences. We don't often realize the lucky breaks in the moment. Great author.",1
Five Stars. Another great book,1
"Five Stars. Great book. Very informative, interesting, and thought provoking. Quick, easy read, and very entertaining.",1
"Great stuff, some great information in here. Loved this thought provoking book. I will never look at genius the same way again",1
Five Stars. very good,1
Good read.. Great book!,1
"Outside the Box. This author challenges =conventional= wisdom and supports his premises with facts, figures and real life peoples' stories. If the =powers that be= running the educational system in America read this book and applied subsequent principles, ours would be a very different country.",1
Very interesting. I really enjoyed this book! It gave an interesting perspective on success and I enjoyed reading it. I am looking forward to more from this author.,1
I got it for a college class and I swear it is such a good read!. Everyone must read this book! I got it for a college class and I swear it is such a good read!,1
Phenomenal. Well researched and greatly interesting. Fairly obscure topics examined by a passionate writer. Can't wait to read his other books!,1
Outliers. This is my second Malcom Gladwell book this month. 1st Tipping Point and now Outliers. I enjoyed both but this one was captivating from the start because it is very relatable to my life experiences.,1
It wakes me up.. This book gives me a chance to expand my viewpoint and translate the facts from various kinds of perspectives eventually enables me to get a bird eye over things.,1
my review. I haven't finished yet but this piece of shit wouldn't let me read with out review boom boom boom boom,1
"Salient and grounded. ​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",1
"Another terrific book from Gladwell. ""Outliers"", like other Gladwell books, is very enjoyable. It offers some interesting perspectives about what makes some people more successful than others, with particular emphasis on those who far exceed expectations. Many of the book's criticisms focus on what the book is not. I think that is a mistake. This is simply a fine book, a very thoughtful and easy read. The book goes into how one's ethnic roots and specific opportunities set the stage for dramatic success, then working hard takes over. For example:",1
First time. This is my first Gladwell book. It was OK. My friend recommended this book to me. The idea is intriguing but the style of writing did not resonate with me. Interesting observations.,1
"Adopt the nuggets of wisdom in this book and no .... Adopt the nuggets of wisdom in this book and no one would need affirmative action and myriad programs to uplift the ""poor"". Conservatives would be declawed and liberals defanged!",1
Five Stars. Excellent product and service,1
"The Chicken or the Egg. Life is unfair. Yes, different opportunities face all of us. However, and this is what the book seems to ignore, it is up to the individual to recognize and act. So, I don't believe it is the opportunity that make an outlier, it is the recognition of the opportunities, vision, desire, determination and action that produced the likes of Bill Gates. Keep in mind Bill Gates went to middle school with 300 other kids who all had the same access to the computer. So didn't all 300 have the same opportunity?",0
"Makes you think. I love any book that makes me think about things in new ways. I was hesitant at first to get this for the price of it, as I have been reading the free classics for a while, but I have heard much about it and been wanting to read it for a while, so I just treated myself. I enjoyed it and it gave you lots of great examples about how people become great many times due to things that put them in places at the right time. Treat yourself to the book if you have been wanting to read it for a while.",1
More fascinating facts from m More fascinating facts frm Malcolm. As interesting as Freakonomics but with more recognizable characters,1
"I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.",1
Five Stars. WELL ROUNDED AND INSIGHTFUL.,1
Great read! Highly recommend.. I really like the way Malcom Gladwell put things into perspective when it comes to the many ways our generational and cultural upbringing can influence our success. I appreciate the way the book ended on a more personal note which is made me come to understand and respect him that much more. Highly recommend this book.,1
"Very Humbling. Great book! It breaks down a lot of misconceptions about success and systematically explains how a person's success is hardly their own doing, rather an amalgam of culture, hard work, and good old-fashioned luck.",1
"Nice read.. The book is very much ""visualized storytelling"". The author has tried to elucidate various happenings of the past in the form of personalized stories which convey a message and at the same time compels the reader to see how it all boils down to simple formulas. Must read.",1
"Excellent read. Thought this was going to teach me about success, instead it was an eye opener to something even better. Practical steps are not always required for a book to be great, the only we need sometimes is a change in mindset/ paradigm shift, and this book did that for me.",1
"Robin's ""Outliers"" Review. ""Outliers"" is a thought provoking book discussing the events and environments that came together to give certain people the opportunity to be big successes, ie, the Bill Gates and Beatles of the world. It also discusses the reason why other people that should have been huge successes did not reach there potential.",1
Insightful. this book was an assignment for my English class.I wasn't to excited at first but as I read it really makes you think,1
"I'm left feeling a bit meh.... The author has done his research which speaks to the strengths of this book. At times it was hard to keep abreast of the points the author was making. Just like my review, it could have been condensed.",0
"Interesting and readable book. Gladwell's thesis is that certain people are successful by luck of their birth timing, their environments and given this luck, their hard work. This thesis is really not surprising. The book is well written and imminently readable.",1
"Interesting take on patterns we may or may not see. Mr. Gladwell authors and reads this text. It seems a hefty read so I am appreciative of this audio narrative format. The examples and cases cited in the text elaborate on his general thoughts and appear to be mostly thought out. There are several cases however, such as the folks in the Appalachians or the Chinese and mathematics, that seem quite a stretch and, for me, not entirely plausible. Not that they, or other cases, are lacking in evidence or researched argumentation, just that what is presented for some of the cases does not make convincing justifications for the thesis of that particular chapter (again, such as folks feuding in Appalachia or Chinese and mathematical ability). It's an interesting book and take on patterns we encounter in everyday life, but I just don't think the justification for each chapter's thesis was entirely plausible.",1
"Best spur buy I've done. I was bored in a 4 hour Saturday morning class about technology management. I've heard about this book and was curious about it on why I was so popular. I found out after a few pages in. Mr. Gladwell grabs you instantly and never lets go until the last page. There's so much knowledge, one you've finished, it changes perspectives and opinions. It was a great ride and I'm looking forward to many more from Mr. Gladwell.",1
"Highly recommend!. Incredibly interesting variety of stories that come together perfectly. Very well thought out, clear and concise. We'll researched and covers some topics very often brushed over. Excellent read.",1
"Read This If You Want To Improve Yourself. Super engaging, no boring chapters. Seriously, you won't regret the 7 1/2 hrs this book takes.",1
"Excellent book..remarkable!!. This book narrates a theory of success unlike no other. It provides the reader with research-based data, and real life anecdotes that keeps the reader interested and intrigued about what lies ahead!!",1
Read it !. It is brilliant and revealing of truths regarding excellence. So very well written . There 'a a rhythm to it.,1
Terrific. Are u ready to invest 10000 hrs of your time to become perfect.,1
"thought provoking. I really enjoyed this book. I definitely think differently about people with great success. Gladwell... If the opportunity presented itself, how many of us would be in a position to use out talents to rise to the top?",1
Cheese. Cheese,1
Worth the money. Nice,1
"Great Read. Such a great book, interesting perspective on success and high level achievements.",1
Three Stars. Awesome book. Riveting,1
Five Stars. It' a good book,1
Great book. This book is so fascinating. It opens ones mind to the reality of life and opportunities. Great book!,1
Good for thought. Whether you subscribe to Gladwells way of thinking you have to value his creative thought processes. He turns the simple upside down and then presents it on the most logical narrative. I love the way he thinks and read all his books. It's good mental exercise.,1
Really interesting reading. It explains a lot of different thing about differences.,1
Excellent read by a brilliant mind. Mr. Gladwell has a sensational way of breaking down complex ideas in a new way that's easily consumable and repeatable. I found myself repeating much of his findings and points in everyday conversation about success. Highly recommend and am continuing to read more by him.,1
"Fascinating theories. This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make ""greats"" great. The stories are fascinating, and worth a read. Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end. That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off. I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.",1
Out of the box. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand why success has eluded some people while others have a knack for finding it.,1
"Read it.. Now i need to find something i can invest 10,000 hours into.",1
"Inspiring book!. I love this book, plain and simple. I read this book once already borrowing from friend. But I could not stop myself from getting one for myself. The book help me refocus on the meaning of my life and what and how I can do to help me achieve it. Love it and would recommend anyone to read it.",1
Outstanding. This author clearly has a gift of drawing together diverse academic studies and weaving them into a narrative that is at once simple and complex. He succeeds in giving us a powerful picture of what makes people succeed.,1
"Discover your success. Once more, Malcolm Gladwell reveals the inner truths on how, and why, some of us excelled, and those left behind.",1
Insightful. This was a very Insightful book. The author is smart and did an impressive amount of research to achieve an undeniable truth to being an outlier. He is in fact himself an outlier from my point of view.,1
worth it. it was good and I gained insight because of it. a little boring. overall I would recommend it.,1
"Excellent book!. Amazing information on how and why great people triumph in life, besides stamina and dedication. Very convincig and extremely well documented.",1
Five Stars. My husband loved this book.,1
"thought provoking.. Most thought provoking book that I have read in a while. I would recommend this to my friends, and anyone that is looking for thinking out of the box.",1
"Interesting theory but not totally accurate. I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory. I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.",1
Four Stars. An entertaining mix of statistics and anecdotes.,1
"worst. Liked most of the book. The epilogue was misplaced, a little bit too wordy and repetitive. The goals of this book may be too idealistic but are worth working toward",1
Don't hesitate to buy this book. Great book from a great writer. Read this and you will be thinking about it on and off for years.,1
"The most eye opening thing I've read to date. I cannot think of a book more revealing or interesting than this one. Reading this inspired and baffled me. I found myself gasping numerous times at truths I couldn't believe, but were so obviously staring me in the face my whole life! I cannot say enough good things about it. I'm revitalized and ready to level up my business through what I know now must reach at least 10,000 hours of practice and some seriously good luck. Read this book. I guarantee you won't regret it. 👌🏼",1
"Terrific Read!. Gladwell does a remarkable job of connecting ideas that, at first glance, seem utterly unrelated. Step by step, Gladwell brilliantly dissects societal patterns to explain why various individuals were outliers in history. This book causes one to reflect on all the incredible opportunities and people in ones own story.",1
"Different perspective on personal success. My favorite parts here in this book are dedicated to educational systems and parenting, and what can be done about fixing the current state of things, so that more people could become successful at what they are doing academically.",1
"Great all around read. I really enjoy Mr. Gladwell's books. This books is no exception. Recommend it for anyone looking for a thought provoking, easy to read book.",1
"Curious as why past or current events have occured?. Proposes several observations and how these observations are to be evaluated. In short, have you wondered ""why"" as to a pass or current event? This book provides material that may assist in answering your question. AND, may be of value going forward.",1
"I expected something different. I love Malcolm's storytelling ability, his interest in odd behavior, creative story sourcing, etc. This book had all those things.",1
Amazing. I really enjoyed this book on my way to work everyday. Insightful and interesting. Consider increasing the speed if you find that its's read too slowly as I did.,1
Best !!!!. Enjoyed every bit of this book,1
"The kind of book that makes adults fight like toddlers over a toy!. This book is amazing! Entertaining and eye opening, Gladwell keeps a great red thread throughout the book. This copy has been passed around amongst my friends and several are waiting for their turn to read it! Definitely the kind of book that I would buy as a gift or have several copies of, to lend/give to friends and family!",1
Open your mind.. Great work and reference points.,1
Five Stars. Great insight into success. Quite a revelation and once you know it kind of seems obvious. Would recommend.,1
"""The Outliers"" provides insightful analyses of the roots of success, particularly highlighting those that are not intuitively ob. This book is both theoretically interesting and also practically useful. I recommend it particularly for young people, who can relate its lessons to decisions they must make during critical years of personal development.",1
"Interesting. This was a pretty interesting book. I don't agree with all of the reasoning, but it's an interesting theory.",1
Well done.. Very interesting 🤔.,1
"Perspective changes. This book starts out kind of slow with basic definitions and examples of outliers. Being a statistics guy, I found this redundant. However, the author strategically does this to build the plot and the theme behind the entire book. The way we analyze outliers and success stories in general, is completely flawed. Gladwell provides numerous examples as to why our mindset is flawed and backs it up with irrefutable research from different fields. If you're a hard worker but feel like you just can't seem to find a break, then this book is for you. Not only will it motivate you but it will refuel your persistence in the goal of ultimately achieving success.",1
Five Stars. great quality,1
Excellent.. Great book! a definite must read to understand the nature of success and the application of these ideas to our lives.,1
"interesting analysis. I thought it was a great book. I am glad that the author read it. The book was great until the conclusion where it seemed that he bent the stats and stories to fit his conclusion. Even with this issue it was a great analysis and story. I loved the way he showed the connections between the history, chance of time, hard work, ethnicity, and good choices.",1
A new perspective to success. This book talks about successful people and how everything around them helped them get there. There were a few chapters that were stretched just to make a point. Certain chapters like the first one where the author keeps on talking about hockey players born in January was very slow and boring. but the latter ones with software entrepreneurs was very interesting. Malcolm Gladwell doesn't say anything new here except for the fact that every individual needs to work hard and practice makes perfect. The only difference here is the amount of research the author has gathered is remarkable and many of his facts and researches prove a point. The epilogue chapter was completely unrequired. I gave a 4 rating beacuse of those certain unrequired chapters. Great research and a good book to read once.,1
"Great book identifying the benefits of understanding your own opportunities and where hard work will take you.. Some people may read this book and see success as a series of being born at the right time, being given the right opportunities, and having the right supporting cast growing up. For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us. Some things we can change and some we can't, so we might as well work with what we can change and control.",1
Very Engaging. Fascinating - could not stop listening. Well constructed arguments for why success happens or doesn't.,1
"Great Read, Faded Pages. Several pages were faded beyond the point of being legible. It's worst on page 245 for me, shame the return date just passed.",0
"Great Read for fans of Freakonomics!. Great book- very insightful, non-traditional approach. If you liked the Freakonomics books, you'll like this one as well. I'm looking forward to reading his other books.",1
"Great Story. I really enjoyed the argument,but he seems to argue in the end that the individual isn't responsible for their success. I agree that success doesn't happen in a vacuum, nothing does,but there is something to be said about some people who seize opportunity and work hard,because there are many who choose not to.",1
Loved it! Highly recommended!. Loved it so much I sent it to a friend. The interview at the end was great!,1
"Causes one to stop and think. Really an interesting read! I can't quite ""buy"" some of his theories but it is so thought-provoking that I passed it along for all my adult kids to read, too.",1
"Life Changing Book. My mom begged me to read this book. I hesitated. She insisted and bought me the CDs. I have now begged everyone I know to read or listen to this book. This is LIFE CHANGING!!!! It's been about a 6 months since I listened to the CDs and I talk about the content to someone at least once each week. I look at the world differently now. Buy it, buy it, buy it. (and no, I am not being paid to say this)",1
"Forget statistics. Read it for what it is.. I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.",1
Excellent book. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting as I couldn't put it down. Interesting and thought-provoking.,1
Pretty good. nice,1
"The Book Outliers is a Must Read. Malcolm Gladwell is a must read for Parents, Teachers, Coaches, and others that help develop children. Malcolm has done a terrific job at linking the true traits of success in developing future leaders in business and sports. Thanks, David Eldridge, Marketing Director of RedSunDomains.com",1
"A read to remember. The beauty of Outliers is it's detailing. Malcolm Gladwell take you through a journey a amazing revelations with analysis, data, history. The way each of his ideas unfold is mind-blowing. The chapters that involves plane crashes, asian maths, the 10000 hour rule, concerted cultivation are something to ponder on for a long time.",1
Required MBA Reading. If you want an MBA you'd better read this book. If you already have an MBA you'd better read it.,1
"Fascinating and enjoyable. Although some of Gladwell's assertions are subject to debate, there is no doubt that they are well presented and certainly make good ""food for thought"".",1
"Thought Provoking Read. More than once I thought of Acts 17:26 while reading Outliers. The NLT translation says, ""From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries."" God sets the time and place for us to be born, it is up to us to partner with him for our high calling to be fulfilled. Therein lies the Outlier secret. Very thought provoking book, I will never forget the 10,000 hour rule of mastery, and strive to reach it in order to do what I was made for, while I can.",1
It is a good one. It gives me a lot of understanding about our destiny: how the past and the environment -a background we little think about - shape our life.,1
interesting read. Loved the first plot and understood the idea of the book and then different themes added the same thought.,1
Need More. Great listen. Didn't want it to end. The data seemed neutral and unbiased. Absolutely loved it.,1
"Success has more to do with luck than I ever thought. This guy is good. I didn’t like blink, I stopped reading it... I wrote this guy off. Then I ended up reading David and Goliath because it sounded compelling and it blew me away. Outliers follows that same reaction. It is all the things I never knew about something I thought I knew everything about. Success is way more than just being the smartest or the hardest worker. I might read blink now.",1
"How Success Happens. A better understanding of background, constraints, industriousness, and happenstance converge to create or stiffle success!",1
"A Star Is Born--Literally!. Genius may not be enough. In Outliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell credits success to coincidence and timing. How close in age were the Founding Fathers? What technological wizards were contemporaries in age? Which award-winning athletes are born in the first few months of a calendar year? And why does this matter? These are among the questions that Gladwell raises (and answers) to account for success. As with all Gladwell's Best Sellers, his premises are thoughtful and thought-provoking.",1
"Brilliantly written and gripping read. Fabulous, it is brilliantly written, gripping read with meaningful conclusions. Really thought provoking, from one of the finest non fiction writer if our time.",1
"Who knew? Data applied to our lives. Great tales of the human condition, and how rare and unusual facts contribute to our world and the people who live on this mortal coil.",1
Best Gladwell Book. I really love it when authors read their own books well. Gladwell's voice feels like having a chat with an incredibly smart friend.,1
Five Stars. Good read.,1
"What does it take to succeed?. In this book Gladwell masterfully displays that it takes more than hard work to be very successful. Luck and surroundings play a very important part. You can't get anywhere without hard work, but you also can't get anywhere if your surroundings are working against you. I tend to like Gladwell's sweeping explanations, but at the end he brings it down to a more personal level, which I think helps the reader/listener understand his theory on a micro scale.",1
Five Stars. Good information!!!,1
"Simply Amazing!. Is truly a great book and one that you really need to read if you're starting your career and want to be successful. It helps you embrace your ethnicity, cultural background and other personal ""baggage"" and realize the good and the bad of the hand you got dealt. The best part is that gaining that awareness will help you create a plan to compensate or potentialize these subtleties of your own history.",1
"Excellent book. I bought this book for my son, who will be reading it this year in his high school psychology class. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Mr. Gladwell presents some very intriguing insights into success that I had never before considered. The book is well written, making it interesting and easy to read. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to expand their thinking.",1
"Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to. One of those books that subtly changes you and your outlook on the world. Using anecdotes, riveting details, and data, Gladwell has planted the idea in my head that the world we have is not by coincidence or sheer dumb luck. We have the ability to change ourselves and our world, and become outliers too. There is no magic secret. It means looking at ourselves, at work habits, our cultural legacy and asking ourselves some hard questions. Gladwell's thesis is inescapable and puts the responsibility on each of us to create a better world and a better self.",1
"excellent. Malcolm Gladwell always does such an excellent job of providing food for thought, of taking old ideas and looking at them again with fresh eyes.",1
Enjoyable Book; Don't full-heartedly agree with underpinning generalization. PROs,1
GOOD READ!. Book came on time and in a good condition. I loved reading this book! Author is a genius. It is about factors of success in America.Such an eye opener.,1
"revealing. The best book I ever read!!! Best in that it explained a lot of things about success, opportunities and luck.",1
One of my all time favorites. I love this book and how Gladwell's witty mind works. It kept me interested all the through...well done Mr. Gladwell,1
Not as I had thought. The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,1
"Fascinating and Compelling Read. I have loved all of Gladwell's books, but this one perhaps the best. This book like his others gives one a new way to look at what is happening in the world. He takes questions that many people have wondered about and gives some unexpected answers with research to back up his findings.",1
Five Stars. Great book!! Priceless!,1
"Awesome book. Great book, really enjoyed the premise and the supporting stories! Gladwell makes the stories come to life!",1
Great non-fiction read.... I bought this book as a present for a friend. I read it some time ago and just loved it.....,1
"Very Engaging. Some listeners found the book too simplistic. But, that was precisely why i liked it. I felt that his simple, engaging narrative makes the rather complex ideas very easy to understand, absorb and remember.I went back and listened to his previous two books and I liked those too. But, I enjoyed this one the most. Besides, the author narrating the book makes it even more enjoyable.",1
"Some interesting insights, but more proof needed. Gladwell has some very interesting insights into success and I must admit that it opened my eyes to the background of successful people. However, many of the relationships touted between success and social factors are correlative, I would have liked to see him expound further to elucidate the causal relationship.",1
Amazing book. He develops his points in a subtle but shrewd way. Uses great examples from different areas. generally great writing as well,1
Good read. Good read,1
"Makes you really think---very good book. I really enjoyed this very interesting book. I read it and listened to it (from my library audio app) at the same time. Fascinating research on how circumstances, opportunities, family and culture affect the success of a person. Loved the chapter on the airplane pilots and their cultural differences, loved the chapters on opportunities to ""practice"" something 10,000 times....just a very readable, interesting book. I highly recommend it. Loved his ending chapter about his own family culture and how they were shaped by opportunity, etc.",1
Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read!. Malcolm Gladwell keeps writing books I have to read! Love his concepts and research.,1
Just wow!. stupendous,1
"Don't Jump To Conclusions. Don't get offended by his observations/data, endeavour to listen for new understandings and personal growth.",1
amazing. The book is so enlightening. I enjoyed all chapters. perfect length and inspiring stories. must read,1
Good but way to long. I got some great info out of this book. It’s just very long winded and drawn out. The info learned could have been said in a few chapters.,0
Great Book. Interesting facts that make us look at success in a different point of view! Highly recommendable for all of those who are obsessed with the lives of successful people.,1
insightful indeed!. Story of success is a classic read and has been an eye opener for me. Success truly is not only result of luck or opportunity alone but what you do of the luck or opportunity...,1
"Exceptional: Much Better and With Greater Breadth Than Anticipated. It took me a long time to pick up a copy of Outliers to read. I had read many of the print media reviews when the book came out and most, unfortunately, focused on the role of birth month on one's ""success."" I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.",1
awesome and inspiring.. will definitely be listening to this audio book again.,1
Highly recommended. Outstanding Book,1
thought provoking. What an amazingly insightful book. There is the occasional dull paragraph or maybe me being tired and therefore not concentrating! This makes you evaluate things in a different light! Highly recommend this! Almost nature versus nurture type debate.,1
"Great read.. Wonderful. However, I believe there is more to success than being the right person in the right place and the right time.",1
"Great read. As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, I wasn't surprised that I loved this book. I would recommend this as it is a great read.",1
Five Stars. Thank You,1
Four Stars. good.,1
"outliers. I believe the book was excellent, and provided a unique insight has to how little things multiply to create signifcant happenings when the collective source of them are pooled together. I would recommend the book to my friends.",1
Five Stars. Great book. Worth it.,1
"Psychology of Success. The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born. These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.",1
Excellent. Well thought out and articulated arguments about the stories behind true success. This book will make you think. Makes me grateful for the opportunities I’ve had in my life.,1
"the 10,000 hour rule.... 10,000 hour rule; a person must love a ""profession"" so much to have that many hours by adulthood. it's baffling to love something that much. a parent who would push a kid to that many hours of practice would make a kid hate a subject, or so it seems.. these are a special breed, hence the title, ""outliers"". Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors and I recommend any books of his that you can get your hooves on....",1
Educational.. Very informative.,1
"Five Stars. amazing read, everybody needs to read this book!",1
"Surprisingly one of the best audiobooks .... Loved it. One of the more interesting takes on greatness. And towards to end, very personalized.",1
"One of the best!. This is book reads/narrates like a series of short stories that illustrate a larger concept, that hard work and opportunity rather than ambition alone make for success. Outliers is my favorite business/success book yet. Love it and highly recommend for anyone, entrepreneur or otherwise.",1
Book. Good book,1
Five Stars. very good book. this is the first English book I read through page by page.,1
"Acknowledging success as it really is in reality. Although the book is a bit long for its core message, it is a great read.",1
"An interesting read. A step back from the focus on personality and a humbling examination of the role of culture, chance and kindness in the making of those who achieve great things. Easy and enjoyable to read, I would recommend this book.",1
Five Stars. Great read! Makes you think about destiny versus determination and the combination of both.,1
Fascinating. Such an interesting read full of various stories of success and luck. It's captivating to read since it examines an array of cultural and societal factors for success.,1
"Good. Hi, this book is pretty good, but some of his reasoning is off. It's very entertaining though. This isn't really a book of facts, just well-defended opinions.",1
"Classic Book. Even after reading this book a second time years later, the content is still original and entertaining. We often think that outliers (those special, exceptional people) are disciplined, self-made successful people. That is not the case. It is the environment, support system, and other factors that can make an ordinary person into an extraordinary person. I recommend skipping chapters 6 and 7 about family feuds in the Appalachian and South Korean airplane crashes and coming back to at the end. Those chapters demonstrate how culture can be a detriment to a person's success.",1
"Great, quick read.. What a way to put success into perspective! This book points out what success looks like and what serendipity looks like. Little life lessons presented in an easy, readable format. Great for anyone with a toddler going off to pre-school to a teenager going off to college. This is not a self-help book. Instead, it is a book of anecdotes that, when put together, illustrate what some successful people have in common.",1
A paradigm shift. Malcom Gladwell unravels the notion of genius in a methodical and indisputable journey. A most interesting and thought provoking listen.,1
Good. Good,1
"Love anything written by Malcolm Gladwell. So interesting, wish the book was longer! I had borrowed this book from the library. Liked it so much, I ordered a copy for a friend.",1
"Great Book, exceeded expectations. This book struck my interest based on the recommendation of a peer. The book itself reads smoothly, is well researched with lots of facts and statistics and the anecdotes within are informative and entertaining. The unique stories of Bill Gates, The Beatles and Canadian hockey all stars are all fascinating. I highly recommend picking this book up, it's a quick and informative read.",1
It's okay. It has good moments.,1
"Outstanding!!!. My brother recommended this, thinking I would appreciate it. I have never read anything like it. Thanks to him, many others have read it, including my author son, Russell Rowland. Thank you, Lee Arbuckle!",1
Five Stars. great book although his philosiphy is ver much based on statistics @lanarose.96,1
"Excellent book!!!!!!!. This was a very enjoyable listen. Extremely informative -- as a Canadian, I now plan on having my kids in the first few months of the year (you'll understand once you've read the book). Empowers you to feel that you too can be great. Gladwell himself narrates the book and his voice is clear and soothing. A definite recommendation to friends.",1
Great read. Very thought provoking book that is a really fun and enjoyable to read while providing some unique insights into many subjects.,1
"I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. I have always thought of myself as somewhat of an outlier and it was interesting to read this book for me. It is really interesting how our world and society as we know it shapes us. I like how the author used examples from a few different aspects that really made me think even more. Very though provoking! I followed this book with ""Where Good Ideas come from"" and suggest to to anyone purchasing this book.",1
A Must listen book. Complex ideas explained clear with examples that are easily memorable so that enlighted topics last in mind.,1
Four Stars. Great book!,1
Analytical. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in behavioral economics or redefining the road to success,1
Gladwell Strikes Gold ...Again. I am astounded every time I read one of Gladwell's books. His insights are unusual and thought-provoking.,1
"Pick it up and read it!. I am a real fan of Malcolm Gladwell. This book is another home run, in my opinion. His revelations about human behavior are always interesting, make sense and are surprising, nonetheless. He thinks outside of the box. Every parent and teacher should read ""Outliers"" for insight into what goes into success and how little things can help or hinder all of us. I find his books so interesting that I usually read them twice. If you have never read Gladwell, pick this one up and then work your way through his other books.",1
Should have read this sooner. A good look at the factors needed to success. Gives you an idea of how you need to think going forward so you can expand your horizons and increase your chances of succeeding in whatever your goal is.,1
"Fascinating take on many modern topics. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's, but what a great intro. He takes a view of modern phenomenon and cuts to the heart of the issues which aren't the ones that you would expect. I particularly enjoyed the elements of cultural influence and how that influence persists over generations. I am practically applying the book by teaching my children numbers in Japanese as it could very well help them break down math more quickly.",1
"Outliers is Outstanding!. In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary. He proposes that 10,000 hours of practice make us outstanding; that's why The Beatles -who played on stage in Hamburg for 270 days, 8 hours a day make their special sound, or why the Hockey players born in january-febraury had more chances of make it to NHL (because they are closer to start date). Very interesting, but it could be called ""The 10,000 hours rule to be an outlier.",1
"This book  OUTLIERS is interSeting. However, it could be much clearer if reframed in the idea/truth of REINCARNATION.. - WHERE certan attributes are passeed on from one incarnation to another",0
"Enjoyable.. I enjoyed it, but not as much as the rave reviews it got.",1
"GREAT BOOK ON SUCCESS. Success and in general, human behaviour, is not an isolated incident. Malcolm goes to such great extent to explain how different circumstances had to be in place in order for a specific outcome to be achieved. Some of these are deliberate while others are unavoidable.",1
Great listen. Enjoyed the entire book thoroughly. He takes you on a journey to many parts of the world and makes a strong case for the theory of success. Fantastic.,1
excellently written and delivered!. awesome book! this is a must read for those few who are serious about success and what is truly needed. become an outlier!,1
Four Stars. Gladwell is fun reading.,1
"Nice explanations on societal norms. The book is easy to read and provide interesting insights. Although most of the writings are purely observations and co-related anecdotes, it is engaging and worth the time.",1
"Great buy. Great book.. This book will open your eyes and give you another look at what makes successful people. Really interesting! I have kids with late birthdays to I can relate the information concerning Canadian hockey players. My son is a dec birthday .... Guess what... He did not excel at hockey that had a dec 31 cutoff date. Even if you do not agree with everything, it does give you a new perspective and makes you think.",1
"Outliers. This was a fascinating read. Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me. The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation. If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too. This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you. It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward. Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.",1
"Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking. Great book. Very interesting and thought provoking, giving you insight into a multitude of different factors that contribute to success that society often over looks. The book itself was in perfect condition.",1
"Fabulous thinking outside the box...many mysteries of life explained. Terrific book... I have referenced it (and Gladwell's other books) many times in speeches, conversations and in my own books.",1
Really good book. The examples about 10000 hour book were .... Really good book. The examples about 10000 hour book were nice. His other book david and goliath is also good,1
A clever piece of work which reminds us that we .... A clever piece of work which reminds us that we are part of a web of events and happenstances that work to make us successful. Very enjoyable reading.,1
"Outliers. I think it is an exceptional book, as it reveals aspects about human behavior not commonly known by the average man in the street. The value of ""Outliers"" in my view is that the Thesis of the author is not a fair-fetched one, but something that anyone could apply in daily life, for practical purposes.",1
This is among the best of them. All of Gladwell's books are well worth reading. This is among the best of them. Mr. Gladwell is a good writer and writes in an interesting style. I recommend this and all of his books.,1
"Fabulous...just as you would expect!. Brilliant book, fabulous concepts, wonderful writing style.",1
Not factual. It is just writer's opinion without any scientific fact behind it. I understand it can be applied to many books in this genre but nowadays expectations are higher. If you want to be different from a yellow book you have to include historical or scientific facts. But stories were interesting and you won't get bored.,1
So far so good. I’ve only read the 1st chapter but it’s a great book so far.,1
"Outstanding Perspective. Gladwell puts forward the argument that some natural advantages (being slightly older at a young age) and a lot of hard work (10,000 hours to master a skill) give one a lot more change of success in life is not an unreasonable notion. By backing it up with analysis and multiple cases, creditability results. There is a strong enough case established to make his views worth reading and thinking about.",1
"Interesting on some theories, but a bit stretched on .... Interesting on some theories, but a bit stretched on some topics, and sometimes looking for the dotted lines. The writing is very journalistic, could be improved in flow.",1
Five Stars. Very Interest and thought provoking!,1
"and I thought it was an interesting book but there were parts that I found pretty boring. I did feel like I learned a .... I read Outliers, The Story of Success for a school summer reading assignment, and I thought it was an interesting book but there were parts that I found pretty boring. I did feel like I learned a lot throughout the book and was able to take away a lot, which was the point of the assignment. But there were chapters of the book I found very hard to concentrate because it wasn't very interesting. I felt like the book started out interesting, which I liked, but then towards the middle I found myself actually dozing off when the author talked about certain topics I was uninterested in. But over all I would recommend it to someone who is interesting in questioning the theory to success.",1
"GREAT!. THIS BOOK WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY AND IT WAS IN ""LIKE NEW"" CONDITION AS ADVERTISED. GREAT JOB!",1
There are no super humans. I'm so happy I heard about this book. it has changed my perspective on success,1
"Great subject. Powerful examples.. Very good subject, I am fully aligned with the core assertion that all of us are primarily result of circumstances and opportunities we get in life, but the author's treatment of this assertion neglects to highlight a core idea, that making the most of an opportunity is the responsibility of an individual. Talented or not, one must have the ability to persevere in order to succeed. Making relevant personal choices in a timely manner and being willing to pay the price for reaching a goal is as central to the idea of success as opportunity is. Foresight and conviction, open-mindedness and intrinsic drive, optimism and patience are all such traits that make a successful individual. Nature of an individual who just doesn't give a damn will always overpower the nurturing received from a caring set of parents or community that believes in them and wishes to invest in them. We can't just claim that an older sibling ends up more successful because they received the undivided attention of parents. That by definition would make older siblings more successful in a statistically significant way. However, that's not what we see. Even innate talent is useful for a person who doesn't show the aforementioned traits and an attitude for self-correction and life long learning.",1
Lucky or effort?. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities — and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.,1
boring book. I felt like he could say what he wanted to say in half an hour. The book basically talks about same things over and over. We know all this. Nothing new and nothing that will enrich my life.,0
"Well written, excellent read. Highly recommended.. Thought provoking ideas, challenging our very way of thinking about Success are explained simply and clearly. Well written. I wish to get latest version to understand some of recent successes in the internet field. Hope to find similar books to analyze success within Indian culture and context!",1
"Pointed & Personal. Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.",1
Great product! Super fast shipping!. Great product! Super fast shipping!,1
"The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of pe .... The novel, Outliers, explores the elements and circumstances of people who are considered successful in our society. From the world’s best hockey players to Steve Jobs, he concludes that success is ultimately the result of impeccable timing, cultural support, and lots of practice. The overall message of the book is that to become one of very few “outliers” in our society, people need much more than just talent. While practice is commonly regarded as the one and only way to perfection, Gladwell argues that there is a reason almost all of Canada’s best hockey players were born in January, February, and March. The random connections like this one fascinated me as I read the book. Outliers is undoubtedly a book that makes readers think. Gladwell doesn’t tell readers why the best hockey players were born at the beginning of the year, but instead, makes them try to figure it out themselves by offering data sets. After offering readers hints to figure out his enigmas, he finally reveals the answer which never failed to be unanticipated and compelling. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book. Readers are not only interested by the intriguing connections made by Gladwell, but also by the amazing, untold stories of some of the most successful humans in history. Gladwell's writing style is thought provoking and forces readers to think about everything differently. Have you ever wondered why some airlines are so much more prone to crashes than others? I certainly didn’t, but the answers to questions like these are surprising and not obvious. Gladwell’s amazing observations and questions enlighten readers and cause them to question the obvious explanations to everything. Overall, I would recommend this book to everybody. The fascinating stories and observations make the book a serious page turner and enthrall readers around the world.",1
Five Stars. SCHOOL BOOK,1
To all. You should be ashamed of yourselves. With the amount of knowledge you kids have its incredelous the lack of maturity you show. I ptomise to find out who you are so that you may be properly punished. Shame on you. This is a great book and by hacking into the reviews messes it up,1
"Fantastic book. Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer and an even better story teller, he showcases the geniuses and successful people of the world and just how they got to be where they are today. AMAZING!",1
"Best in the market!. Excellent book , delivered in good condition .. Although just 1 question ..why did you guys @flipkart stop giving out bookmarks ??",1
"There is nothing Extraordinary just opportunity. This book shines light on the perspective that many of the greats we celebrate are somehow untouchable, but Malcolm Gladwell brings the Outliers close enough to touch them... awesome book that makes you want to look for opportunities to succeed.",1
"Fascinating and contrarian. Gladwell is a great storyteller, and Outliers is both provocative and personal. If the book was read by anyone but the author (given its personal nature), it would have been less impactful.",1
"So interesting! Would recommend. It was a great book, highly recommended",1
"We can all be Outliers. From the Beatles to Robert Oppenheimer, and later understanding the cultivation of rice patties, this makes Outliers such an interesting read. The fundamental question in this book is, are geniuses really geniuses? Gladwell argues that it really where you are placed in society and maybe even luck in birth. This book was a fascinating read. Unfortunately sometimes Gladwell does not know how to end a chapter. Once a point is made, it is made. Overall, I did enjoy the book.",1
"All In Education Should Read This. This book should be an interesting read for anyone, but I particularly want to highlight the need for all educators to read it. Current educational policy needs a whack on the side of the head. (I write this as an experienced teacher neck deep in No Child Left Behind, and the policy makers' forcing ""research based strategies"" into our lesson plans.) Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily. But it does give the reader a chance to pull their head out of today's pervasive educational group think and consider alternatives.",1
"Highly Insightful. My husband and I listened to this book on a road trip and we LOVED it. Mr. Gladwell writes such interesting points that he has clearly researched. We both learned a ton from listening to Outliers and I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone interested.",1
"Good read. The book is very interesting and provides an entirely new perspective on the idea of success. I feel Gladwell stretches a bit too much at some points, but is an overall good read and would recommend it to anyone.",1
A rational and sober explanation of events which might otherwise seem miraculous. Provides accessible insight and great clarity without the need for grandiose language or overly complex analogies. Gladwell states his case with style and grace. Both informative and entertaining - worth the money.,1
"Gladwell Impresses Yet Again. What does your birthday have to do with the likelihood of you striking it rich as a technology CEO? Why do some very smart people succeed and other equally smart people fail? Is there more to success than simply talent and hard work? I don't want to say anything else lest I spoil Gladwell's carefully-researched answers, so I'll just say that you should read the book. It's a good one.",1
Five Stars. Loved it.,1
Five Stars. Enlightening and motivating read!,1
Five Stars. Came as expected! Thank you!,1
"Excellent. Should be read by policy makers. Intriguing readable and fascinating book which shows how luck, fortune and class interplay for creating success . I'm passing this on to so many people",1
"Anecdotal evidence. This book has an interesting concept and is well written if one likes to read newspaper articles. Given its author, its not suprising it is crafted in a journalistic style. However, it was an interesting read that proposes a believable theory of how people succeed through practice and fortitude.",1
"Thought Provoking. Gladwell has once again used his unique writing style, his meticulous research and his ability to tell a story to produce an eye opening and thought provoking book. I recommend this book to anyone who engages in out side of the box thinking.",1
hindi language. Provide hindi and english both language,1
Five Stars. great book full of wonderful stories and infos,1
Nice. Excellent book. Highly recommend,1
"Great Look Into What Makes Up Great Persons. After hearing ""Outliers"" mentioned by media outlets and social circles for years, I finally downloaded and read the book. This compilation of various Outliers in history and the circumstances that allowed them to become these outliers is presented in a unique and interesting perspective by Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys seeing an interesting perspective into what goes into making some one an outlier",1
Great book. The book has a lot of very inspiring stories on 'outliers'. You can view those successful people from very different angles. I agreed with the author that we often ignored some tiny but important steps of their success.,1
Highly recommended.. Very interesting book. Highly recommended.,1
"Four Stars. Interesting and engaging, although some may be offended by his views",1
"wondrful read. Loved it, it,s amazing how Gladwell pulls together facts and stories. Look forward to reading much more from this wonderful and stimulating author .",1
"A different book. I was told how good this book was so I purchased it. It is a different approach to the subject of doing well in ones work. It gives a good outlook on those who may not be considered ""winners"". It was a challenging book for sure and I would recommend it to all those who want to succeed in life.",1
"Thought provoking. One of the thoughts that came to me... educators everywhere should read this book and rethink their teaching methods if we want ""no child left behind"".",1
"this book really spoke to me on a personal level!. I found, as a creative person who didn't realize I was creative until after years and years, that this book was very affirming. It also helped me better understand ""how the world works."" Highly recommended.",1
Three Stars. nice book but too much text…some parts are bit boring,1
Good Read. Good Read.,1
"Gladwell's best. Gladwell's earlier books were one trick ponies. This one is not. Every chapter explains a different point, and the examples are appropriate. I recommend it.",1
One of the best books I have ever read. One of the best books I have ever read. Outstanding. Everyone should read it to understand how we are pre-programmed based on our families.,1
what creates success. very interesting study on what creates and allows some people to become fantastically successful,1
"Outliers: The Story of Success. An excellent study of why certain people or groups achieve success. When they are born, the 10,000 hour rule, etc. etc.",1
An Insight into the Puzzling Nature of Success. An insightful take on success. I particularly liked the multiple examples from different fields. The book kept me fully entertained on a long flight to San Francisco. Well worth the price!,1
Five Stars. A great read!,1
Entertaining parlor game book. Very interesting conclusions. Mind game with statistics. I would take some of the conclusions with a grain of salt as statistics can be manipulated to prove just about anything. Required reading for my college daughters Sociology course. I read it when she was finished and pointed out some of the errors in making conclusions.,1
"Great Book. What I took from this book is that success is largely based on practice and luck. It does a good job at showing how one seemingly minor decision can be the start to a career of success, without you ever knowing it then. It was a good book that seems often criticized by people claiming he twists his data to prove his theories, but a lot of what he says seems like common sense. For example the 10,000 hour rule. If you take it literally, you might think that 10,000 hours of practice magically results in success. That's an absurd criticism I've seen too much of. Take him seriously, and you'll understand that Gladwell isn't saying that at all.",1
I am more or a fiction reader and could not believe how great this book is. What a compelling read. A book that not only is interesting and engaging but also leaves you with something to think about. I am more or a fiction reader and could not believe how great this book is. Highly recommended.,1

"Great Book!. I purchased this book for my college English class; I dreaded reading this book. However, after reading it, I have got to thank my professor for choosing such a great book! There's a ton of facts in here that will blow your mind! This book is a must read! Defintely one of the best books I've read!",1
"Biased. If you know how easily statistics and be manipulated, then you’ll see right through this book. One sided approach to his stats and opinions from sports (sorry Mr. Gladwell, but hockey has periods, not quarters) to his reviews in college academics. Some may be true or have a correlation but the easiest way I can explain the bias is just because it correlates doesn’t mean it causes it.",0
"Greatness ""lies"".... Gladwell's Outliers speaks to a great divide that exists in our culture, in that we can all be successful if we take the given examples Gladwell lays out in this book. Only we've become so occupied in that only certain individuals are gifted, that we fail to see greatness in each person.",1
Five Stars. a1,1
"Worth the Investment. Outliers made it to the #1 spot as a national bestseller, and it's well deserved. It is interesting, clearly written, and the argument is logically presented and, for the most part, well supported. The book's central ideas are 1) that brain power, character, and motivation are overrated; 2) other factors—often not easily recognized or not given enough significance—such as where and when a person was born, his or her family history, and the particular twists of fate and coincidences in a life story, are integral to the success (or failure) of an individual.",1

Very interesting!. Love the way Malcolm Gladwell writes!,1
Four Stars. thought provoking,1
"Creative outlook on how to obtain success. Great analysis and well written. Different way to seek success and understand its causes and implications. If you are a business person, you will love this book.",1
chefjoewead. This was probably the most eye-opening Book I've ever read! Absolutely unbelievable! Malcolm Gladwell knocked it out of the park!,1
interesting but overwhelming in mundane facts. It presented topics that benefit high society to understand why lower class people are at a disadvantage. The book was okay but not great. I could have gone without reading this long drawn out argument.,1
great read. Students of human nature will enjoy the footwork and research that went into this book and how much it explains about success and how much luck is involved in the outlying regions,1
Spot On. Gladwell reiterates what we know already. In such an eloquent manner! Intelligence paired with the right resources gets you to where you need to be. To be that outlier who gets the world’s attention,1
Very insightful!. This book helped to bring a new frame of reference. The way outliers become who they are and their path was very intriguing. Definitely a good read!,1
"Excellent - It will make you think.. This book is different from the type of book I usually read but I really enjoyed the book. Outliers is a book about the reasons some people are successful in life or not successful. The date when a person is born, the 10,000 hour rule, Jewish lawyers and their success in the 70's and 80's, air plane pilots and the country in which they were born are all some of the outliers which the author discusses in full. What the book really does is make you look at your own life and wonder how your successes and failures are tied to things in which you had no control. I strongly urge everyone to read this book. It will keep your interest and make you think.",1
amazing.... amazing and informative text about the true nature of outliers and the significance of community and culture,1
"Well argued, a view I held.. Well argued. I related given my rural black South African upbringing. Have seen over and over how environment shaped the citizens.",1
Three Stars. Read for school about success puts different perspective on success!,1
"Very good read. Certainly an enlightening book. Gladwell's writing certainly suits his purpose, and after you finish the book you'll have a new perspective on ""great"" people.",1

"Very Well Articulated.. The writing is simply spectacular, and Orwell does a great job of explaining the sociological elements that can determine success and failure. I've read it a couple of times, and it is inspiring each time. This is definitely a recommended read for anyone.",1
"Thoughts worth considering. I enjoyed reading the book. It made me re-think how I perceive abilities to perform certain types of work. It also brings forth the idea that the most commonly help view of intelligence is was too simplistic and that we must consider emotion, social, and other forms of intelligence beyond logic or pattern recognition. Many times we put our own barriers in front of ourselves and take away opportunities to try new things because we think ""only someone like ___ could do that"".",1

Incredible. I loved this book. I manage to read the whole book in one week. I couldnt put it down. Very interesting about different opportunities,1

"Collectivist tripe, don’t waste your time. Gladwell attacks a strawman idea of individualism. This is the literary equivalent of President Obama’s “you didn’t build that“ statement.",0
Four Stars. So happy to have finally received this book. My only issue is that the cover is bent.,1
Open mind. Over all it’s a very good book I love the attention to detail and how Gladwell always has something to back up his argument,1
"Not a perfect book. There are some great concepts in this book. However, I do not agree with all of the research supposedly backing these concepts. Sloppy research with few counterarguments. I wish there was more in that regard. Read it if you are deep into self development. Everyone internalizes things differently. You may reach an essentially revelation for your own respective life.",1
"How time and opportunity intersect. The premise of Mr Gladwell's book is that great achievement is partially determined by when are where you were born. This in itself will come as no surprise but the author succeeds in making a science of it. For example, if you wanted to be part of the computer revolution, 1955 USA was the best time and place to be born. All the major founders of Apple and Microsoft were born between 1953-1957 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both born perfectly in 1955. That is not the only example but I have read other books of this author and this is another fascinating read. Highly recommend.",1
Super!. good,1
Gifted. Sent as a gift,1

Five Stars. Amazing book,1
"Debunking the myth of ""self-made men"".. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book.  So appreciative to hear a voice of humility amid all the boasting arrogance of success. Thank you for setting the record straight.",1
"Unique and refreshing.. Malcolm argues that success is not achieved by extraordinary individuals that set out to achieve it out of pure desire. Instead, extremely successful stories are derived from a compound set of events that play out over a long period of time (sometimes it takes generations) and is maximized by the individuals to harvest the potential of what was put in front of them.",1

"Shines a light on bias, nature vs nature. Brilliant book, you'll love this if you like books such as Freakonomics",1
"Sensible.. Nice application of tons of data to a truism: none of us ""makes it"" alone.",1
"Overrated. I will start with the good, to which there is plenty. One, the author is a great narrator and added value by reading himself. He is a great story teller and the listening experience is quite enjoyable. Plus it gets the reader thinking about what causes success and makes an argument that is not often expressed outright - basically no man is an island and no one is a truly self-made man. Lots of great examples throughout the book to support the argument.",1
"Completely facinating. Wow, anyone who teaches or is in business should read this book. It opens your eyes as to demographics and why some people succeed and others fail. For example, the National Hockey League is full of January through March birthdays because the cut off date is typically January 1st for youth leagues. The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5. Plus, once they get going at that age, the older kids make higher levels (traveling teams), thus better coaching and more ice time. This applies to school, other sports, and other facets of life.",1
Success. Amazing book. I'm not one to read but this book got me excited to read. If you love anything to do with success this is the book for you,1
"Great read. Thought provoking, well researched, and entertaining. Brings up numerous good points regarding how society helps in the development of successful people. However, he minimizes the drive and hard work of individuals within groups who had same opportunities yet pushed themselves to success.",1
Great syorytelling. I really enjoyed this book. The style of storytelling used was captivating making what would normally be a very dry subject interesting. I learned some very interesting things about success and the role of our environment in that success. I also find myself looking at successful people differently.,1
Love it. Love it,1
"Stating the Obvious - Missing the Outliers. Since the publication of the ""Tipping Point"" I have used Gladwell's book in many of my lectures and required reading for graduate students. Yet just as I was delighted with that work, I was equally disappointed with ""Outliers."" His findings stated the obvious. Parental support combined with opportunity/chance provides the landscape for amazing success stories. Are these outliers or merely the results of strong parental support? Certainly culture, environment, and other variables combined play a role in success. It would seem that the true outliers would be those that came from lower income families. These families were concerned with economic survival that no time was available to support the educational needs of their children. When children from this background and despite the odds achieved success, they would truly be the outliers. From the perspective of ""Outliers"" we shouldn't waste any time whatsoever with them, they can't possibly succeed!",0
"Yes, Society is Screwing You; Find Out Just How Bad It Is. This was an utterly fascinating book about the secret factors that contribute to individual success. We are told to be smart, savvy and take advantage of opportunities, but factors like what time of year you're born, what decade you're born in, the circumstances of your education, and other factors beyond our control have a great deal to do with how successful we can become. This will amaze you, and if you're thinking about it, you'll get mad at how your circumstances determine who you can become. After a certain point you'll read this book for pointers on how to screw the system that is screwing you. The discouraging thing is that virtually no one makes it who has not worked hard and done their homework, but most people will be stopped hard by factors they can do nothing about. I have read several Malcolm Gladwell books and have been consistently pleased by the numerous examples and behind-the-scenes exposes that he consistently highlights. You have long suspected that society is a rigged game, but the extent to which society is jerking you around must be seen to be believed. An enlightening, maddening book that should be required reading for every high school student.",1
"We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?. There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application. But these stories are very illustrative of the points Mr. Gladwell is attempting to help us see with clarity.",1
Malcolm Gladwell has scored another winner. Gladwell is a refreshing writer who in not too many words,1
Gladwell's finest work so far.. This is probably one of Gladwell's defining works. He digs into why the kind of success that creates what we perceive to be those outliers like Bill Gates is usually a whole lot more than just serendipity. Highly recommended. I'd argue that this work is as much a philosophical piece as it is scientific or business.,1
good ideas terrible book. good for people who want reasons to justify there failures. would not recommend this book.,0
A good exploration of the recipe for success.. An easy read. sets up principle early and builds on them at a good pace throughout the rest of the boom.,1
this one is a must-own!. I read this book a few years ago and it has continued to be a book I think about. I still talk about it to my friends and colleagues because the perspective is so helpful and valid during many conversations. Its a great book!,1
Gladwell is always interesting.... I always enjoy Gladwell's books. Always great subject matter. While not my favorite of his books I still highly recommend.,1
"Outliers has some interesting concepts and is certainly thought provoking, but after a few chapters you 'get the idea' and can lose interest.. Outliers has some interesting ideas and concepts, but some of the charts and research get a bit redundant. Once you sort of 'get' where the author is going, it is difficult to continue to read. I enjoyed some of the ideas and this book did stimulate some good discussion among my friends who also read the book. I would have preferred to wait for a paperback and not bought this in hard cover. Some of the chapters seemed almost 'added on' to lengthen the book once the idea was presented.",0
Five Stars. Very interesting reading:-),1
"Great condition!. Even though the paper on the outside of the hardback showed some wear, the book itself is in great condition. The hardback and the pages showed no wear, and I am very pleased with the purchase.",1
Four Stars. Great narrative style with interesting examples to drive point home,1
I loved this book. This is great and relaxing reading for non fiction. I thought it would be geared mostly to business but as an educator I really enjoyed it.,1
Thought provoking. Good to read and reread frequently- makes you realize how much more you could be accomplishing. Highly recommend for those who feel capabile but not focused yet.,1
Great read. Easy read and enjoyed the subject matter,1
"I do not like to read, but when I do I read ........ Loved the down to earth tone when talking about some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they"" ACT ""on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...",1
"Take away value. This is an excellant book about factors we can control and those we can't. It is great for parents, mentors, and professionals seeking to excel. I've given each of my children one of these books and recommended it for many of my friends and colleagues.",1
"This is a great book.. After I read the book, my view of success has been enhanced. Mr. Gladwell does a wonderful job of helping his readers analyze and understand how people becomes top performers in their chosen fields.",1
"Very good book. Revealing truths that will help you move forward and motivate you to get better spite of your ""limitations""",1
This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. The insights which are constructed on top of careful research are ground breaking and shook my previous understanding of how success comes about to its very foundation. Part one of the book entitled Opportunity is very well written and I sailed through the 5 chapters in record time.,1
"Clearly written abstract concepts. Malcolm is one of the greatest minda of our time. He writes in a concise, clear style. He enables readers to understand abstract doncepts.",1
"Fun and Informative Book. It was really fun to read it, and talks about different topics in an interesting writing.",1
Worth your time. I very much enjoyed this book. It allows you to look at success from a different perspective,1
"Intriguing. Have you ever been jealous of someone else's success or wanted to be as successful as some wealthy or talented celebrity? According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book, Outliers, chances are if you were born at the right time of the year, and the right time of the century, have luck on your side and are willing to work lots, you, too, can be on the cover of Forbes Magazine. In short, if you thought success was all about being innately amazing, this book will change your thinking. And even better, I recommend this book, with only a few reservations. he first chapter of the book talks about why almost all pro hockey players are born in the first three to four months of the year.  A large part of hockey is being able to push each other around. Therefore being older and most often bigger than others is a huge advantage.  These older and therefore bigger kids then get chosen for the travel team with the best coach and they get the most playtime. And after a few seasons of preferential treatment these kids are superior. nother huge part of success, that is largely unexplainable, is straight up luck. Why did Bill Gates's middle school's mothers' club choose to buy a state of the art computer? What if he had been born just two years earlier and the technology did not exist when he got to middle school? Or what if he had been born two years later so that by the time he was in middle school, the demand for computers was so high that it was tough for kids to get time on the system? He might not have gotten all that time that he easily snatched right up. As you can see much of success is pure luck. But the biggest reason Bill Gates succeeded is because he went on to practice his programming. ust because of when you are born does not trump practice, and the book even agrees. For example, if you have 10,000 hours of practice by the time you are eighteen, you will be a pro at what you are doing. Want some real world examples? Just look at Tiger Woods, Bill Gates or Bill Joy. The amount that Bill Gates and Bill Joy worked from the time they started programming in late middle and early high school is enormous. The stories that Joy tells of all the time he put in programming blows your mind when you realize there was absolutely nothing else going on in this kid's life. This young programmer and his colleagues loved what they did. So they did it lots, and lots and lots! And, look at them now, they're really successful.  would definitely recommend this book particularly to students because of the stress that some undergo from worrying about the future. But I will warn you, it may get a bit tedious at points. Gladwell's writing can go off in tangents. However, I'm glad I read it and was able to add some awesome information to my repertoire. So go ahead, read on!",1
Interesting treatment of a complex subject. The book is a good treatment of the background forces that influence success or failure of several individuals. It is very interesting to learn how seemingly unrelated background issues can have a dramatic effect on the outcome of stressful situations. I've often suspected this was true and it is good to read corroborating evidence.,1
"Good read. The book was great. It was delivered on time and come in perfect condition. Very interesting to read the little stories in it, quite eye opening. Overall I would recommend this book to others that all looking for a little something different than a regular fiction book.",1
Eye opener. It used real life very relatable examples to understand the main purpose of the book.,1
"Outliers Are Not Really Outliers. I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed. The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair. Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November. It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year. Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children. They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year. However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year. As the school years pass, the gap widens. A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform. Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",1
"Five Stars. Great book, from a great author.",1
Great Read!. Wonderful book. Very informative and motivating. Shows that there is more to success than what we perceive. No one man is an island and the cards that you are delt can make or break your progress in life.,1
"Great book. Great book, with lots of interesting facts that make you think why people are so good at what they do. I won't give you more details because otherwise I will spoil the fun",1
"Interesting, but Selective Evidence. This is a book with lots of interesting and entertaining stories which shed some light on how culture affects and propels geniuses to greatness. Unfortunately it is also a collection of very selective evidence, linked by faulty reasoning, which leads to a book of some wisdom but a lot of false statements and beliefs.",0
Inspirational. Great viewpoint of what may make someone successful. Great read for someone who enjoys self help books. You'll enjoy the side stories.,1
Interesting. I liked some of the insights and suggestions to deal with the revelations exposed in the book. It was eye opening and enjoyable.,1
"Excellent Book on Developing Skills. This book is filled with examples and data that are convincing to support the hours one needs to experience and invest to develop a particular skill to the professional level. The book cites successful and creative individuals. It opens the eyes on what is required to be an ""expert"" and serve a community or society. Excellent book.",1

"Interesting. Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful. Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc. I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read. I'd recommend it.",1
"Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes. This book is full of interesting stuff: From why one rural community in the US had amazing health to how plane crashes happen. It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance. (Try also reading Mindset by Carol Dweck.)",1
"good quick, informative, corrective read/listen. good quick, informative, corrective read/listen. recommending for all the pop culture aspiring entrepreneurs after first reading e-myth",1
"Best of his big three works.. If you enjoy having your mind changed, then this is the book for you. I like to think I know how the world works and Malcolm Gladwell likes to show me how narrow-minded I've been.",1
Five Stars. Great book that really challenges yourself and look at problems differently.,1
Well worth the time.. This book far exceeded my expectations - even after having read Blink. Definitely makes you think about the world around in you in a different way. If you have kids you might find yourself frustrated by how we are implementing education and sport selection.,1
"Great Book, exceeded expectations. This book struck my interest based on the recommendation of a peer. The book itself reads smoothly, is well researched with lots of facts and statistics and the anecdotes within are informative and entertaining. The unique stories of Bill Gates, The Beatles and Canadian hockey all stars are all fascinating. I highly recommend picking this book up, it's a quick and informative read.",1
"Transformational. Cutting edge. A must read. That said, this book has been so quoted in the last few years, that it seems positively mainstream. Nevertheless, seminal books have genius in them, and I think that this is one of those.",1
Time for an update. The economy has rolled over .... Time for an update. The economy has rolled over several examples in this book making the theme obsolete.,1
"I'm shocked by all the good reviews. It was aweful.... I ordered this CD set with high hopes after reading all the good reviews. I thought there was no way it could be bad, but lo and behold, I was disappointed and bewildered by the time I got to the end of the last CD. Dumbfounded, really. It is boring, tedious, explains nothing, and gives you an overabundance of details in fields that you probably have no interest in. The main thing is that the author never quite explains the meaning, reason or route to success. The author give you the feeling that there is no rhyme or reason for anything, that it is all chance. The end is very anti-climactic I might add. You learn nothing. What a let down.",0
good. good,1
One of my favorites. One of my go to book gifts. Classic Gladwell.,1
"A different way to view success. The author did a good job of illustrating that no one is a success in life in and of themselves. Success requires a supportive social network from parents to the proverbial lucky breaks - getting into the right schools, being born in the right era or even year, having access to rare resources, etc. The author effecitvely makes the case that success isn't ever due solely to innate ability but a combination of ability, support, timing and opportunities.",1
Worth every penny. Fantastic!! Thanks Flipkart. Truecom Retail known for 100% original books,1
"Wonderful New Way to Think!. Outliers: The Story of Success will completely change the way that you think about hard work and the benefits that come from hard work. Additionally, it was an excellent way to analyze some of the more confusing patterns that have existed throughout history. Malcolm Gladwell does a tremendous job of providing multiple pieces of evidence to support his various claims. As a history teacher, I found the history of the different time periods and cultures to be fascinating, as well as the implications for education and sociological studies.",1
"Must read for all millenials and gen Yers.. This book has really altered the way I see my work and because of it, has dramatically increased my results. Can't recommend more.",1
"Brilliant. As a fan of Malcolm Gladwells 'revisionist history' podcast I decided to give outliers a go, and it didn't disappoint, I can't recommend it highly enough",1
"Three Stars. The more I learn about Gladwell, the less I appreciate and respect his work.",1
"super book!. now that puts success truly in perspective so that we do not get duped by ""I did it alone"" fallacy",1
Five Stars. Great book!,1
"First-rank work by Gladwell again. This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress. Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book. Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.) There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground. Easily one of the most important books of the last 10 years, imho.",1
"Great reading, but not too much new here. I enjoy Gladwell's books - easy to read, entertaining and generally insightful. Outliers fits the bill, although he starts off with a basic assumption - ""We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit."" - that I'm not sure is all that valid. I think most people would agree that circumstance and luck also play a part in creating success, and that's essentially the point he's making in this book. As such, I wasn't blown away by any new insights here - more a validation of what I always believed. Nevertheless, I would still recommend the book.",1
"excelente lectura! un éxito más de Malcolm. Entretenido y lleno de datos interesantes! Un éxito más de Malcolm Gladwell! Explica a detalle las bases, suerte y hechos históricos de varios personajes exitosos!",1
Three Stars. As expected,1
Great book. This is a great book for anyone that interested in weird facts and outcomes of people becoming successful by applying statistics and just dumb luck of being born in the right place at the right time. Very interesting and you can read and come back to it at each chapter without having to re-read or try and remember anything and very simple and easy reading. No complicated psychology…..,1
"Fascinating. I love Malcolm Gladwell’s books bit this is definitely my favorite. This is a fascinating look at success and hat challenges so many, I will call them theories. The questions he asks in order to identify threads to pull and concepts to explore are very interesting. I would never think of the connections he makes or the questions he asks.",1
"Chris G.'s Review. Dear Mr. Gladwell, hroughout the last semester, my high school English class has been reading and discussing ""Outliers"". For every lesson in this class, we try and tie it to our essential question, which is ""to what extent does time and place define a person?"" In ""Outliers"", this idea of time and place is brought up constantly throughout the book, with you constantly brining up the idea that outliers are the way they are due to the opportunities given to them instead of the commonly believed idea that they are outliers due to natural talent. In several instances in the book, people were given advantages in life based off of the time and/or place in which they were born. This was prevalent in the hockey players getting a large advantage if they are born in the beginning of the year, or even that Bill Gates was born during the right time and in the right place to be a pioneer in the computer industry. I really found both of these chapters interesting, as well as chapter 3 which focused on an IQ threshold. The first chapter, The Matthew Effect, was a very interesting concept to me. It was a great chapter to start off the book with because it gave a preface for everything to follow by explaining that hockey players born in the beginning of the year have a large advantage over those born later on. This concept makes a lot of sense, but it is just something that I have never really thought about. The second chapter, the 10,000 Hour Rule, was to me the most interesting chapter in the book. It went against all conventional knowledge that people were skilled at something based off of talent, and instead brought up the idea that they are skilled because of how much experience they have. The idea that you will master a field once you have performed 10,000 in it is also an interesting concept, although I do not know how true it is. Even though there are a few examples of it taking people 10,000 hours to master a subject, I still do not feel that value holds true in all circumstances. For example, I am sure that a lot of professional golfers have spent 10,000 hours on the game, and yet no one has come close to mastering it. Every golfer makes mistakes, and I feel that it will never be mastered. So while I think that the rule is a good general rule, it still does not hold true in every situation. Chapter 3's concept of an IQ threshold was also extremely interesting. Before reading this chapter, I had always thought that a higher intelligence would generally directly correlate to a higher level of success. However, after reading the chapter, I entirely agree with your viewpoint. Once the threshold is reached, social skills and networking are necessary to succeed. I have noticed that some people are able to make up for a lack of intelligence with their social skill. Even though someone has not reached the threshold, I believe it is still very possible for them to be more successful than someone who has. A lot of the concepts presented in your book hold true in my experiences with golf. The best players are generally those whose parents also play golf. This gives them an advantage they were born with that generally allows them to develop faster and practice more. This means that someone who is born with less skill but has this advantage can surpass someone with more skill but who lacks this advantage.",1
"Fascinating study of the factors influencing one's success.. Gladwell makes a convincing case that one's date of birth, culture, and sometimes just lucky circumstances influence one's success in life more than intelligence and ambition. His conclusions are interesting and well-documented. The book is well written and is certain fo provoke serious discussion. I do recommend this book.",1
"Good but not great. Tipping Point and Blink were a much better read then this latest effort from Gladwell. Still, I enjoy his incredible research!",1
Great. my son had to have this book for school. Came in perfectly new,1
"It was a great consumer experience. It came in the exact condition as described. You get what you buy. It was a great consumer experience. And if I might add, it was a really good read. It was very thought-provoking, and it truly opened my eyes to see how the influences around you change how you think, live, and succeed in life.",1
Five Stars. Came in quickly and works just as expected,1
"Hated it!. The book is copy. Words are faded at some places, the pages are dirty and the barcode provided at the back of the book does not scan.",0
"Outstanding...my 2nd best book of all time. Outstanding....I bought a kindle edition, bought another kindle edition for my wife but i need a hard copy for my library. My 7 year old needs to read this at some point.",1
"Gladwell always delivers. I love Malcolm Gladwell. his narrations are really good in my opinion find his stories are even better, and I love how he supports everything that he says with studies and research. she is very informative and this book is a mush read, some people should also take every opportunity that they can",1
"Should be on every bookshelf!. Have bought this book several times; give it as gifts, so keep having to replace it on the bookshelf! A great read and a real eye-opener!",1
Fair. It's not really copy,1
"Wonderfully illuminating. Malcolm Gladwell has written a thoroughly researched, concisely written analysis on the defining characterics of extraordinary accomplishment. The implications of his analysis serves as both a clarion call for transformative achievement and a sobering indictment of our conventional definitions of success.",1
"Certainly Makes You Think About Success. You will never look at someone who says they are self made the same way again. I have always been a great believer in fate...but thinking in Outlier terms, there is definitely more at play that simple fate. Factors that are simply out of your control are more determinate than your own decisions and efforts...take nothing away from those as well.",1
Five Stars. Really good book highly recommend it,1
"Simply amazing.. Extremely insightful and humbling read. So thankful I received this book as a gift, it truly is. Lots of acueste information as well.",1
"A Revelation. This book brings overlooked circumstances forward, and teaches a new way to look at success. Amazing!",1
"I'm Surprised This Book Is So Highly Reviewed. This book seems to me like a direct ripoff of the idea of Freakonomics. The only difference is that it's not as interesting. The book is supposed to be about identifying what creates success. The author sets out to prove that most traits of a successful person are not of their own doing but of cultural or lucky circumstances. The only point that I really like is the 10,000 hour rule which basically states that you can be an expert in something if you practice it for 10,000 hours.",0
Five Stars. What a great read! Really fascinating.,1
Read this!. It explains a lot about success in this world of ours. When you are born makes a huge difference in your life.,1
Socio-cultural advantages of birth time and place. The book explains the advantages that carry the place and time we are born.,1
First M.G book. I enjoyed listening to this book. Drawing on themes that the “self made man” is a collection of generational opportunities is a very interesting concept. Especially when he draws the correlation to his personal family experience.,1
"Interesting dialogue. Interesting information, but no usable information to grow. Seems like there would be some action items to help drive improvements.",1
Surprising insights as usual with Malcom Gladwell. Those who know the writing of Malcom Gladwell and have come to expect his high standard and thought-provoking insights will not be disappointed by Outliers. Those who will be reading Gladwell for the first time should get ready for an intelligent read that will stretch steroetypical thinking about how high achievers reach their potential. Highly recommended!,1
"The Building of exceptional Children. A book every parent of school age children should read. What does equality of opportunity really mean? Knowing how the game is played, and how that will affect your child's success is thought provoking. If you have a child with talents or abilities this book could help you maximize his chances for great success.",1
"Good but not what I was expecting. *Edit* I would recommend listening to the end interview first. It put the book more into a perspective i wish i had during the book. As I said in my comment below that the book is very respectable and brings up very interesting ""Coincidences"" that relate to background and circumstance.",1
"Better than you can imagine. What you are expecting from this book, it won’t give you. You expect to hear about how great people persevered to get where they are. Instead Gladwell shows you how we as a people aren’t responsible for our success alone. This is a must “read” for every person.",1
A good buy.. Well documented and presented analysis of research on outliers.,1
Best Book I've Read in Awhile. Malcolm Gladwell is fast becoming one of my favorite writers. His style of explaining complex concepts through storytelling is both effective and entertaining. I started reading Blink right after I finished outliers it was so good.,1
"Interesting and Inspiring. I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.",1
An easy read. Really enjoyed this book,1
"enlightening. A very interesting take on the impact of advantages, opportunities and hard work in achieving success from a great analyst",1
"Luck or circumstances. Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.",1
"One of Best. I found ""outliers"" One of the best books,if not the best book on the subject of success ever written.Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book as a corrective and an assault on the way we are taught to view and achieve success which does not work and is dangerous.We pretend that success is based on individual merit,when in fact no one does it alone.The notion that if you are not outrageously successful you just didn't work hard enough,or you just don't have what it takes is to simplistic and almost completely inaccurate.Outliers demystifies success and helps one to realize that people who succeed in a big way are more average than you think and more often than not had outrageous opportunities to find meaningful work,and at a time when ones special talents were needed and opportunity wide open to them.like many things it is not one thing it is many things coming together.Read Outliers.the story of success.",1
"everyone with a goal should read this. great read, very inspiring. Can relate and find little things to help you succeed.",1
Good. Good,1
Happy reading. A good read.,1
"Great story about the way the world works. Loved it. Gives perspective about success and failure. How it's not only us, but there are many other factors and it important to remember those and have perspectives in live.",1
"Excellent read. Excellent, easy to read and very insightful",1
"Understanding beyond outliers. Outliers really goes beyond explaining those that excel above everyone else, like Bill Gates and the Beatles. It also explains why some fail, such as pilots and co-pilots following cultural practices rather than safe communication techniques. And, finally it explains how all of us arrive with birth gifts from our past that influence our journey. A great read.",1
The Outliers. Great Book and well written. You can use the book to compare and understand elements that are happening to you and others in the world.,1
"Very engaging! Hooked after the 1st chapter. Does an excellent job of walking through countless examples in modern history of the unique events that fostered the breeding grounds for today's ""outliers"" and argues that intelligence alone isn't enough to guarantee success, but a combination of hard work, opportunity, cultural tradition, and in some cases luck or happenstance is what it takes.",1
Nice. liking it...,1
Great but sometimes ....... The book is beyond great and the research is mind blowing but sometimes it gets overwhelming but still a very nice book,1
"Wonderful. Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",1
Interesting perspective on success.. This was an interesting explanation of the factors which played a pivotal role in producing the world's most successful people.,1
Good book. It is a very good read and thought provoking book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has not a book of nonfiction.,1
Interesting. Interesting but a bit repetetive,1
Great book. Looking forward to listening to more. I love the detail provided to a classic problem on success. It is relaxing to know that while my child may not be best in the world based on our current societal makeup and birthday. He or she can still be good by devoting time and energy and by parents creating opportunities for expert support.,1
audible no good. bought a book and it never played. not looking good at all. at all at,0
Five Stars. An instructive text book!,1
Five Stars. Would highly recommend this book because it really gets you thinking about life and success,1
Five Stars. it was a gift,1
A really interesting read. An insightful book that makes you think. It's not a guide for life but it is interesting as a parent to give you more motivation to look for and use all opportunities that come along in life for your child. It's an easy read - not too heavy but definitely thought-provoking.,1
"Complex interesting. A hard book to follow at times. With the inter weaving of how opportunities determination, luck culture contribute to life",1
"Good read though, I wasn't bored..... Liked this a lot, but then I'm a chronic underachiever so I probably would.",1
"Fascinating. This was so interesting and also well-written and well-read--he could have gone on with many more examples and I would have just kept listening! Particularly interesting to me was the information on intelligence and highly intelligent people. I love the idea that a certain IQ is ""smart enough"" and beyond does not predict increased success. I do know at least one person who is Mensa-certifed who was never able to hold a job or attain any level of success. Also, it is nice to know that good, old-fashioned hard work accounts for most of success that people achieve.",1
Rewire your brain. This will make you rethink your life - and everyone else's. Brilliant.,1
"Fantastic book. I really enjoyed this book. Some of the people here point out that there is no practical advice, so the first 2 times that I checked out the book on here I didn't end up getting it. But I had multiple people tell me to check it out so I finally got it.",1
Surprisingly good!. I was assigned to read this book as part of a leadership program. Some of the books were pretty dry and I started this book with that mindset that it was just another dry read. Once I got into the book I found it to actually be very interesting and kept my attention. After reading it I began to recognize situations and incidences in my own life that were applicable to the book's content. Worth the read.,1
"Makes a person think. Great book. Not your typical book about success, but it does make a person question a lot about our society.",1
Interesting read.... ...but nothing surprising or really groundbreaking. I heard about this from a colleague who would discuss it in hallowed tones leading me to believe this is some deep treasure trove of truth but actually I feel like this is an exercise in force fitting facts to hypothesis. For every person in this book there are dozens that are equally successful that don't fit the theory and even more that should fit the theory but don't have the outcome described.,1
"Truly superb. I finally read it and I find it to be everything everyone has said it is. Totally absorbing, ""Can't put it down"" reading, and staggeringly informative. TEN stars!",1
"Eye-opening patterns. This book was a complete eye opener and not in just one way, but many! The different patterns that made outliers who they are today are remarkable and outstanding all to see that you are an outlier too.",1
Gladwell does it again. Gladwell continues to give us new views into our society and its workings. Great stuff. There is a lot here even if some subject are open to ongoing debate. I do think Gladwell should be a bit more forthcoming in discussing the opposition to his statistical conclusions though.,1
"Excellent transaction. Came very quickly and in the excellent condition specified in the listing. Very satisfied customer. Now I just need time to actually read the book! (Really enjoyed ""Blink"" from the same author, so looking forward to reading this one.)",1
"Interesting comment on old information!. Interesting comment regarding outstanding individuals and the circumstances of there creation . This is not new knowledge , race horse breeders have been using this for many generations of horses. The application of genetic processes to animal groups will often produce the same results. I am amused that a social scientist would believe that this was worthy of note.",1
"This is a fresh perspective on success with some unique .... This is a fresh perspective on success with some unique analyses backed up by real case studies, such as the Beatles, Bill Gates, and Canadian youth hockey players. The notion of paying the 'ten thousand hours' as hard work dues for success, no matter how innately talented the individual is quite interesting.",1
"Five Stars. Excellent information, easy to read and extensive research to illustrate concept presented.",1
"Interesting philosophy. This book wasn't what I originally expected, however by the end it's definitely got my brain juices flowing and looking at the outliers around me. All around a good addition to my library.",1
Five Stars. Amazing!,1
Five Stars. All that it was said to be. Very nice,1
"Outliers. I've read most of Gladwell's books, and this one doesn't disappoint. Have found myself using the insight from this book when reading about or discussing current affairs.",1
It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Words won’t do justice to this book! It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s so informative and easy to read while packing in so much interesting information.,1
"View-changing read!. This book was given as a reading assignment in my college English class. At points it made me angry about my life and what I had been given, through no choice of my own. I kept reading and I finally realized that this book allowed me to understand life as I know it. Gladwell writes to entertain and inform. Not once did I find it dull.",1
"Not Really About Outliers.. This books title leads you to believe that it's going to talk about statistical outliers, but it only nominally does that. Gladwell ignores actual outliers in the teeth of the statistical cases he presents.",0
"Must read for any parent. I know that this is a business book and it does have good business references, but I actually found more value in reading it as the parent of two preschoolers. It causes you to think about the opportunities that you give your kids that will set them up for success. Great read!",1
"In this interesting, well researched book Malcolm Gladwell discuss what the real factors to success are.. In this interesting, well researched book Malcolm Gladwell discuss what the real factors to success are. He debunks the myth of the self-made man who succeeds through hard work and determination alone and uncovers the luck that helped these people out along the way.<br /><br />I liked the way the book is presented. Gladwell takes this information, that some people are predestined to suceed because of their circumstances, and interprets it as there are a lot of other people out there who could also be big successes. If Bill Gates achieved so much because of opportunites he had in high school then how many stories like Bill Gates' would we have if all high school students had his opportunities? By not recognizing the hidden factors to success we are failing to realize, as a society, the full potential of many people. <br /><br />Its an interesting idea and definately makes you wonder about your own life. What has happened that you don't even realize to get you where you are today? What hidden talents do you have that were just never given the opportunity to shine? Unfortunately without Gladwells' extraordinary data analysis skills these are hard questions to answer. Still, if this book makes people even a little more aware of unequal advantages it could be helpful in leveling the playing field.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio, read by Gladwell himself. He does a great job and the book has an easy flow that is pleasant to listen to. The interview with him at the end about how these ideas apply to his personal life is especially interesting.",1
enlightened. this gives new meaning to being in the right place at the right time and timing being everything.,1
"Better the second time. I had read this book years ago closer to when it was published and at the time my takeaway was about hard work and the ten thousand hours rule. Re reading this book now as a DEI consultant and coach, I am amazed at the depths that Gladwell goes to in describing and making the case for privilege, exploring the validity of cultural legacy and the necessity for acknowledging culture. Gladwell's very candid approach to describing society's collective agency on creating a society that allows for more people to succeed is right on time for 2021. Refreshing take. So glad this book found me again",1
"re-evaluative read. gladwell's ""the outliers"" is an insightful and thought-provoking book. it also makes you think twice about the factors of success.",1
"Excellent. The book is easy to understand, explains key points with examples and gets to the point quickly. Very interesting and I look forward to reading more of his work.",1
"Thoughts on Gladwell's Outliers: An exceptional book on exceptions. Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers is an exceptional book about exceptions. The book goes through many different case stories talking about many different types of exceptions -- ie exceptional individuals such as Bill Gates and other early computer pioneers, exceptional events such as plane crashes, exceptional communities such as the town in Pennsylvania with great longevity, and even exceptional populations such as Asians and their achievement in math. It discusses all of these exceptions as not products of innate biological difference between people but as contingent facts to do with how individuals dealt with the opportunities presented to them and how culture shaped this dealing with the opportunity.",1
"A great resource for thinking about your career. One favorite books ever. I keeping using the stories to help students develop their career plans. Good luck is critical, but you have to be ready to take advantage of that luck.",1
"Love it, Love it, Love it. The beauty of a gift. Thanks for being a gift Malcom. The work that was necessary to compile this i would guess is a lot. Thanks for doing it and making it available.",1
"I read this book in two days. Gladwell does an excellent job at. I read this book in two days. Gladwell does an excellent job at breaking down what we commonly believe it means to be success--just being smart, nd tears that apart. Through his convincing research Gladwell states that  culture, circumstance, timing, birth and luck all account for success. e gives the reader a more detailed description of each through a chapter, chapters that really stood out to me. He argues repeatedly that being uccessful isn't just by being a &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot;-- it requires much more than that, and because of that he convinces the reader that with opportunity, luck, and ard work, it's very possible to be successful.  personally got a lot out of the book and it honestly changed how I view people who are successful. I 100% recommend this book.",1
Five Stars. Great Book!,1
Everyone should read this book!. One of the most interesting and thought provoking books I have read.,1
Interesting fast read. The author strings together some very interesting facts and figures that seem to support his theory of what makes people successful.,1
"Loved it!. A great book that suprisingly to me turned out to b great to listen to. I was a little worried knowing that Gladwell typically uses a lot of statistics in his writing, but it held my attention quite well.",1
"Only 3012 hours to go. Malcolm's Outliers is an immersive read that draws you in and spits you out hoping that you are part of some success pattern that you haven't quite recognised yet (and wondering just how many hours you've spent doing that thing you dream of being successful at). The book provides examples of outliers who achieved phenomenal success through luck, circumstance and practical intelligence. It's an illuminating slant on the psychology of success.",1
"Provides interesting perspective on understanding success. Provides interesting perspective on understanding success. Provides information correlating success with a variety of factors: date of birth,immediate social status, social status of ancestry, hard work, ...",1
"Great easy read!. Outliers was a far different look at how to become successful. His examples go into depth about the opportunities that successful people have had. It makes one reflect on - what am I going to spend my 10,000 hours on?",1
"Great Read!. When you read this book you will begin to understand why you are where you are today. It begins at birth - the month you are born in, which can affect your whole life. Talks about the education system greatly - opens your mind up to new ideas and thoughts of which are unknown to human society. Makes you realize that every person does not get a fair start at life. This needs to change and is changing as we speak. WAKE UP people and read this!",1
a great read. So interesting to hear the details of what makes a Bill Gates or a star athlete or a math whiz!,1
Great book. I got this book for my son who is studying to become a doctor and he loved it.,1
"Must read. Amazing! Best book I've read in a long time. ❤ It smashes the idea that success depends on the individual. Culture, team work, and luck all play a role in a person's success or lack there of.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I¿m not sure if I completel. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I completely agree with some of the ideas mentioned. It is about challenging many of the ideas of bias we have about successful people, mainly those considered to be &amp;ldquo;outliers.&amp;rdquo; Many people claim that the only path to success is through hard work, but this book points out that there are a lot of additional factors that contribute to success.",1
"Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell has a very interesting perspective on why and how people have gained their success. He presented many points I hadn't considered. As an educator, I found the last few chapters very interesting. However, I was wondering where he was going with the rice patties. A bit long winded there. Also, I found the aircraft data beyond the necessary information to round out his point.",1
"One of the best books I’ve ever read. I love the research that was done in order to put this together. I’m a huge stat lover, as well as puzzles, and this is a fun book that puts the pieces of “why” together. Fascinating",1
You just can't put it down. It is impossible for me to understand why this fascinating information did not come to light years ago. The writing was on the wall and much of the data was out there. I guess it took Gladwell's inquisitive mind and his arresting writing style to make it real for the rest of us.,1
"I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommend .... I am a student attending University of Baltimore. I was recommended to read this book in my survey Entrepreneurship course. This book discusses opportunities people have been given in order to succeed. Gladwell argues that it is not just innate qualities, talent, or a high IQ that makes someone succeed, but it is cultural heritage, work ethic, support from people, and someone’s attitude that enormously help someone succeed when taking opportunities.  like how the introduction of this book and the last chapter and epilogue all tie the book together to make it cohesive. The introduction of this book was very fascinating to me because it talked about how a group of people living in Roseto, Italy all lived long lives and it wasn’t because of genetics, it was all because of how these people lived and socialized in their culture that made them unique. I never knew something like this could occur. I also liked the ending of the last chapter that suggested more people need to become successful so it won’t just be a small amount of people making it to the top. This inspired me because it made me recognize that someone doesn’t have to say they made it despite their circumstances, but actually made it with the support of their cultural upbringing and circumstances and challenges they faced. One thing I would improve was chapter seven, “The Ethnic Theory of Plane crashes,” by taking out some of the meandering because it was a tad bit of a long and drawn out chapter. his book is useful to other Entrepreneur students because it provides a positive outlook and inspiration for those that may think they don’t have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. Essentially, this book can help someone realize that they don’t have to let their struggles or challenges stop from what they want to achieve.",1
INSIGHTFUL. Fascinating research but not so top-heavy that it's laborious to hear/follow. A perfect balance.,1
Great Read. I really enjoyed this book. It makes you think. Gladwell does a very good job telling stories that make his hypothesis come to light. Well worth the $10 and a quick read.,1
Fascinating study of the various causes of success. Outliers is a fascinating book. The people you are introduced to by Malcolm Gladwell and the remarkable events that create the environments that result in their success or failure are amazing to comprehend. It also helps that outliers is quite well written too.,1
Another great book from Gladwell. A very insightful book and very pleased it's narrated by the man himself - Malcolm Gladwell,1
Great cover. Great.,1
Put in your 1000 hours. At least 1000 hours paved the way for these individuals. Gladwell researches and reveals why our greatest athletes and innovators are successful.,1
"Read it.. This book is amazing and allows you to look at the world from a new perspective. Seriously, just read it!",1
"Leave it to Gladwell to see the patterns others missed. Or did he?. His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",1
My thoughts. Great item,1
Four Stars. Great,1
"Seeing the forest instead of the trees. Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere. The successful have ""hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies"" that are doled out unfairly.",1
"Awesome!! and i should know, I'm an outlier. my son suggested i read this book, I'm glad i did, please read it and the comments at the end",1
but it's good to encourage thinking. interesting,1
The most impactful and incite full book I have read.. Gladwell uses statistics and incite to explain the human exceptional experience. This is the only book I have immediately wanted to re read again.,1
"A great book on real-life outliers. Interesting and thorough analysis of real-life outliers. Gives a different perspective on success, without completely disregarding the common idea of hard work",1
"Amazing book! Gladwell really crystallized principals that some of .... Amazing book! Gladwell really crystallized principals that some of us know inherently to be true, but can't quite put it into words as clear and skillfully as the author. I also learned plenty of new concepts that makes me view every opportunity and set back in life very differently.",1
Great read. Amazing book. Well worth a read.,1
It's okay. I'm a fan of Malcom Gladwell and read Tipping Point and Blink. Blink was definitely my favorite. I h ad some difficulty remaining involved with Outliers. Sometimes it's just where you are when you're reading a book. Judge for yourself.,1
"Fun quick read. This is a very interesting read if you like the author, interesting stories. I know Malcolm Gladwell does not have a lot of fans in the news media.",1
"Extremely inspiring! This book offers an alternative perspective on the requirement for success. 'Outliers' is really a masterpiece. It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",1
My favorite book as of now. A must read. This book makes sense out of everything and lets us know that we can actually Trace back specific moments in time for why we are positioned where we are in the world. this book actually disproves the word outlier outright. That there actually isn't a such thing as an outlier to begin with.,1
"Gets you thinking. This book was amazing. As soon as I started listening, the way I thought about things and the world started to change. I began noticing patterns in things that I hadn't ever noticed before. I highly recommend this book to get your mind thinking out of the box.",1
"Great read. Gladwell laboriously takes us through many great success stories, showing, in fact, success is not a matter of simply how hard you work. Rather success comes when people who work hard take advantage of opportunities, often extraordinary, which are presented to them.",1
"Your success IS down to luck, at least partly. A brilliant book by an incredible storyteller with a profound and powerful message: it’s time to stop the glorification of genius and talent, and recognise success for what it is - a mix of opportunity, culture, luck, commitment and hard work.",1
"Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success.... Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining and insightful analysis into the secrets of success, the value of a commitment to hard work and the edge given to those with a privileged upbringing is worth reading. His ability to interpret statistics within a cultural anthropological framework is a refreshing, agenda free contribution to literature.",1
Five Stars. Girlfriend really enjoyed it.,1
Phenomenal. Will make you see the world more clearly. I recommend it without reservation to people who enjoy thinking.,1
Food for thought. Interesting stories about what makes success (or failure)...and it isn't always what you think.,1
"It really is the story of success.. My best friend recommended this book to me. I found it to be a great book. The information presented will really make you think about the process of success. There is a process to it. Gladwell is telling the ""in-between time"" story of sucess that is often overlooked. I highly recommend this book for educators.",1
"gret book, you learn a lot about the human .... gret book, you learn a lot about the human beings and also about the cultures of the countries around the world i am a trainer and salesman and helped me to understand the reactions of people y deal with.",1
Thank you. Awesome!,1
Great book...essential reading.... Great book...,1
"Think you did it on your own, well, think again. Insightful explanation of the circumstances that shape successful people. If you are inclined to think you did it all on your own, Gladwell will convince you that factors outside of your control played a big, very big part in your success.",1
"Interesting. Had to read this for school, honestly I was not at all excited to read this book. But after starting, overall it’s actually pretty good and interesting, I found I read my way through pretty quickly, it had its slow moments/less interesting but overall a pretty decent book.",1
"Best non-fiction. This is the most entertaining nonfiction book I think I have ever read. It deals with what outside forces cause a person to become successful. Things like year of birth, nationality, supportive community, etc. I highly recommend this book to just about anyone.",1
Five Stars. really interesting.,1
"Another hit. Malcolm does it again. Like his other books, this one is a bit slow, hard to read , and full of data. However it is so informative and interesting you will not be able to put it down.",1
"A Fascinating and Thought Provoking Book. I read this book, because it is on my daughter's summer reading list. Some of those books have been very inspiring. This is is one of them. It's written well enough to read in a few days, but if there's time to stop and think about what the stories mean for our culture.",1
Five Stars. Interesting anecdotes.,1
Good way to kill a couple of days at lake reading book. Was interesting read,1
"Five Stars. Changed the way I think about ""success"" and even changed how I judged myself.",1
"Gladwell does it again!. Once again Malcolm Gladwell has broken through popular perceptions with that rarest of analytic tools, common sense. He demonstrates the ability to carry the reader along with him on his journey of discovery. He shows that the 'how' behind our popular ideas of what makes someone successful, while appealing, are mostly erroneous. However, his common sense approach also shows what is possible for almost any of us to achieve.",1
"Wow.. The evidence has always been right in front of us. Why then, do we love to believe success is only about an individual's gift?",1
"This is officially the best book of 2019. Damn it, this is the most valuable book I've ever read (Maybe I am still in a hangover, can't be sure).",1
"Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatl. If you've ever heard people say, ""You gotta put in 10,000 hours into something before you're an expert."" Chances are they read Outliers. Outliers is about the combination of effort and sheer luck needed to pull out extraordinary success like Bill Gates or The Beatles. The stories and the social science behind them is fascinating and Gladwell's prose makes it an easy, liquid-like read. For people who like to think and want to know how things work, this book is for you.",1
"Outliers: Finally got around to reading it. Gladwell poses some interesting observations on successful people and what contributes to their success. Basically he says practiced skills, environment and timing are the common denominators. Being born in January, I was unlucky not to be Canadian.Read the book to understand why.",1
One of the more interesting books I've ever read. Just finished Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers and it is by far one of the most interesting books I've ever read.,1
"Very happy. Great book, opens your mind and makes you realize things you normally would not think of on your own, puts things into perspective.",1
"A fascinating journey. Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. Outliers definitely does not disappoint. It uses excellent, very specific examples about stories of successful people and organizations throughout history. The section The Three Lessons of Joe Flom has an interesting tie-in to the RJR Nabisco merger and buyout which can be read about in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. Once I started this I couldn't put it down. As always I look forward to reading more books from Mr. Gladwell.",1
Interesting read. Interesting read but a little repetitive,1
awesome read. This book was great! Extensive research obviously went into this. But the the best thing about is the story. Malcolm Gladwell is an awesome story teller!,1
Will last the test of time.. A review of any one chapter of this book will change the way you look at things.,1
"Good entertaining and illuminating read. It’s a short and sweet explainer for our perception of outliers in terms of people’s success and the reality of their background, circumstances and historical context being supremely pivotal to that success, rather than the traditional “self-made” widely perpetuated story.",1
FANTASTIC. The book was very well written and harbored a lot of personal opinions for the author. Because of the personal nature of the book something would have been lost had he not narrated it himself. It was a great book and a great narration by the author! ENJOY!,1
Five Stars. Great read and very thought provoking.,1
Five Stars. Great condition,1
"an educator's look at success factors. This was an amazing research project as to what makes some people successful, however, the section on Korean pilots was too long and not relevant to me as an educator. The most relevant to me was looking at kids' birthdates and how it forced them into academic or athletic experiences they weren't mature enough to handle.",1
Excellent read. Great book. Very thought provoking. It gave me a new way to look at life and success. a must read for every teenager and young adult today.,1
answers many questions. great book that explains many reasons why some people have an unseen advantage over others,1
"Five Stars. Just a book my daughter needed to read, nothing special.",1
"Malcolm Gladwell classic. I love this book. Not only because of how well Malcolm is at narrating his own work, and not because the examples are applicable - I primarily love it because of how well he breaks down the progression path for a lot of people we look up to. Gladwell is master at taking most complex or seemingly straightforward facts and demonstrating a completely new perspective you never thought about. Very thought provoking!",1
"Inspiration for those who appear to be out of step.. Gladwell is always a great read. His ability to take diverse stories and weave them into a form that supports his thesis is wonderful. Good stories, good premise. Thanks Malcolm.",1
GREAT BOOK MUST READ. This book is an amazing read I don't read much but this is an amazing book that give you a new perspective on how the people we see as successful got to where they are and the trues reasoniNguyen behind it worth the buy amazing book highly recommended,1
Five Stars. This is a book that should be required reading in high school. adults should read this as well.,1
Great read. Enjoying the book thus far.,1
WOULD RECOMMEND. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time... I am liking this author a lot. Very well written and easy reading. It opens the readers eyes to a totally different point of view about success and society... WOULD RECOMMEND,1
"Senior English Letter to the Author... cont.. I also found the data employed in this chapter to be misleading. Considering how few people have the IQs you reference, it is essentially impossible to get enough data to make reliable conclusions. Just because factors like emotional intelligence matter should not discount the value of actual or intellectual intelligence. In fact, if IQ is such a crude measurement system (which most people realize), then why use it at all to ""prove"" your theory? The idea that Einstein's level of intelligence was not that important to his success simply disregards reality. Unfortunately, this chapter, with its labored attempts to prove that we all have what it takes - that the smart kids are no better - seems to me like a bit of sophistry that once again makes people feel better about themselves and has undoubtedly resulted in the widespread embrace of this book in our school system that is soft and overly-sensitive when it comes to success and failure. he ideas explained in ""The Matthew Effect"" did seem to hold some water, however, and I could relate. My school district has an enrichment program that tests students to see if they are eligible in the early years of elementary school. Once in the program, you basically do not leave. Not that we are in high school, it is very clear that many of the students in the program do not belong there. At the time we were tested, age certainly made a difference. In fact, for the first several years of the program, I remember that all of the students in it (myself included) were among the oldest in their respective grades. This was probably the best chapter in the book, as you backed up your claims very well. While reading it, I questioned whether I still belong in the enrichment program many times. It was an interesting point to make, and it did give me a bit of a new perspective. espite the aspects of the book I did not like, I do appreciate that you attempt to answer the question of success. Frankly, I feel that it is unanswerable. It certainly is a fascinating topic. incerely, ichael Gildin",0
Full of information on Famous people. I read this in three days while I waited for my wife to get read in the morning. The stories are very succinct and packed with information I would never have even thought about. I never knew anything about Bill Gates other that he started Microsoft with Paul Allen.,1
"I HAVE PROBLEMS NOT FULLY ANSWERED. The description, one chapter after the other, to describe an Outlier as one beyond the ordinary. In fact the stories are about ordinary people who took advantage of circumstances beyond their control. This is something ANYONE can do BY using whatever talents given to us. The point is learn your role and play it to the fullest. Each of us does not need to be an Einstein or a Beethoven 4 stars .",1
"Pick one thing you want to be really good at and put in the 10. It's simple really. Pick one thing you want to be really good at and put in the 10,000 hours to achieve mastery.",1
"Five Stars. Amazing book with lots of insight, read it!",1
"Born January 9th, but not in Canada. So close!. I like this book even though I disagree with the association between rice farming and field farming. That is the only stretch that he makes and the rest is backed by statistical data.",1
"💋💋💋💋💋. Oh my goodness i gave this book 5/5 kisses! It was an awesome book. It talks about how successful people are rarely successful on their own. Their was an advantage somewhere that they usually don’t mention. Even though persistence and hardwork is a major factor, if more people had some of the same opportunities then maybe their would be more successful people. I love how he talks about his advantages and his families advantages at the end of the book. I couldnt put the book down.",1
Excellent Book!. This book is very well written. Gladwell helps one to understand that there is more to success than just hard work and ability; it has a lot to do with being in the right time and place. I teach a History of Psychology class and I have adopted this book as the first to be read by my students. It lays the groundwork for the importance of history and the Zeitgeist of an era. Highly recommended.,1
"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",1
"Thought-provoking. This book reminded me quite a bit of David and Goliath, which is the first Gladwell book I read. Sometimes the conclusions feel oversimplified or even far-fetched, but the book certainly is though-provoking. I enjoyed it especially because the stories made me reflect on my own life, legacy and community so I could more clearly see why I am who I am and where I am going.",1
"Outliers is so good, I got the audio for my husband!. My husband is not a reader, at least not of books, but he will listen to audiobooks on long trips. We both loved it. It is fascinating, and compelling information.",1
"Amazing!. My friend recommended this over a year ago and I just got around to reading it. It was such a great new way to look at how success is perceived in the sporting world, classrooms, and the world. Being a teacher, I thought it gave a great new way to look at how we give students opportunities to work hard and do well. Highly recommend!",1
Great book. very interesting and thought provoking book. a must read for anyone who wonders what really makes people successful. now read it!!,1
"I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if .... Although the author Tries to make you look twice at what you thought were life's predestinations, it does so by choosing very precise close space situations and drawing conclusions from them. I would normally say it is dangerous to draw a universal law of things from such a finite number of observations.",1
"Great read great for teachers, social workers and politicians. Life is not all about bootstraps and hard work. Yes those things are very important but sometimes people need a little help and luck.",1
Five Stars. This is a MUST read. So interesting.,1
"Some interesting ideas but nothing that hasn't been said before. I bought the book because it's GlDwell's bestselling work. I was a bit disappointed. His theories are actually fairly mundane and very often, he is repeating what has already been said before. The book lacks the insight that I was looking for. A mild disappointment.",1
"It's more than just the 10,000 hours. Nice book.. Well written. Interesting subject.",1
"This is not an inspirational story if you are looking for one. Outlier is just a product of luck and effort, but mostly luck according to the author. It feels like it’s depend on your society, community and your early education. Not sure if I like this book or not. But agree that one must work hard and work smart.",1
"Interesting Stories and Ideas. Some really interesting stories and fascinating ideas. Not sure I agree with it all. The author is great and is an excellent writer. I will read more books from this author. The premise is that it is not who you are, but rather where you are in history/time that decides if you will be great. All the robber barons of the American Industrialization were born within a few years of each other. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and more tech geniuses were born a few years apart. I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed. It is probably true, but a little depressing at the same time. What can you spend 10,000 hours on before anyone else? Do that, and you will be the best in your field and quite possibly make a spot for yourself in the history books. A very enjoyable read!",1
one of the best book i have ever read. I really enjoyed this book. It expanded my thinking and the relationship between different events and ideas. It is an easy read. highly recomend.,1
"understanding Success. this book will give you a true understanding, how successful people become truly successful. A better insight on what it means and what it takes for the road to success.",1
One of my recent favorites.. I’ve gifted this book to at least 10 people. I just can’t say enough nice things about the book or Malcolm Gladwell. It’s a joy to have your perceptions realigned this late in life - but not easy. Gladwell does an amazing job of making you reanalyze the way you think.,1
Good. Good product,1
Pretty good. Awesome book,1
"Great Book!. I very much enjoyed the book with the interesting insights and comparisons. Success can be attributed to luck, hard work and opportunities.",1
"If you don't know what success ""is"", you cannot prepare for it. Having read all of Gladwell's popular titles I see the continuation of his endless quest for the answer to ""why"". The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your ""who you know list"" quite limited. Overall, the text makes sense and adds another conversation point for social gatherings or filling time before a meeting.",1
"Not really Malcolm standard. This book reads more like trying to form some pattern within a collection of anectodes. The various stories make this book an interesting read, but somehow the explicit link to outliers is not found in some of them",0
Good read. Good read,1
"Excellent listen. Deep thoughts, good info.. Gladwell delivers complex research and scientific data in a simple (but not over simplified) manner. His insights are invaluable, and the book is a must read for anyone wanting to learn more about success.",1
"Examination. Outliers is an exceptional examination of society as a whole - the narratives and stories we tell ourselves to identify why some in society and others have-not. The simple explanation is totally obvious and not what we would have instinctively thought. Success has nothing to do with talent, it has everything to do with the built-in advantages society, family, community, cultures give that person to make them who they are.",1
"Human connectivity, interrelationships are key to meaningful lives. One of my past pupils recommended that I read this study in June 2018. I picked it up from Amazon and began to read it on a journey to San Antonio, and completed it on the return trip to Berkeley.",1
In-depth view of Why You Are You. Excellent chronology of events and transparency of characters. Malcolm Gladwell takes us to a journey to look at the fabric of ourselves. The beautiful journey took him home.,1
WOW!. An outstanding book - at the top of my list of must-reads for those interested in what makes for successful endeavors.,1
"Some Statistical Anomalies. Interesting premise: to achieve greatness, a person requires the perfect storm of circumstances in addition to perseverance, training, and some innate skill. However, some of Gladwell's statistical analyses are a bit too correlation-heavy--he doesn't do a good enough job accounting for other variables. These oversights, however, do not discount from his overall message. Worth a read.",1
"quick read. Quick read, Interesting perspective on success, enjoyed the examples. Overall great book- looking forward to reading more of Gladwell's books.",1
"Three Stars. I think I had my expectations set much higher ,,,, it's Ok but not earth shattering...",1
Very interesting reading. amazing study of the many variables that lead to success,1
"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",1
"... conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work .... A very interesting read at the start but the conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work ethic, be born at the right time, get the lucky breaks, and be from a middle class to reach the very top in the sport, business or music industries. Well what a surprise!",1
"Will change the way you think about success!. Fascinating! In a delightful story-telling style, Gladwell comments on how history, culture, and hidden factors most of us would never think of have impacted the success of various individuals and groups. Definitely thought-provoking and a very enjoyable read.",1
Good information to know. I don't necessarily agree with success being tied to some of the things he mentioned in this book. The information is good to have but it isn't lifechanging.,1
Interesting. I liked some of the insights and suggestions to deal with the revelations exposed in the book. It was eye opening and enjoyable.,1
"Unexpectedly interesting and thought provoking.. It was a remarkable study about all of the components which make up sucess and/or failure. Timing, luck, intellect, and emotional intelligence all play a part in creating a sucessful person.",1
Excellent book. Always good to be reminded that there's an explanation for everything.,1
"Insightful and engaging. One of few books that i cant stop once i started ! great for parents to be, social policy makers and reflection generally",1
Four Stars. Interesting and thought-provoking - good read and I've used the stuff from this book in my real world.,1
"Limited review. This is a limited review since the book arrived today itself. Going by the ""Tipping Point"" by the same authoe, I hope it lives to its name and hype.",1
"000 hours and become perfect.. Mr gladwell does it again. Such an incredible read. I need to find my niche where I get my 10,000 hours and become perfect.",1
Excellent!. I love this book so excited to read it . Get it super cheap and it’s in better condition than i was expecting! Thanks,1
"Entertaining!. This is a very fun book - informative, interesting, fact-based. It is not fiction, but it is tremendously entertaining and easy to read.",1
Thought provoking book about success. I found myself reflecting on my own ancestors. Feeling grateful for their sacrifices that made it possible for any success that I feel in my life.,1
Five Stars. Best book I've read in a really long time.,1
"I'm left feeling a bit meh.... The author has done his research which speaks to the strengths of this book. At times it was hard to keep abreast of the points the author was making. Just like my review, it could have been condensed.",0
"Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell has once again produced a mind-moving book. If not as applicable as The Tipping Point, it opens your eyes as to how the best (and worst) of society has and still can come about at at time when there need be no outlying any more in the age of connectivity.",1
Should be required reading for all parents. I read a library copy of the book and decided I must have my own copy. This was the reason for my purchase. I am convinced this should be required reading for any person who is or wants to be a parent.,1
Three Stars. First half of book much better that the disappointing second half.,1
Age defiant!. It was recommended to me by a young person. I am over 60. Took a flyer. Cannot recommend this book to much. Have read all of Malcolm books. insight and wisdom.,1
Good quality product. Thank you very much for delived my product and I very happy for that and I just want to say one thing when ever I order something from you're side just send on my exactly house no so that it's very easy for me without any confusion...over all everything is fine onces again thank you very much,1
Pretty good. Good book. Great writer,1
"I highly recommend this book. The book provides incredible insights into the top-tier successes in our society. The information is incredibly insightful and thought provoking. So much so, that after I started reading Outliers, I did not put it down until I had finished it. It gave me a deeper understanding on how some influences in my childhood played a role in who I have grown up to be. I highly recommend this book.",1
Fast paced. Book moves quickly and the short stories used to describe these concepts were interesting and enlightening.,1
My first listen!. Absolutely fabulous! For a First listen I couldn't put my ipod down! Even while I was at work! An absolute great book all around!,1
Great Book. I like this book a lot it was very informative much like most of Malcolm Gladwell's books.,1
"Great read. Love to read Malcolm's work and gain a new perspective on everyday topics. I started with David & Goliath which I loved, and Outliers surely didn't disappoint.",1
Fascinating. I give this book 5 out of 5. It was riveting from start to finish and made me look at this idea of success from a totally different perspective. The stories are emotional and compelling. I want to read it again and again.,1
Five Stars. As great as expected!,1
"I think this is a good book. Makes you focus on doing well and .... I think this is a good book. Makes you focus on doing well and hard work, but also factors in what could be seen as chance good luck.",1
"Good reading but 4 stars for 10k hour rule only. Excellent book, BUT remember the success is when you achieve what you want. Your legacy, genes, sex, gender, size are factors you should consider, but only the sky is the limit and your mind is your first obstacle. I disagree we some considerations from author about circumstantial conditions in advantage outliers have. I know people with nothing in his favor that have achieved success. The most important thing or concept is the 10k hrs rule 4 stars for that.",1
Great idea but terrible writing. The original idea of this book 5/5.,1
"Excellent. This was an excellent book, so good infancy I read it twice in succession.",1
An Interesting Perspective worth understanding. I just have to say Malcolm I love how you weave thoughts and insightful stories into lessons of trying to understand the hows and sometimes whys we humans operate. Wish you could come to Kauai and share more with us here. Wondering with all that’s happening in the world in 2020 what your thoughts are. With your curious mind there must be a book or two in that lovely brain of yours...,1
An entertaining yet insightful read.. A terrific read especially for parents. Gladwell substantiates his theories with both quantitative and anecdotal evidence and uses entertaining examples that anyone can understand to show they play out in the real-world. Now I see what the Gladwell-hype is all about. Will definitely be checking out his other works.,1
Good Read. An engaging read. The author provides some interesting correlations between success and opportunity.,1
"another remarkable audio book from Gladwell. a very insightful read, highly recommended. You may not always agree with his perspectives but it does make you think about common understandings in a new light.",1
"Introspection. Gladwell's theories on success are interesting and definitely sparked some introspection. I enjoyed this work and my book club had a fascintating discussion about it. In fact, this book sparked multiple conversations with friends and relatives. It is definitely intriguing and inspiring.",1
Good Read. Good Read.,1
"Five Stars. All of Gladwell's books are amazing, imformative but very easy to read and comprehend at the same time.",1
"Gladwell provides valid perspective on success-. Through his own narration, Gladwell offers a unique, research based point of view into how opportunity, circumstances, and innate abilities all effect success.",1
Five Stars. a vital read for anyone who doubts their own ability to succeed.....just got to keep on keepin' on,1
Always Enjoy. I always enjoy hearing Malcolm talk through his analysis and justification of patterns in the world. Even better as an audiobook,1
"Excellent!. very superbly written, excellent job on Research, author is also very easy to listen to. highly highly recommended!",1
"This is a great book, very insightful and interesting too. This is a great book, very insightful and interesting too! Looking forward to reading his other books as well.",1
"Thought Provoking. I am an entrepreneur and we're always looking for the ""secret"" - the extra edge. This book goes so much deeper than the drama of the accomplishments of someone successful and looks at the background of what led to their circumstances. Enlightening.",1
"Worth Reading- Very Good Book. Definitely an interesting book, gives the reader a whole new perspective on success and to what extend the external factors contribute to someone's extra ordinary achievements. The book is well written and author made quite comprehensive research on each of the cases and successful people he wrote about.",1
"Great reading and informative. Really enjoyed reading this informative yet down to earth book about achievers. Did not have to agree with every conclusion to both learn and appreciate the author's thoughts. Maybe that was because I have always felt that environment and timing were key attributes of success. Remember one individual who was reverred by many as a guru of entrepreneurism, who, after his first success, had a string of failures in later endeavors. One of the reasons is that his first firm was timed perfectly for the market, while the others weren't.",1
Gladwell disproves that the modern world is a Meritocracy. Totally unique perspective on the causes of success. Gladwell uses anecdotes of some of the most successful people from the last two centuries to argue that success is more deterministic than our American culture assumes. It's powerful conclusions will make you question the viability of a true meritocracy and whether the outrageously rich and successful people of the world are geniuses or just lucky.,1
"Compelling and fascinating. Malcolm Gladwell is a gifted journalist and writer, and Outliers was both a fascinating and compelling look (or rather, assault) on how we view success. He’s got a great voice for podcasts/ audio books, and was enjoyable to listen to him read his book. Couldn’t put down!",1
Book ordered. The book came in perfect condition. As it was a present for a friend I was delighted and would recommend this seller.,1
Very insightful from start to finish.. Never has a book ever become so alive . We can all achieve more if we put in a little bit of effort .,1
"interesting. I enjoyed reading this book but I guess I didn't read the review or summary of the book very well. It really wan't what I expected. It was a good read, but when I was finished, "" I was kind of like, what was the point?"" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case. I didn't find the book inspirational, but at the same time, it kept my attention to the very end.",1
every parent should read this book. This is an amazing book. Explanation on why some children are smarter and some not is a great read and something every parent should be aware of. It will help guard against cultural traits (every culture has some) that could prevent future generation from becoming successful/outliers.,1
"Malcolm does a great job in telling the stories to help you connect .... This is a fascinating book that is a must read for any business person, entrepreneur, athlete, parent, or any person who has an interest in what factors are needed for people to become successful.",1
An interesting and easy listen. The reasons for success are really quite incredible as evidenced by the research that Malcolm Gladwell has done. I chose this book because my sons (in their mid twenties) told me it was great. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. I think listening to this book would probably be easier than reading it because of the statistical information. Not one to read this type of book (prefer fiction and escapism) I expected to be bored but I was intrigued. It was even more interesting that it was read by Malcolm Gladwell himself. I would highly recommend this book.,1
Insightful and thought provoking. A very interesting and fresh set of principles that are likely keys to the differentiated performance of people. Ist may change the month(s) that people plan on having their babies born.,1
"Mind expanding. I won’t give away the story, but you need to read this. I enjoyed this book and the narration of the story was easy to listen to.",1
Opened my mind. This book will give you an entirely new perception on life. I loved it. Thanks Malcolm,1
"It's All About the Opportunities. I have always wondered how extremely successful people have done it. I figured they were just really good at what they do and they worked really hard. Gladwell explains that, yes, they did put in 10,000 hours of hard work, but they also had many opportunities that led them to their success. Bill Gates had the opportunity to spend hours with a computer doing computer programming while he was in eighth grade. He was therefore way ahead of all his peers in the technology department and was able to create Microsoft. It's not that Bill Gates was ridiculously smarter than everybody, he just had more opportunities than them. Gladwell does a great job of explaining that success is not just how one individual worked hard to get where they are. He explains that it matters what year someone was born and where they came from. Outliers, as in the people that are so much more successful than the average person, are not necessarily the smartest ones; they are the ones that had the most opportunities. This is the first book I have read of Gladwell's and I will definitely be reading the others.",1
"Long-winded tunnel vision. I thought the chapter (s?) about air travel would never end! Aside from that, I found too many missing variables as to explain success. The author fails to give credit for individual pioneers, yet ironically gives credit to a collective of group thought. Individuals, particularly religious ones, have historically lost EVERYTHING (family, land, wealth, status, etc) in an attempt to raise the standard across cultures. Many of them have been ostracized or stoned to death by the collective because they like their concubines. They like having slaves. And they love their power. The USA was built on a culture of individualism because it CREATES. It was also built upon the fortitude of individuals who have continually shattered the culture of collectivism. Should they succeed, and be rewarded for their success? YES, because they pave the way for others to live their own individual dreams, and keep building layers, as well. Bill Gates' story is an example of a mentor who fought HARD, you can bet, to obtain or create the equipment Bill learned by. As evidenced by the fact that it wasn't available to the collective, because for the whole, their standard is lower. Individuals reject the bucket of lobsters trying to pull them back down and find a way to climb out. Making a lot of money for their effort is an organic side effect. Idividualism is the crust holding in the apple pie. Without it, we just have applesauce.",0
Good sized book to fit in your luggage or handbag. Not finished this yet (40 per cent through ) but book arrived in gold quality as per Amazon standard. Interesting book about the impact of socio economic factors and luck paved the way for some of the world's most recognisably successful entrepreneurs/athletes.,1
"He has a good thought. Great little read. I wasn't sure I agreed with his thesis at first, but he gradually won me over.",1
"Just Wow!. This experience has been absolutely astounding, thought provoking, and captivating! I recommend the book to anyone and everyone.",1
"Second read. engrossing, cross-referenced, and  wholly persuasive. I have recommended this book, just like it came to me",1
Boring and overrated!. Too boring as a book and audiobook.,0
"Outliers, the story of ""you won't make it"". I found this book a pleasure to read as a great source of history and drawing conclusions to what makes a successful person. Summarizing the traits and upbringing of many successful people in history is indeed an interesting read. However, the book left me somewhat disappointed, almost as if it were trying to say: ""Sorry, you are not from the right country, birth date, race, parental and family background to ever be successful in this age."" After all the reviews and mentions of work partners and public speakers, I expected feeling more liberated rather than marginalized after reading this book. Maybe a re-read in the future might change my perspective.",0
"A must read!. This book is so good! I love Malcolm Gladwell anyway but it's really interesting to read these stories. If you like the podcast Under The Influence (on the CBC), you'll love this book.",1
"fantastic book. This book makes me look at life in a different light, I love how the life experiences were put together.",1
Eye opening. This book does a great job of connecting success with hard work. I love all the examples and logic provided to make the connections.,1
"not sure i was persuaded by some of the stories but nevertheless an interesting and easy read.. Interesting book, not sure i was persuaded by some of the stories but nevertheless an interesting and easy read.",1
good. Good book...,1
Gladwell scores again. I'm always up for Malcolm Gladwell's work. He takes complex global concepts and distills them down into useful ideas to enhance our day-to-day lives.,1
"Great lessons. loved it great new insights, just because you were not born in Jan. there is no substitute for commitment and hard work!!",1
Engaging. It is an engaging book. It illustrates external cumulative causal factors for success. The ideas in the book can be humbling.,1
Opportunity. The gift of opportunity is a most powerful lesson hopefully the individual can see the benefit of the opportunity. Thanks,1
Five Stars. Useful book. A lot of things to learn from this book.,1
Inspiring and Insightful. Simply one of the best books I've read in recent memory. Gladwell makes Outliers an easy yet enjoyable and provocative read. Must buy.,1
"Interesting theory but not totally accurate. I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory. I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.",1
Great read. Interesting facts you never thought of. Great read. Interesting facts you never thought of. First book read by author but will make an effort to read more.,1
very good book. kept me captivated throughout. couldn't wait to see next example in the next chapter. very well researched,1
Amazing. One of the most profound books I have ever read. Excellent!,1
"Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books. This book was a phenomenal read - highly enjoyable, and it really made me think. Possibly my favorite of Gladwell's books.",1
"Good book but information not overly surprising. I liked this book because it gave a different view on success that underplayed the role of genetics. It won't tell you the secret to success but a running theme was hard work and practice practice practice is what makes you an expert and thus, successful according to today's standards. There were also some interesting points about parenting and about the American school system which I'll have to keep in mind if I have kids sometime down the road...",1
"Great book. Highlighted some points about success which we would never hear about or discuss, but are very important. Well written as always from Malcolm, would recommend highly as a book of interest, not so much to learn something helpful for your own life from.",1
One of the best!. Excellent tread! I had not thought of these reasons for success. Gladwells's writing style is enjoyable. Goes to show that timing and practice lead to proficiency in ones endeavors!,1
Five Stars. Nice book,1
What does everyone see in this book?. People are born into it? So only the elite have a shot? Give me a break!,0
Three Stars. A decent enough read,1
Good book. I ordered this book for my English class and it is very good.,1
Very interesting and essential book. I was really lucky to hear about this book and I felt more lucky when I finished it 2 minutes ago.,1
"Success Is Not Luck. This is a great read! Often in a conversation I'll bring up part of this book. I'm looking at success differently now. What would appear to be luck or coincidence is given support as a series of events that lead the individuals within a group to the success detailed. Hockey players, computer ""geniuses"", musicians, business people are all given the deep dive into what allowed them to be at the top of their different fields. The book is broken into chapters that can be read individually similar to a book of short stories. I read this over a long period of time and didn't lose anything by not picking it up daily or weekly.",1
"Very Good Buy!. Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them. Here's a good rule of thumb about Outliers: if you are even vaguely interested in reading this book, you should definitely give it a go!",1
"Very encouraging read. I found this a very encouraging book. First of all it confirms what I tell people all the time about my career - I just work harder than everyone else which is why I tend to do very well. It also explains why others do even better, they had the opportunity of both circumstance and culture. Especially the accounts of Chris Langan and Oppenheimer...I find that my background and culture have delt me some of the same attitudes as Langman, but that it is possible to recognize this and unlearn these traits. Sadly, I see that I have already passed down some of these things to my children!",1
"Great Listen though no practical advice.. Malcolm's books are always thought provoking and out there. I found this one so inspirational, that the second time I listened to it, I made my 14 yr old daughter listen to it. She found it facinating and I heard her talking about parts of it to her friends.",1
Five Stars. great book full of wonderful stories and infos,1
Narrator. No one other than Malcom Gladwell to be the reader of his own book! Truly knows how to eloquently use his voice to keep interest.,1
Outliers allows us to take a deeper look at the ingredients of success. In outliers we are exposed to the various factors that have contributed to the successes of a diverse set of individuals. It highlights the fact that no one is successful solely on the basis of their own work or talent. It exposes the true story behind success.,1
Very interesting. Some great stories of success and the hidden factors behind what makes people extraordinary,1
Why is it rated so high?. This book is just a bunch of stories. There is less than 10% of useful information in it. I couldn't finish it.,0
Wonderful. Good book.,1
just incredible. I was riveted by this book and the amazing stats used to back up the author's claims. It has made me think very differently about my own life and that of my young child's.,1
"Completely facinating. Wow, anyone who teaches or is in business should read this book. It opens your eyes as to demographics and why some people succeed and others fail. For example, the National Hockey League is full of January through March birthdays because the cut off date is typically January 1st for youth leagues. The older kids have a huge advantage, almost a year older when they start playing at 4 or 5. Plus, once they get going at that age, the older kids make higher levels (traveling teams), thus better coaching and more ice time. This applies to school, other sports, and other facets of life.",1
"Success Unveiled!. The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: ""In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",1
cant put it down. The book is well written and interesting. Examples are clear and easy to follow. There's a broad spectrum of analysis across different fields and cultures. Many insights this book offers Ive had a gut feeling about myself and it is nice to read some justification. Everyone should read this book!,1
Five Stars. Very good read,1
Perspective-changing. This book will challenge the way you think about success and about the type of community you raise your children in.,1
"Thoroughly enjoying Outliers. Had to buy the book for a class, but it really is a great story. My class and I are really enjoying it.",1
"Excellent book. I’m not sure what I was expecting to hear when I purchased this book but I am so pleasantly surprised and thrilled with this purchase. The book was so well written, detailed, informative and was had well supported theories. This book has truly changed my life in that it has given me a new way of thinking about success, life, child rearing, family, community, my personal impact on others and the responsibility I have to do and be my very best for the human community at large. This was extraordinary. Very well done!!!",1
"Really makes you think. True to form, Gladwell is provocative, erudite and downright interesting. A great listen. Highly recommended.",1
A must read book !. A must read !,1
Great read. Easy read and enjoyed the subject matter,1
"Motivating, well written, interesting book. I think it is a motivating book. Well written, interesting. I enjoyed reading it. Good examples of the main subjet.",1
Will make you a better parent. This is really interesting data - makes you want to do more as a parent,1
Five Stars. Excellent,1
"A must read. This book should be required reading for leaders of any walk of life, especially anyone thinking they did on their own. ""self-made"" is a misnomer. Everyone has to have along the path of success.",1
An intriguing read. This was a very interesting and thought-provoking book.,1
Life changing!. This book should be read by everyone hoping to make something of themselves. It speaks to the truth that real success is not borne of talent but of opportunities that are properly used. Leaders at any level should read this book and create policies that provide the maximum opportunities.,1
Five Stars. Great book in great quality,1
"Another great one from Gladwell. All of Gladwell's books should be read and this one is no exception. You will learn how the old ""education and hard work"" is not all it takes to become an exceptionally successful person.",1
Five Stars. Great Book!,1
"Excellent perspective view on success achieving. Great analysis of evident cause of success that is clouded by notion of genius in our time. Lots of kids who think they are geniuses may benefit from this book, come down from their cloud based thoughts and start working hard on building their seed of genius into actual success. We'll summed up notion that hard meaningful work pays back for everyone who does it.",1
Five Stars. A great read,1
Great read....important for every entrapenuer. Fascinated at how RICE played such an important role in shaping the Asian work ethic.,1
"more than just ""10,000 hours"". I kept hearing from people that this book promotes the 10K hour theory of",1
FascinAting. Couldn’t put this one down...a fascinating read!!!,1
Definite Buy. Great book. Book came exactly as described in a timely manner.,1
fantastic. Outliers is an eye opening read. It made me think about what has made me successful and hopefully how to help my daughters succeed as well,1
"Wow. A must read for anyone with children. Highly recommended, well written book. Made me stop to think several times - game changer",1
life perspective adjuster. It sounds like hyperbole but it's just a fact that this book had been life altering for me. It actually has helped me define the purpose for the rest of my life: to be a part of a community which provides opportunities.,1
Great work. Great quality of reading and recording. Love this production. Recommend the buy. Thank you audible.,1
"Great insights, but misses the point.. While he points out all of the opportunity Bill Gates had, everyone at his school had the same, but Gates did the work. Same with the Beatles, Joy, and his own mother. Everyone is given opportunities, equal no, and thus outcomes will not be equal. So to say Gates and all those who are outliers are not responsible for their achievements is false. They maybe outliers because of unique opportunities but they are also outliers because of their rugged individualism and hard work. What nation has rugged individualists and hard work as their core? The USA. What nation has forever changed the world for the improvement of all man kind because of the enormous amount of outliers we produce? The USA. So to say it is all luck takes away from those who did the damn work at their own risk.",0
Insightful and interesting!. Malcolm does well in this book. He looks at the conventional wisdom of success and challenges is using well researched historical and current examples. Definitely worth a listen,1
Great!. Not finish reading it yet. But so far so good.,1
"Summary: Success does not happen in a vacuum. If you are under the impression that all successful people have gotten to where they are by their own merits alone, then this book may hold some insights for you. If not, you will find nothing but obvious truths and cherry-picked anecdotes presented as unscientific evidence that all success comes directly from external opportunity with complete downplay of personal efforts. The tracked on interview at the end underscores this unfounded view. The one high note was an interesting examination of the correlation between month of birth and success in professional hockey.",0
"Very Interesting Read. If you like nonfiction with lots of aha moments, this one is a good choice. My son and I took a driving trip, and the non-driver read it to the driver. We spent lots of time talking about the contents. A really good aha read!",1
Fascinating information!. I like the way the author laid out his research that led to his conclusions. I had already loaned my first book so I bought this one for another friend.,1
"Great book. This book shows you how the most amazing aren't really amazing because they were ""special"", rather a unique series of circumstances just happened to be right for amazing individuals to achieve success.",1
Interesting. Great stories reflecting our human psychology/how we behave/interact.,1
Awesome book!. Good reading!,1
"A fun easy read. Gladwell is an excellent writer who is able to combine facts and weave it into a story. I had read several of his books. However, this one was my personal favorite. The only real critical review of this book written by reviewers was that there are no women, I was not bothered by this as a female. It is not an overly intellectual read, more something to read quickly for fun.",1
Garbage. This sucks,0
Must read. Must read,1
"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas.",0
Five Stars. Interesting facts not considered in standard thoughts on an array of subjects.,1
"Well, just as listed, a brand new book.. Brand new book, I don't know what else to say.",1
Five Stars. Wonderful book full of wonderful stories! Once I started it was almost impossible to put the book down!,1
"Fascinating. While some of my book group thought it was a bunch of ""hogwash"", I thought at the very least, it was thought provoking.",1
"Outliers- an insightful perspective in those outside the box. Glad well provides not only insight, but intensive research into understanding outstanding achievement. This text provides lessons for all of us to benefit in our own development.",1
It helped me to look at the world differently. I love it when an author writes in such a way that it helps me see the world from another perspective. This book is a great example of that. It has me reflecting on how I'm raising my own 5 kids and what I can do differently. I'm also looking at how I'm going about my own career and I'm seeing why I've had success and wondering if there were other reasons and if I can create new success,1
Five Stars. Perfect,1
"Great!. The performance was great, surprised that it was the author narrating his book. I've heard too often where this ends up bad.",1
Amazing book. One of the best books I have ever read,1
"borrow the book from a friend. Gladwell knows how to hook interest, unearth some unusual facts and spin a good story. Look somewhere else for original, prize-winning ideas. Nothing new here about the topic of success.",1
very insightful read. Enjoyed listening to this book very much. Couldn't stop listening once I started. I'm already recommending it to friends.,1
"Good Read!. Informative, creative and insightful!",1
Five Stars. Excellent.,1
"Believe it or Not. “No matter how talented you are, how hard you work and how much you practice, you can be successful only if you also have the right backing and luck.” This is a statement I have had heard from elders a thousand times over and this book statistically validates the point.",1
"Why you are the way you are. A facinating story about how various factors beyond any individuals control influence their success. While some of the theories made a great deal of sense, especially those related to athletic success, others, in my mind were somewhat far fetched. The book does make a case for the fact that there really may be no ""self made men"".",1
"Outlook broadening. I fell there is a lot of overanalyzing, but it is a good listen nonetheless.",1
Good Read. The quality was as expected. It suited the purpose for which we bought it. I would happily recommend this product.,1
a great read.. Gladwell really put success into perspective. He looks at the whole picture rather than the cliff notes version. He teaches the value of hardwork and the result of ceasing an opportunity. I really enjoyed this listen.,1
Excellent!. The only thing that kept me from reading it in one sitting was work and family. Extremely insightful and thought-provoking. Please read this book! You won't regret it.,1
"Work, work, work!... On whatever makes you happy.. I agree with the authors point of view regarding success.",1
Five Stars. Inspiring insight into the lives of truly successful people.,1
Great content. Amazing book,1
"Excellent. Brilliant book and a must read for everyone, especially parents. There are excellent learning points around providing your children with the right environment to achieve their potential, creating opportunity etc.",1
A lot of data to say nothing new. I did not like this book mainly because it seems the author collected evidence just to articulate his theory.,1
A must read for anyone under 25 or kids under 25.. I listened to this book and bought the print for my wife. This was one of the best if not the best non-fiction book I ever read.,1
"Excellent read.. Great book, extremely straightforward and easy on the ears. not only does Gladwell write excellent novels his narrorating is perfect for this piece.",1
"Culture can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the ""real"" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",1
"Feel good book for egalitarians. Worried why you or your kids didn't turn out to be outliers like Bill Gates, Sidney Crosby, Shakespeare or Mozart? Fret no more, it's not your fault. It turns out, according to Gladwell's research, that success is 1% talent, 2% hard work and 97% luck. In other words (Spoiler Alert) there are no outliers.",0
"Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration. For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",1
Will We Change Our Ways?. Malcolm Gladwell shows an number of ways we can improve the way we educate. We can easily increase the number of gifted students. Will we? He also shows how to eliminate the education gap between privileged students and under privileged students. Will we? Or will we just sit by and go with the status quo?,1
Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,1
5 star. Read it before. Highly recommend it to anyone. Bought copies for several friends.,1
"Provocative and yet, inspiring stories. This book challenges the idea one have to be gifted to succeed and shows different perspectives of known success stories. There are much more than talent involved on those stories. The environment, the timing, the willingness to thrive with right attitude and hardworking seems to be much more important than the talent. Worth reading, well done Gladwell!",1
Great New Way of Thinking. Great Read.,1
"Ever wondered why Bill Gates is so rich? Or why the Beatles is considered to be a ""once in a millennium"" band? (or why people find ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" to be so trippy, lol) Or simply, why some people are so outrageously successful while others wallow in mediocrity?",1
"Good reading, well written, feels like a novel. It is a well written book, it feels like providing a frugal explanation why it is normal to be ordinary, that you should be blessed by a series of conjunctions and factors to be an outlier, which is fine in some sense, however the good flow of the text brings more joy to this book. So I Recommend it for both reasons!",1
I didn't like the book. I'm an outlier. I didn't like the book. The subjects of the book were privileged and had access to resources I never did as a child of a lower-middle-class family in the 80s. The book didn't make me feel better about having a higher-than-normal IQ. It just made me upset with how the privileged stay privileged and the lack of help/resources for geniuses of financially challenged families.,0
Brilliant listen!. I had purchased the kindle version but got too busy. I bought the audible one and finished it over the daily commute to work.,1
Two Stars. More scientific - like a manual - boring!,0
WOW. Very good one! I haven't ever thought about all these factors affecting our lives. I am thinking about reading it once again!,1
"wow. all time favorite very well-presented very -well articulated, informative and we'll researched. highly recommend it.",1
Excellent book!. It highlights how circumstances can allow for success.,1
"Amazing Book. Just like all of Mr. Gladwell's books, this was another hit. Well written and very inspiring and educational this makes you compare yourself against siblings, friends and co-workers. Just like all of this other books, they provide a thorough look into something that you may have overlooked.",1
Five Stars. Great book and insightful writer!,1
"Expected nothing less. What can I say, Malcolm is a genius and I love all his books.",1
"Helps to understad ""Outliers"". it is a great book, and helps us to build our ability to think about ""Outliers"". Though I read Tipping points by Gladwell, I really think Outlier wins. Malcom had done phenomenal job explaining the events and comparisons. Must read.",1
"Interesting Data. I am a fan of Malcalm, although it has much data and need to take in smaller bites.",1
"Amazing Book. Amazing Book everything was clear, I loved it . highly recommend that anyone or everyone should read it",1
"Who knew? Data applied to our lives. Great tales of the human condition, and how rare and unusual facts contribute to our world and the people who live on this mortal coil.",1
I skimmed this book instead of reading it. I didn’t entirely love it.,1
Best !!!!. Enjoyed every bit of this book,1
"This was the first Malcolm Gladwell book that I have read, and I. This was the first Malcolm Gladwell book that I have read, and I can see why he is so popular. His viewings of why people became successful is not only interesting and brilliant, but it makes you rethink and change your view on success in the world today. What I got out of the book was that the 10,000 hour rule is the key to success. Hard work and dedication day in and day out will pay off, and avenues and situations will open themselves up, allowing a person to seize the opportunity and make a name for his or her self.",1
The Alternative Perspective on Rags to Riches. Incredible way of looking at things. Malcom looks at the information behind successful people. He shows that no man or women is an island.,1
"Fascinating and thought-provoking. It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",1
"Outstanding, love every chapter. Hooked from day one, was not familiar with the author and now I understand why he keeps hitting home runs, every book is a best seller, cannot put it down.",1
"A Book. This was a good purchase. All the words appeared to be securely attached to the paper. None of the pages burst into flames after reading them. The book seemed to rely on the English language throughout the majority of the chapters. The number of pages seemed appropriate to the number of words, without a surplus of either at the end of the book.",1
Outliers. Brilliant topic with a great tie-in with Gladwell's own heritage. Inspires the reader to focus on their own success and spend more time perfecting it.,1
I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising account and very well researched. I like that he looked at things from a completely unique perspective. It certainly gave me some new ideas to think about. Putting a little more effort in studying and learning more about my profession is one of the things that I certainly took from this book. Sometimes all you need is a good book to remind us that we need to step up our game!,1
"Highly Recommended. While some of the conclusions seem a bit overstated, this book will challenge you to THINK.",1
Four Stars. Truly enjoyed it.,1
Eh..... This book was okay for awhile. I got bored with it halfway through. I suppose it's a philosopher type of thing.,0
"Great book. Great book, gives people the knowledge of success",1
"Far from the best book I've ever read, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Long story short:",1
Five Stars. I consider this one the best of the trilogy with blink and tipping point as the other two,1
"Gladwell's Usual Thoroughness. I am always impressed by the thoroughness of Malcolm Gladwell's research and ability to convey that into enjoyable, and insightful reading. This book attempts to convey the story behind the genius that often highlights successful people by breaking the reasons for their success down.",1
Five Stars. Great book!,1
"Outliers. Excellent study on success! If you have ever wondered about why success is easy for some and difficult for others, this read is for you. Very interesting.",1
"Outliers. Not just a book, thought provoking and challenging especially if you have kids! What opportunities are you creating for them and what plays to their advantage naturally due to the factors discussed in the book? There are doubters out there who disagree with some of the concepts which is understandable, that's what the book is meant to do - make you question!",1
"Outstanding Non-Fiction book. This book was recommended to us by one of our doctors. It is a fascinating book about why people succeed and why some people don't. Very informative, great read. die &amp; Sam, N.W., PA",1
Thank you. Awesome!,1
"Great Wisdom. One of the most thought provoking books of our time. Important read for parents, leaders and educators. Success is connected with hard work. Loved the true examples and thought provoking life stories. True life is better than fiction! Must read!",1
"Really enjoyed it but it kind of ended really suddenly and .... Really enjoyed it but it kind of ended really suddenly and then had a lot of notes, critical acclaim, and nonsense...apart from the book was wonderful and insightful",1
super book. great author,1
"interesting, I liked it. this book presents examples of well known success stories with a deeper dive into the circumstances that aligned feeding the inevitable achievements, iconic behaviors that made the best of the best known throughout the modern world.",1
"Great book!. This was really fascinating and I found myself not only thinking about the ideas Mr. Gladwell brought up, but discussing them with others as well. I bought the audio book version to listen to on my drive to and from work and actually found myself looking forward to my commute each day! Great book!",1
Good Book. This book gives you a new perspective on life. I makes you rethink how you define success.,1
"Worth a read. Malcolm Gladwell has a storytelling style that makes for compelling reading, albeit based around 'one big idea', in this instance 'grit'.",1
Four Stars. given as a gift and was well appreciated,1
"an interesting read about how much we truly do need each other. This book made me think about my own roots and filled me with gratitude for their efforts. I have a pioneer heritage of hard working, sacrificing people, who believed in education, education and personal responsibility. My mother taught me to be curious and enjoy the magic in life and my father, the miracles of nature. I am grateful to them and their parents.",1
"New Perspective. This is a totally unusual, yet practical view at some of the aspects that lead to success. I had never thought of outliers from the perspective of the author. Very good read and I got my entire family hooked on it.",1
Five Stars. Great read,1
Five Stars. It's superb,1
The story is very insightful.. I have had the fortune to meet many businesses in exchange for developing and designing websites. Every website project is an opportunity and educational. The Outliers is the answer to what we all want to ask thecowners of the beautiful estates we drive by. In this story we get thectype of onformation pteviously only available to researchets and in a time whete Googling information is in you can think of this book as breath of fresh air.,1
Gives other explanations why some are successful while others are not.. Purchased this book a couple of months ago as a new supervisor. Outliers met my expectations by explaining why some folks are successful while others are not.,1
Amazing book I read for my book club. Amazing book I read for my book club. Great discussion fodder. The chapter on plane crashes had me really fired up. Very provocative.,1
Learning. Gladwell's work is always best served in the audio format and in his own voice. The implications of the various connections and correlations of his research are enlighening as they demystify this thing called success in America.,1
"Persistence. The best thing i loved about this book was the idea of the 10,000 hours. That part made so much sense and I have seen it said over and over again by successful people.",1
"Amazing book. It's my second time reading this book and I'm still amazed at the stories told by Gladwell. What struck me is that after all, it's not those who are successful are outliers but those who not.",1
"Observations On Icons Of Success In History. Book is very entertaining as well as interesting. Has some great history and examples of monumental successes and goes into detail on the circumstances surrounding those successes. Author has some very unique observational view points that are ammusing to say the least. Agree with the authors points or not his books are very thought provoking I think everyone would agree, even those who don't like the book for whatever reason.",1
One Star. This book was sold as new. You can't make this stuff up. See the pictures.,0
"and could easily have been shorter. This book provides an interesting perspective on why some people achieve success while others of simiilar talent do not. It is repeaticous, however, and could easily have been shorter.",1
"Absolute Must Read. I've always rejected the notion of talent. An insult to hard work I thought of it. But Gladwell has illustrated that it's not only hard work, but systemic advantages and downright coincidence coupled with hard work that creates superstars. Gladwell was extremely diligent in his research, backing his points with all sorts of statistics and lively anecdotes. What an amazing read this was!",1
Best Book!. Best book ever!,1
"Food for thought--and discussion. ""Outliers"" reminds me of the best that important writers can do-challenge our pre-conceived notions about life's lessons with well researched, clearly written convincing refutations of the status quo. Whether you agree or disagree with Gladwell's conjectures, this is a great book to discuss with friends; it's perfect for a book club choice. Highly recommended.",1
"If you've read The Tipping Point, buy this!. Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer, explaining the unpredictable and unexpected! His clear writing style makes this a quick read, and gives you lots to think about. A great follow up to the first book. I'm hooked.",1
"Very informative. ""Outliers"" is very informative. In a few chapters I could relate to the experiences of people who I know personally as well as to those of my own. The chapter of 10,000 hours is especially significant because of projects I have undergone myself in which it has taken as much time to be acknowledged by others in proficiency.",1
"Seeing the forest instead of the trees. Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere. The successful have ""hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies"" that are doled out unfairly.",1
Five Stars. All very good and informative books,1
Five Stars. Excellent!,1
"An honest look at success.. I have hope that even this late in the game of life I can forge a path to great success. This book has helped me understand that my background plays a key role in why I feel I have struggled with success as an entrepreneur. I feel inspired to collect data based on my own life, study the patterns, and give myself the chances that were absent from my familial and cultural legacies. Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell, for this meaningful gift.",1
Four Stars. Great book,1
"""Success"" seen in a new light. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, various stories of individuals who achieved success in several different ways are highlighted. In the ""10,000 hours"" chapter, Gladwell expresses the mantra ""practice equals perfect."" If you work, you will achieve success. I, too, believe in this concept. However, one of Gladwell's implications within the chapter is that if one does not start pursuing a talent or goal at a young age, one will not be successful. He also says if an inadequate amount of hours are put into one's pursuit, achieving success will, too, be.unsuccessful. I personally believe if one works hard, and truly wants to attain success, they will. If they start at 30 or do not put 10,000+ hours into their endeavor, it isn't the end of the world. There is still hope and great probability that they will be successful. Another chapter that sparked my interest was ""The Matthew Effect."" In this chapter, Gladwell uses statistics to express one's age greatly affects their success. He does so by analyzing hockey players. The children, who are the older ones in the cut-off, seem to show a greater amount of skill than those who are younger. Yes, this may be a coincidence, but I personally think this is only due to the fact that they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. Here, the older children are given special opportunities. This then accumulates to bring greater success. ""Rice Paddies and Math Tests"" was another chapter that significantly interested me. Gladwell, in this section, explains because of Asians' language and cultural background, they are better at math and work extremely hard overall. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more commonsensical than Western languages. Therefore, Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than those of the American descent. Another argument behind his theory has to do with the significant amount of labor and strength farming rice entailed for Asians. Gladwell says that the Asian culture is overall more hardworking because of the immense amount of work had to be put in to producing rice paddies, and have consequently been shaped by their ancestors to work hard. I do see validity in Gladwell's points, but I can also easily pose arguments that go against what he says. As a student who has been in honors classes all her life, I have seen the broad spectrum of students who enroll in these higher-level classes. Yes, there are Asians present in the majority of these classes, but there are many Whites and Blacks as well. I firmly believe that all students, regardless of ethnicity, have to put in the same amount of work; The Asian culture and background does not give Asian students a predisposition to the importance of endurance and perseverance. When all is said and done though, Outliers was a very interesting read. Some chapters interested me more than others, but the book as a whole forced me to see the concept of ""success,"" as well as its make-up, in a new light. Growing up in the US, we are always told that ""as long as we work hard, we will be successful."" However, Gladwell presents his case for hard work as being not the only determinant of success.",1
A Recommended Read for Teachers. Provides multiple examples for teachers and those who train teachers regarding the unique and critical factors that contribute to success in any era.,1
Couldn't put it down!!!. Every review was accurate with 5 stars for this fascinating and captivating read!,1
"Excellent. Should be read by policy makers. Intriguing readable and fascinating book which shows how luck, fortune and class interplay for creating success . I'm passing this on to so many people",1
Great insight. Definitely worthwhile. The book explores the underlying reasons that some people are able to become great successes. Everything from Bill Gates to the impact of summer vacation on poor students. This is my favorite book of '12.,1
Everyone needs to be aware of this book.. Should be middle school required reading!!,1
Nice. Interesting book,1
"Wow. That's a book that makes you change the way you look at the world, and how you can make your way through it successfully! Bravo",1
Can't review. Amazon is making me review this book before I've even read it! This kindle feature is fascist. Blah blah blah,0
"Easy read; not many actionable takeaways. I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",1
"Looking to get to the next level? Read this book!. The book, ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell teaches readers the fundamentals of recognizing opportunities and taking advantage of them. The many examples provided in the book offers a blueprint in the shaping of one's own destiny. One of the most important tenets of the book was that autonomy, complexity and a connection between effort and reward is the portal through which people become successful.",1
"Its not just you, its your environment.. Malcolm Gladwell generally reviews much psychological reasearh well and presents it accurately, considering environmental factors generally ignored by psychology in general. He even presents at psychology conferences because he is better at teaching psychology than most psychologists. This is his third book and may be the best.",1
"How to make your kid exceptional, lots of right place right time.. This a good read for new and old parents. I read it more like and opinion peace, and it didnt take long to finish, but it does show you areas of life that you can give you child advantages that you may not see without reading this book.",1
"Great Read - Helps Us Realize We Have Much To Learn. This is a great exercise in taking a handful of topics to illustrate how reality varies greatly from common paradigms. It helped me realize that many of the decisions made by individuals and institutions are based on incomplete or faulty perceptions of what is really happening. It is also humbling to recognize that much of success is better explained by chance or circumstance than by the illusion of the ""self made man"". All of this is written in a style easy to read. I've recommended this book to many friends. You might also enjoy ""You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself"" by David McRaney (Oct 27, 2011)",1
"One of the Best Audible Books- makes you think. Wonderful book that made me re-think who I am, how I’m raising my children, and how I perceive others.",1
you can't stop listening 👂. Honestly I could not stop listening I didn't want to pause it and I don't think you'll want to take a break either it's just that interesting,1
"Right Place Right Time?. Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers reads as a provocative new interpretation of the foundations of success. As the reader pages through his numerous examples of seemingly heroic success stories who in fact owe their fortune and fame to circumstance, that reader is tempted to toss aside all previous assumptions about the roots of individual merit.",1
A decent read. pretty interesting study of why some things or people are outliers and his you have to look beyond the obvious.,1
"I was not sure I would enjoy the book - but I have learned to trust .... From its description, I was not sure I would enjoy the book - but I have learned to trust that whatever Malcolm Gladwell writes will be good. He has another home run with this one ... I could hardly put it down. It is chuck full of interesting stories and insights. It has caused me to reevaluate many of the assumptions I have held about what makes for success and failure, and about the overarching influence of culture.",1
Like alana. This is boring.,0
Loved It. I really liked this book. I've of the few that has held my attention. Author did a great job of trying all the stories together. It could have easily felt disjointed.,1
Another Winner!. Another winner for Malcolm Gladwell. A life changer and a small seed of knowledge that continues to impact my everyday world.,1
"Thought Provoking. Love all the incredible stories and details!!! Such a talented human! Awesome, must read book!!",1
"Meh. Couldn't finish this one. The secret to success is to practice and put your work in? Duh. I like some of Gladwell's stuff, but this one didn't do it for me.",0
great history lesson too. Fascinating read from start to finish.......great history lesson too.,1
Stories that resonate. There were several examples in this book that were extremely interesting and offered a fresh perspective but ultimately it seems like the stars aligned and the perfect combination of factors influenced success in many of the big stories.,1
"5 stars = good. On to the next book. I'd take the time to write a well thought out review, but that's what the stars are for. 5 stars = good. On to the next book.",1
"Great intro to Gladwell. Gladwell is brilliant, thoughtful and informative. Just a great perspective. Ready to dig into the next book right away must read",1
Really?. I honestly don’t understand this book has gotten too many good reviews. I simply got this book over somebody’s suggestion and regretted. It really kicked off with a good start and i have to admit it that held it out until part 2. By the end of the jamaican part I completely lost my interest in book. It got me bored when it started overdiggind individual stories.,0
"Work of Genius. Rarely do I find such great storytelling skill in works of nonfiction. I went chapter after chapter excited with Gladwell's perspective on Outliers. Clearly, he must have spent a great deal of time researching for the book, and I daresay the effort has paid off. I recommend this book to everyone with questions on success, especially the young generation that is preparing for the world ahead.",1
"If you want to know the real 'why' behind success .... If you want to know the real 'why' behind success, this is at least an essential piece of the answer.",1
"LESS IS MORE. This book, as other books by this author is long. Not long as in many pages, but long as in goes on & on & on & on on topics that do not need to be dragged out. ""COME ON MAN, I GET THE POINT""",1
"Can Outliers become the new Normal? YES! If we know how to design the right environment to learn, grow, and contribute.. Are outliers normal, only for the very small fortunate few, or can we create outliers as a normal? Mr. Malcolm Gladwell does a fantastic JOB discussing how our environment creates outliers.",1
super interesting. really gets you thinking a different way about success. you can change your whole thought process,1
"Unscientific. I had great hopes of this book, but was very disappointed. The experiments and tests were so open to bias and the conclusions sweeping or not grounded in what had been established by the ""tests"" that the book lost all credibility for me. I give as an example - the experiment involving students' responses at being inconvenienced in their passage along a hallway. The sample is too small in number, too narrow in population selection etc...also the interpretation of responses was entirely subjective and we aren't given the methods & benchmarks for measuring responses etc. I don't remember anything else about the book except feeling irritated by the testing and conclusions. (If something doesn't interest you - you won't remember it!) Maybe I'm hypercritical because I've supervised a number of PhD students etc, but I can think of so many wonderful authors (often unsung) from whom I continue to learn.",0
Glad I read it..... Glad I read it; made me think about the authentic life of those we find difficult to understand; not compelling.,1
Great book!. This book was recommended to me by my manager and I found it to be a great mind opener book that gives you a new angle to success.,1
Five Stars. Another perfect order filled!! Thank you!,1
Two Stars. It was OK. A little slow.,0
Wow. One of the most interesting books I've read about human behavior! It covers culture and timing in the process of unique behavior,1
"stimulating & thought provoking. I really enjoyed the book. I loved all of Malcom's books, I think he's brilliant. I found Malcom's thesis very compelling and his theories struck a chord with me, solid logic.",1
amazing insight!. one of my favorite authors for his interesting insight and perspective. this addresses the opportunity provided to some of the outstanding performers in our society,1
Eye Opener. This book is atypical. What I mean by that is it takes many examples over the course of history and makes the reader question what really defines a successful person. But it’s not a boring history book mind you. It’s written in an intriguing manner and I’m sure anyone who comes to read this book will enjoy it as much as I did.,1
One of the best books ive read. One of the best books ive read. Very enlightening! Explains a lot of what causes some to accompiish so much.,1
"Not great... I prefer his podcasts!. Basic concept repeated over and over again in a few brief chapters - basically your background, ethnicity and when you were born have an effect on your chances of being successfull - mind blown. I love his podcasts but this book is kind of feeble, sorry.",0
"Great book, story and commentary!. Great book that breaks down greatness! You see that Outliers often have put in hours of behind the scenes work.",1
Four Stars. Very good insightful book. Will read again too,1
"great book!. This book tells the ""rest"" of the story when examining individuals that have had phenomenal business and personal success. Great read that clearly demonstrates it takes a village, great timing, some luck and not just hard work.",1
Great book. Great book that shows how people excel,1
"10,000 Hours for the price of a few.. Another way to read this book is, ""it's not me, it's all the people and connections I didn't make.""",1
"A Must Read. Fascinating and thought provoking. More than just a book on what defines success - great for people raising children or anyone curious about human nature, circumstances or cultural motivations.",1
"So much more than just genius and talent. When you were born, to whom you were born, where you were born, how hard you work, how your culture molds your values and behavior. It goes on and on. Gladwell has some intriguing theories that he defends well. He breaks the book up into case studies that ""prove"" various points of his thesis. They are all interesting, but my favorite was the one about his own family history in Jamaica.",1
"Gladwell's Outliers -- what you never even noticed. Gladwell comes up with the most interesting things, and explains in depth the ""how and why"" things connect, happen and/or interact.",1
"interesting. Interesting, as all his writing has been.",1
"Stating the Obvious. Had high expectations about this book given its reviews and mention of how it would change one's life and make you feel clever. Unfortunately, none of that happened. ""Outliers"" should probable be best seen as a collection of anecdotes and observations...some interesting, some bland, many unrelated.",1
"Makes you think. This book certainly makes you think and is enjoyable to read. It can open up a new way of evaluating how we look at successful people and how opportunity and circumstances shape our own lives. While some may argue that the book leaves success up to chance, I believe the author shows that it takes the combination of giftedness, work ethic, and the ability to take advantage of unique and incredible opportunities to be successful.",1
"M. Gladwell. Another good one by M. Gladwell. Well read, clearly stated, good voice and diction. I’m a fan of his books and continue to be one.",1
"In its own segment, highly recommend. Enjoyed this immensely and would encourage you to keep a note pad or notes open on your phone, it will be thought provoking and have you thinking about how you may have an advantage you never thought about.",1
"Professional reading - very good information - applicable to many fields. I like the opportunity to leave comments, but seriously object to a word requirement for comments. Please revise this part of Amazon. ;-)",1
"A new way to think about successful people. seriously a great book, changes the way you look at those who have had great success in today's society and gives new angles to it all.",1
Success is sometimes being in the right place with the right skill set.. well written with a very interesting angle. Enjoyed it.,1
Fun to read.. Great book. Fun to read and very informative.,1
"insightful and well researched!. It is a great read! Insightful and well researched. I like the message - do meaningful work and when an opportunity knocks on the door, be prepared to grab it.",1
Thought provoking. Great read. Great narration.  Very informative and thought provoking. I would recommend this book and look forward to checking out his other works.,1
"Outliers. I think it is an exceptional book, as it reveals aspects about human behavior not commonly known by the average man in the street. The value of ""Outliers"" in my view is that the Thesis of the author is not a fair-fetched one, but something that anyone could apply in daily life, for practical purposes.",1
"Outstanding Book. Of all the many books I have read over a lifetime, this is one of the most interesting. It explains why some very talented people succeed while other equally gifted people do not. I can see the reasons for different levels of success even among my own siblings. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I have also read ""The Tipping Point"" and am now reading ""Blink"" by this same author.",1
Encouraging tool. Excellent life examples that help to make a plan or mision to accomplish a life project. Everybody can make a difference!,1
great read. this book puts a lot of things into perspective. It's a must read before having kids if you want to give them a good head start.,1
"We like to listen to these on road trips.. Anytime we have to drive for a while, I purchase a set of CD's that we can learn from. We have enjoyed this set alot.",1
Loved it. This book was fantastic!,1
"Best recommendation I've had. A colleague recommended this book as an interesting description of what is ""success"". Thoroughly interesting factual examples that contain concepts and notions that can be applied in professional as well as personal situations.",1
Good Read. Valuable lessons: not just as a professional but as a parent. Helps you be alert regarding opportunities that may be right in front of you.,1
"but definitely a good read.. Hasn't made me a success yet, but definitely a good read.",1
"Breathtaking. At the start of the book the writer says he will take you on a journey. And at the end you will have a new way of thinking. This book definitely provides that. Well researched, well structured. One of the best I have ever read!",1
"Highly Recommend. Outliers was very informative and eye-opening. Gladwell certainly did his research. While the information was very enlightening I didn't feel like he spent enough time on practical application. How does this information apply to me? What steps do I need to take to replicate the ingredients for success? The answers to these questions go mainly unanswered. With that being said, I highly recommend the book! It is excellent information and with a little work I think we can come up with some great applications to propel ourselves toward greatness!",1
eye-opener. This book changes the way I look at success.,1
Love the book. Love the book! Malcom Gladwell is a terrific writer and always leaves you with something to think about. I highly recommend all of his books.,1
"My favorite book. for Malcolm Gladwell so far and I have 3 more to go in the series! This book will open your eyes on many of the details we don't pay attention to on how the word ""outliers"" can be misrepresented.",1
"that allowed me to enjoy it so much. I didn't exactly have any expectation, aside from the fact it's popular, when I picked it up and, probably, that allowed me to enjoy it so much. However, I have seen various arguments made in the book elsewhere before I read the book. Nonetheless, Malcolm did a far better job than the other sources through his qualified delivery and interesting real world examples.",1
Eye Opener. This book really opened my eyes to how success is really had by the lucky few. Well written and easy to understand. Anyone can read this and come away with a new understanding of the world we live in. This book needs to be read by all so that we may change the way we encourage and discourage success. I am enriched by reading this book and look forward to reading more by Gladwell.,1
One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people. One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people,1
No one is a special snowflake - it's all down to science and circumstance. What you realize after reading the book: individual success is fake - oftentimes it is the result of multiple factors contributing to a single outcome.,1
Enjoying the book.. Its an interesting read. And I have enjoyed the authors concept.,1
"Very Good. Amazing look into what it takes to be successful. Malcolm Gladwell takes you on a fascinating journey into the makings of some of the greatest minds, and bodies in history.",1
"10,000 hours. Great read. Learning about the 10,000 hours is very important.",1
"you just can't go wrong with Malcolm Gladwell.... I usually dont read more than one book from the same author (for this type of books) because i find that very often after a big hit, they tend to just repeat and try to squeeze whatever was great about that big hit the had but it is definitely not the case with MG. Yea, the style might be pretty similar which would be expected but the topics and his research just doesnt stop surprising me... Blink, david and goliath, outliers, all great books... I might go for the tipping point some time in the future..",1
Five Stars. Excellent,1
One Star. I'm finding this book tedious.,0
Nice book. Really good reading,1
the outliers. the first half of the book is great. then the science falls apart. and the wrighters personal opions begin to take over. ie. the intire last chapter is about his mom. lame... the book Talent is Overrated is much better from begining to end.,1
Entertaining. Loved this book by Malcolm Gladwell. The stories are entertaining and thought provoking; a great listen for your daily commute or a long drive!,1
"... conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work .... A very interesting read at the start but the conclusion in the end was as well as being smart or talented you need to have a good work ethic, be born at the right time, get the lucky breaks, and be from a middle class to reach the very top in the sport, business or music industries. Well what a surprise!",1
"Selecting for Success, One Policy and Culture at a Time. I already was aware that many of the methods by which society selects for ""success"" are biased towards many under-represented groups. I just didn't realize how many groups were under-represented: culture, language and most surprisingly: birthday.",1
"Well written book, with an interesting thesis about the .... Well written book, with an interesting thesis about the success far from the myriad of books that proposed simple explanations or formulas for the success. It's clearly noted the research on several topics conducted by Gladwell to write the book",1
Good service. Product was as described. I am happy with my purchase,1
Would buy this again.. Very interesting concepts. Many good examples to help understand those concepts. These are things you just would not have thought of.,1
"Great perspective.. Such an interesting take on the roots of success, but it's a recipe that everyone knows so well: Hardwork and opportunity.",1
One Star. Horrible.,0
"Outliers - an eye-opening read!. Research referenced in this easy-read provides insight into what might explain the success of many well-known individuals. Historical references and facts abound ... this book provides excellent nurture for table talk, and for the young, much to consider as to what it takes to get ahead in the game of life!",1
"Interesting Read. Well worth the time, changes your perspective on the ""brilliants"" of the world. Would highly recommend to everyone. Five out of five.",1
"Another brilliantly thought provoking read by the masterful Malcolm Gladwell. Amazing! He shines a new light on the ideal of what it is to be successful. By doing so it inspires the reader to take this new perspective and apply it to their own life and opportunities. Malcolm Gladwell never disappoints me as an author, and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this book.",1
"Uncomfortable and unpopular but true perspective of success. Success is viewed from a microscopic level without the hyped up superficial look at success. The penny dropped on why some things are the way they in my own home country. In fact, made me even more bold to determine what the solutions should be.",1
"Enjoyable and enlightening. I enjoyed this book tremendously. It is well written and very thought provoking. Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society. Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion. My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success. The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook. Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely. This is a must read for those in employment hiring and college admissions positions (or similar positions). Heck, the best evidence of the premise of this book is George W. Bush -- does anyone think that he would have been president if not for Daddy Bush and the family and life circumstances he was born into?!",1
Five Stars. fantastic brilliant amazing superb good,1
"good book. starts strong and interesting, gets a bit boring and a bit repetitive towards the end.",1
Good book with lots of information. Lots of information in the book that makes you reflect and understand how timing fits into many things. Also different pieces of history throughout the book.,1
"Read This Carefully For Your Own Good!. So just when I was sure Blink was the most thought provoking book I'd read since Walker Percy's Lost In The Cosmos, along comes Malcolm Gladwell with Outliers. The subtitle, ""The Story of Success"" is a little off-putting because this book is actually MORE than it promises. These aren't just stories of success: the careful reader will find his own pathway to success. Gladwell doesn't promise as much. His publisher probably won't let him. But in my opinion this book is that important. So buy it, and then read it. Carefully.",1
"Groundbreaking. I loved this book. Turned the notion of instant successes on its head and revealed the reality which is that all success is a product of some natural talent, hard work, opportunity, a support system, and timing/luck. Bought his other books after reading this and Tipping Point and I'm sure I'll enjoy them with equal relish.",1
Thought provocing. This book made me think about and reconsider many aspects of how I think about people and judge them based on their appearance or background. There is more to consider!,1
"When opportunity meets hard work. Glad well does a good job of dispelling the myth of a lone success. He more accurately depicts the opportunities that were unique in time and the individuals who recognized and took advantage of what was made available. That is to say, they worked like crazy. A good read that I found very encouraging.",1
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Read with an open mind this book is definitely a life changer. One of the most inspirational and motivational book to date.",1
"A good book to share with the whole family. Being a successful professional, I learned a lot from this book. The author writes well to make serious topics fun to read.",1
"Excellent Book - But needs your involvement.. Outliers, I thought, was a very personal journey for Malcolm, so if you're interested in getting to know the man a little bit, this should give you some insight into his point of view. It's a unique one. Taking the journey with him and opening your mind to the idea that your sheer will, determination and grit might not be enough for your particular set of circumstances is exposing, but thrilling. I give a full review on my website - and I especially mention how I feel the book failed, and where we, as entrepreneurs, need to pick it up and march forward.",1
Novel ideas!. I'm glad I finally got to read this book! Gladwell's ideas are very original and nicely articulated. The book is well structured and supplements each idea with examples and studies. Nice work!,1
This was a journey. A literary masterpiece.........Gladwell is an out of the box thinker that combines his concepts with human sensibility on steroids! I am now a big fan.,1
"Outliers: The Story of Success. A very interesting book with some new concepts that I had never even figured were possible. For example, the concept that anyone is ever, ever an ""overnight success"". Apparently, there is no such thing. Anyone that appears to be an overnight success has already spent at least 10,000 hours learning their craft. This book has forever changed the way I think about success and it's achievement. Most of us may be doomed to mediocrity.",1
Very thought provoking. Really enjoyed the content but I wasn't thrilled with Gladwell's performance of it. Still very much worth the listen.,1
Nice read. It has great anecdotal and practical stories!,1
"Another page turner. Another great book by Malcolm Gladwell. If you like his other books this one will not disappoint. Gladwell explains why some people achieve great success while some other, equally gifted and hardworking people do not. Gladwell posits that success is based on a unique set of circumstances that are outside of the successful person's control and then does a pretty good job of proving his point. While he never dismisses the factors of effort, talent and hard work, he does put these in perspective and the context of unique opportunity. In a very personal and interesting conclusion, Gladwell fits the theory to his own family and his own success.",1
Provided a lot of insight to me. I thought this book provided me with a lot of information about a variety of factors that can affect one's success in life. The book definitely gave me a lot to think about.,1
"Stubborness and consistency win the day.. Gladwell has made his mark in the popular culture media. If I am not too mistaken, he tells us here that success can come out of the unexpected , but laced, with consistent effort. What people label as failure and success needs, he finds, need a new appreciation. I am somewaht discomforted, however, by the idea that much of this is out of conscious control and is merely accidental.I recommen other books of Gladwell for th enjoyment of an active mind at work.",1
Five Stars. Wow...this is an exckent book,1
"How the World Works (Part III). As in ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink,"" Malcolm Gladwell once again helps explain how the world works. Covering a wide range of examples ranging from rice farming in China and Canadian hockey to airplane crashes and the rise of Jewish law firms in New York, Gladwell promotes the thesis that timing and culture are key ingredients to success and that innate talent is less important than most people think.",1
"How the early settlers of the United States of America, from many countries and cultures, became successful and prospered.. Malcolm Gladwell has done it again. Taken documented historical facts and and proven how this great nation was built on individual strength, determination and sacrifice. Commitment to hard work and investing in what you believe in in America. Hooray for distinguishing success through hard work, sacrifice and saving. Setting goals and achieving success. A tool for all ages!",1
"Read this book.. Gives the reader a new slant on success, and sometimes failure. Motivating. Recommend this book to young and old alike.",1
"Great!. Enjoyed it very much...quite factual, entertaining and very interesting. I highly recommend this book.",1
Interesting Read. It was an interesting read but not my favorite my author. Learned some interesting things so worth reading!,1
Four Stars. It is quite an interesting read.,1
"Thought provoking. This was the kind of book that made me sit back and go 'huh'. Malcolm Gladwell discusses the formulas for success. Though this isn't a self help book, it provokes your mind to think about success and the factors that contribute to it. It will open your eyes to what we mistake as 'pure genius'. Excellently written and an author to further explore!",1
A divine book for truly understanding success. This book is inspiring in a truly unique way. It was liberating. A must read.,1
I love Gladwell.. My favorite of all the Gladwell books that I have read.,1
Great product. The book quality is good and the language is also understandable. Been heard of Malcolm Gladwell a lot and been able to bought this in Flipkart.,1
"Another great book by this author. Loved it. Very insightful in how people become successful, and luck has a great deal to do with it. I enjoyed it very much.",1
Great Book. Very engaging and thought provoking. Great story telling by the author. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
Great book. I love this book! I like the way how Malcolm Gladwell think about the world. He help us to see things from a diferent perspective.,1
Highly recommended. Excellent,1
"Repetitive, slow; mixed with some interesting studies. Let me first day there are some very interesting points and portions to this book. However it often dragged - too often reiterating a point far too long. Finally upon reaching the end of Gladwell 's writing, it becomes a bit difficult to identify the writer's true point.",1
Great book!. Uncovers and makes sense of the small occurrences that end up making huge differences in many lives. Read if you want to learn.,1
"eye opening. It's an eye-opening take of what variables lead to success, and makes you question your firmly held beliefs and how successful people make it.",1
Five Stars. Arrived on time and as described,1
good insights about what looks like magical success. I believe in the idea of 10k hours rule and the hardwork that successful people have to do.,1
"Great!. This is a great book. Malcolm reading his own book really brings forth the emotion and the depth of this book. There is much to ponder and a wealth of information. This is not just a book about outliers, this is a book about all of us.",1
Five Stars. Thanks! Exactly as described and fast shipping!,1
"outliers the story of Success. the author is commynicating practice practice practice. What all americans should hear, nothing comes easy even for the very smart or the very gifted.",1
Great book!. It has changed my perception on what outliers are and how did they become outliers. Somehow the book gave hope to people who wants to be successful.,1
"The Hidden Advantages in Life and Culture. Malcom Gladwell’s Outliers is a fascinating book. It synthesizes the coincidental pathways that lead to greatness rather than common place, and does so on the individual level all the way to the national and cultural levels with resulting ramifications. His thesis is not that everybody is bound for greatness, but more greatness could be achieved if the playing fields of education, sports, and culture could be leveled. This does not mean taking access away from achievers, but developing the means for equal access to pathways of greatness for more children/people.",1
Interesting Book. Gladwell causes you to look at several people and professions in a different light. I think it is definitely worth reading.,1
Enjoying now. Great short reads,1
"This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theor. This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theories about what makes a person successful in what they do. It is suggested that much of success is a product of simple (and not so simple) luck. Circumstances and coincidences play a huge role in what makes someone succeed, especially in cases of extraordinary levels of achievement. Another major factor analyzed is practice. It has been found that anyone committing to 10,000 hours (which takes about 10 years out of a lifetime) of practice or dedicated work/study is most likely to excel in that field. While these facts and notions are daunting, it is also promising to think that with enough dedication and time a person might be able to accomplish almost anything. ichael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel &amp;ldquo;To Be Chosen&amp;rdquo;",1
Very interesting book. Excellent Book!,1
Love it!. Very insightful! Malcom Gladwell is a great Narrator. it caused me to think deeper.,1
Fascinating!. Love Gladwell's style. Beautifully written & read by the author. An intriguing argument that he puts forward & supported by numerous examples & research.,1
Outliers: The story of success. I read this book twice before I bought it to pass along to others in my family. I think they were tired of my talking about it so much.,1
Author is the Narrator. I love when the author takes the time to also narrate the book as I experience the reading to be more deep and energetic throughout. 5*,1
"Delightful. Malcolm Gladwell is a masterful, if not quirky, communicator. I thoroughly enjoy his word choices and beautiful thought experiments.",1
"Pretty good considering Cissy isn't a writer. It was raw,honest, open...AND heartfelt. With her all her warts, regrets and memories, this is a story from a Mother who obviously LOVED her daughter with all her heart. It is told from her obvious pov which gives you new insight into the world of entertainment and celebrity.",1
"Bootstrappers. Great narration of how opportunities through policies, economic or social status, or marked periods in time provide insight of success.",1
"Love his writing style for nonfiction. Love his writing style for nonfiction. He gives a broad overview, then tells engaging mini stories, and then hooks it all together at the end. Powerful perspective on what it takes to be successful.",1
"Four Stars. Interesting perspective and I've referenced it often. Really common sense, though. It is the way life works.",1
Three Stars. as expected,1
"If this doesn't shift your paradigm, nothing will.. Amazing, refreshing, enlightening, and entertaining.",1
Wonderful Book. MG is always awesome.,1
"Amazing book! Gladwell really crystallized principals that some of .... Amazing book! Gladwell really crystallized principals that some of us know inherently to be true, but can't quite put it into words as clear and skillfully as the author. I also learned plenty of new concepts that makes me view every opportunity and set back in life very differently.",1
Inspiring book. Very very good read. I just didnt like the quality of the book. Im just fussy lol,1
"Decent Read. I am generally a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, but this was not one of my favorites. Seemed a bit repetitive. Some good insight, but not so many of the ah-ha moments that I am used to from his books.",1
Curiosity did not kill the cat.. this book was amazing!,1
One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people. One of my favourite books ever and a good present for other people,1
Good service. Great book. Good condition and reasonable price.,1
Excelent read. Malcolm Gladwell's book gives insight to outstanding events and individuals. He has researched the background of individuals and groups and has shed light on some of the events that led to their outstanding results.,1
Five Stars. Arrived in great condition,1
... to get another take on his research (not a bad use of time). The theories presented in the book are very interesting and a worthwhile read if you've not read Mr Gladwell's previous works or if you would want to get another take on his research (not a bad use of time). A quite enjoyable read.,1
Five Stars. Great book!,1
Five Stars. Excellent read,1
"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but.... Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",1
It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set .... This book gets you thinking about what we as a society should consider doing differently to encourage everyone to succeed. It is very thought-provoking and helps the lover of knowledge to better understand what success is and how s/he can set themselves and those they care about to succeed.,1
pretty good.. Quick read. Informative. Would recommend it to others. Not sure how to apply it to my life as of yet.,1
Five Stars. 10 stars. This book is a must read and should be read by HS students.,1
Remarkable Teachable Moments. The insight into the evolution of Caribbean social structure and the cultural legacy associated with slavery is clearly illustrated in parts of the story.,1
"Excellent. I enjoyed and appreciated this volume just as much as I did Blink and The Tipping Point. This is a ""must read"" for any bright manager.",1
great read. Great read. Interesting ideas supported with facts. Enjoyed from cover to cover. Great book for anyone who works with kids and athletes.,1
"Outliers: The Story of Success. A very interesting book with some new concepts that I had never even figured were possible. For example, the concept that anyone is ever, ever an ""overnight success"". Apparently, there is no such thing. Anyone that appears to be an overnight success has already spent at least 10,000 hours learning their craft. This book has forever changed the way I think about success and it's achievement. Most of us may be doomed to mediocrity.",1
