It fights cliches of modern fantasy novels and offers up something that is unique but still contains the mystical factor of the genre. The world presented is violent and with a no-one-is-safe policy that leads to some often tense reading. The characters are so wonderfully developed that they could easily be real people, and the different points of view throughout the novel offer unique perspectives on the story's events. This is the first book I’ve read recently, where I could continuously rely on entertainment from it, as throughout my reading, I was genuinely struggling to put it down. 5 Stars.",2019-11-08T00:52:39.000+00:00

Intricate plotting, excellent use of restrained viewpoints, subtle and unyielding character development, and poetic imagery flow throughout the book.

SherryF,4,"Okay. I get it. I know I am late to the party, and now I see why e ...","Okay. I get it. I know I am late to the party, and now I see why everyone is raving about A Game of Thrones. I was confused in the beginning, being fed so much information, but it didn’t take me long to become invested in the characters, fearing for their lives, and wondering who will live and who will die before the first books ends. The more I read, the better it gets. Betrayal is everywhere and I don’t know who to trust either. Revenge runs deep and the punishments are brutal, savage, and bloody. I have chosen those who I think will be special and I look forward to finding out if I am right.

And that ending…Oh man, oh man, oh man…I got A Game of Thrones from my library, and I can hardly wait to get the second book!

Some of my favorite quotes:

“The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,” Ser Jorah told her. “It”s no matter to them if the high lord play their Game of Thrones, so long as they are left in peace.”

He gave a shrug, “They never are.”

“When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or die.”

“…why is it always the innocents who suffer the most, when you high lords play your Game of Thrones?”

“In life, the monsters win…”

I checked the book out from my favorite online library and will be getting the rest through them as well. Can hardly wait to start book II.",2018-05-02T19:49:58.000+00:00

ruthsic,5,"This book was lying on my TBR for so long, and I finally got aroun ...","This book was lying on my TBR for so long, and I finally got around to reading it. Before I start with the review, I'd like to mention that though this is for the ebook version, I mostly read this via audiobook (Whispersync rocks!) and that made the whole journey a bit easier. If you find yourself intimidated by the length of this mammoth, ignore the hour count on the audiobook and get started, because Roy Doytrice is a wonderful narrator. He does some spectacular work in bringing these voices alive, though at times his bass makes it difficult to judge the age of the character. Nevertheless, with the amount of characters in the book and the range of characters he has to portray, he does a commendable job in it.

As for the main story, as this is an epic novel I thought it would be slow-paced. But imagine my surprise when the author pulls you right in this world of dragons and wight walkers, and medieval politics, and a complex religious system. However, even with all the world-building, nowhere did I feel there was a info dump going on, because the world of A Song of Ice and Fire is constructed slowly, character by character, backstory by backstory and myth by myth. It can feel drawn out at times, but since I had the knowledge of the plot from the show, I knew almost every plot arc was leading up to something. It makes for a very involved and complex plotline, one that involves many regions, languages, and belief systems.

A slight problem I had with the book was the overabundance of characters. Especially the endless parade of knights and houses and lords being mentioned, when I had no idea who would be significant. And considering how much plot happens, even if a character is called back later on in a subsequent book, I wouldn't even realize. Another is the misogyny, and subtle racism in the book - for this book only, the lone explicitly POC race (the Dothraki) is depicted as barbaric and monstrous. And no, even if Dany loved Khal Drogo, I cannot condone a character who proudly vows to rape the women of his enemies (amongst all the killing and plundering) in his conquest of the Seven Kingdoms. Granted it is made to be realistically fantasy, it still irks me how sexual violence is often a plot device in books.

Content warning for sexual abuse, violence, coarse language, incest (gods, this is a long list).",2017-05-25T17:26:14.000+00:00

I didn't with this one, and I think that made my experience better. There are so many characters. I think I would have felt and little overwhelmed and lost reading it first. I'm current on the tv show, and I read the prequel book so I have a much better understanding of who people are and what's going on. It's been so long since I saw the first season of GoT that this book was also a great reminder of who the characters were in the beginning. I noticed things that didn't make it into the show and things that didn't register before. I highly enjoyed reading this and can't wait to continue the series.",2016-05-24T00:18:56.000+00:00

Adam_Gentry,3,"Political intrigue can hinge on the smallest of details. 

	Game o ...","Political intrigue can hinge on the smallest of details. 

	Game of Thrones begins as many fantasy novels do, with a hidden threat slowly gathering strength, an ancient enemy long forgotten. What’s unique about this book is how many threats each character faces. The story features 8 distinct perspectives, but as a whole the story centers around three plots. 
	Ned Stark, newly appointed Hand of the King, must journey to the capital to investigate the death of his predecessor, while the rest of his family attempt to navigate the politics of their new position. Jon Snow, Ned’s illegitimate son, leaves to join the honorable Night’s Watch, but finds the reality far less noble. And far away two exiled children dream of somehow reconquering their kingdom.
	In scene everything is filtered through the character, creating a strong sense of narrative in every chapter. The story can be a bit crude and violent at times, but that harshness is more accurate, if less palatable, than most fantasy novels. The book is long and made longer by extensive descriptions, but it is a great example of political intrigue. The trick is knowing who to trust, and how to convince them to trust you. 

+Complex characters

Genre: Action/Adventure   Fictional

This book was absolutely phenomenal. While reading this book I did not know what would happen next. There are so many twists and turns that the author puts into it. It was impossible to lose focus while reading. This book is about many characters set in an age of knights and chivalry. This book takes you on in adventure in their fictional world with new cultures and fantasies. The main idea of the book is to find out and connect the pieces to see who will end up sitting in the royal throne; hense the title. The characters always are growing and changing the way you view and connect with them. The series on tv is incredible but the book makes you feel like you are actually in their world. Personally it is hard for me to stay entertained in a book but unlike any others, game of thrones let my imagination go into the words. The author was able to put so much imagery into the text yet able to keep things in enough order so I was able to follow each step. I highly recommend this book to anyone highschool and up. Do not just watch the shows but also follow them with these books because they will give you so much background information and give you a whole new viewpoint on the land and characters.

The story is set in a mythical medieval land of Westeros and Essos. It follows multiple POVs written in third person limited. Every character is special in their own complex way and they endure in different paths around the mythical world. Now granted, this novel isn't for everyone but it doesn't hurt to at least try.

IAmy,5,Wow. What a ride this book was. A very long 806 page ride. I thi,"Wow. What a ride this book was. A very long 806 page ride. I think I have saddle sores. I was going back and forth about how many stars I wanted to give this book, four or five. In the end I had to give it five. I was obsessed with reading this book. I kept wondering what was going to happen next and it even started influencing my dreams and speech. I remember telling my husband &amp;lsquo;Winter is coming&amp;rsquo; only to receive a blank stare and reminded that it was already here. He knew nothing about the story other than what I have forced him to listen to while riding in the car.




It really surprised me that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. I really hated L.O.T.R. and don&amp;rsquo;t really care for the romance titles that are set in medieval settings, so I just though high fantasy was not going to be for me. I am so glad I went with the recommendations of my book buddies, Jen and Krystal, as they encouraged me to give it a try. Thank you! I might have passed this one up, too intimidated by its length, complexity and genre.




So what did I love about this book? The complexity is what comes to mind first. If you want a story that you can get lost in and has real meat in its pages. This is for you. If you love characters that are rich and infuriating and diverse and strong and weak and honorable and that can be real bastards at time, basically a diverse bunch of players to follow around on an adventure. This is for you. If you want a story where you don&amp;rsquo;t know if good is going to trump evil every time. This is for you. If you want strong women, evil women, timid women, brave women, hell just about any woman besides only a princess waiting to be saved by her hero in a fantasy book. This is for you.




I think that last point is what pleased me the most about this book. The female characters. Sure they needed to play by the rules of the society, but I think Martin did an excellent job of portraying female characters in his book. But all the characters were well written in this book. Some I loved more than others, often they were killed off, and others I so want to take a sword and chop of their heads myself. I can think of four right off-hand that I am looking forward to reading about their demise.




How did I feel about that, the killing off of so many characters? I have mixed feelings, mainly because I read books that are safe. Safe in that you know the heroes are going to ride off into a H.E.A. Martin is not safe if you are easily upset over the loss of a beloved character. I kinda make me respect him though, Martin that is. He is not going to be easy on us, readers, then again life isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Why should books always be? Still I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to read my fluff, cause I do enjoy a happy ending too.




This story is going to be epic. Which is something I haven&amp;rsquo;t read in a while. The closest thing that comes to mind is King&amp;rsquo;s The Dark Tower series, and I so loved that. I love the feeling of we are joining this story at the beginning. We get to witness it all fall apart and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how Martin puts this world back together again.




Did anything not work for me? Not much. There was one point near the end where some drama around the Wall comes to light and I was like really. It&amp;rsquo;s not like you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough going on you are going to add that too. But again isn&amp;rsquo;t that life. We don&amp;rsquo;t get to handle one crisis at a time, often we are overwhelmed by multiple catastrophes at once. Some of the incest was a little gross too. Here again though, I think it is probably true to the world, and even ours as well. I imagine there was a lot of that going on in the royal families of Europe in the medieval ages.




Lastly I also loved the wordplay and language in this story. Martin uses a lot of words to paint his picture, but it is worth it in the end. He has some fantastic imagery in this book and some great lessons for us all. There is much we can learn from the examples the characters portray in this story. Great book, worth the time it took to read it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start the next one tonight cause, like many authors, Martin leaves us with a freaking cliffhanger.",2015-02-05T01:08:16.000+00:00
,5,Worth the Read.,"Its sad that some of you claim that you ""average 40-50 books a year"" but can't comprehend this story. No, the words aren't misspelled. No, there aren't a ton of happy endings. Who wants to be able to predict the ending anyway? So what, there are a lot of characters, more to add to the plot. There are gruesome scenes, this book isn't for children and if you're an adult and comlaining about it, you are a closed minded reader. Perhaps you should be reading Disney stories. I think this series is fantastic, full of plot twists and it has COMPLEXITY that makes and keeps it interesting. Martin is a genious writer. Definitely 5-star-worthy.",2015-02-01T19:18:17.000+00:00

You can see the gravel on the Wall and the rundown castle black at the base of it.  
You can almost feel the cold air in the North and it has an atmosphere almost like a movie.  
It feels like you are another character in the book following along silently.  
I felt emotion as i read farther into the book. 
I was angry when Joffrey executed Ned and i was sad about what happened to Sansa afterwards.  
The best part about the book is that it isnt predictable.  
I thought the Nights Watch would be exactly what Jon wanted and that Ned would save the day and the crown would go to the rightful king.
Instead it takes twists and turns and you don't know exactly what to expect.  
I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in fantasy books or interested in books about drama. 
It has bits of almost every genre that everyone can enjoy a Game of Thrones.",2014-12-08T03:32:07.000+00:00

Granted these books are not for everyone, George writes about subjects that would be seen in actual medieval time or the middle ages but also using classical fantasy tie ins like dragons and magic. You shouldn't compare other authors to each other because that is extremely unfair considering every author has their own way they describe and write things. The way George writes is refreshing with his use of description and his character build up.

I was not disappointed! I'll admit - there are MANY characters and having seen the show beforehand did help me keep everyone in place. But, of course, you get so much more into the story through the book. Things that were skipped or given very little screen time in the show are explained and Martin's story begins to weave together and make sense! Overall a very enjoyable read!

,5,"Often these books are called dark and gritty, a medieval fantasy","Often these books are called dark and gritty, a medieval fantasy put into the real middle ages. There are no bright and shining knights, or noble kings, or gallant princes. The main characters suffer, the innocents have their world views shattered, and the noble die for no good reason. Women are treated as cattle, the peasants are even lower than that, and men are forced to be killers.
But that is not what define these books for me.
Its that through it all, the characters want to hope, they want to live. They fight, and the lose themselves, the suffer the worst horrors imaginable. But they keep going. Because they fear death, they desire vengeance, they have faith in better days. Noble people are killed, innocents are killed, women are raped, families are torn apart, but the living keep going. A brutal killer is changed and reforms because of the kindness of a young girl, a man goes against his king to save an innocent, a woman who is ridiculed because of her massive size and appearance becomes a true knight in her own right.
Yes, these books are dark, there is blood and death and sexual violence, but there is faith in better days. ",2014-06-25T02:41:21.000+00:00

The only thing that bums me out is that....well,  I wish that the dragons played a bigger role. The mother of dragons get distracted by empathy and protecting her people (through marriage) in the short term without investing much time into controlling her dragons. Personal opinion, I guess.

,5,"I've found a lot of the reviews listed on the site as ""most","I've found a lot of the reviews listed on the site as &amp;quot;most helpful&amp;quot; are pretty negative. Personally, I found this book to be an impressive piece of literature. I think a lot of the reviews placed unfair criticism on the novel. I noticed some reviews complaining about the graphic content of the book. There are few scenes with some relatively graphic scenes depicting rape, incest, and murder. You have to remember though that this book was heavily inspired by Medieval Europe, which was an extremely violent time in history. This isn't an innocent, happily ever after story like Lord of the Rings. This book uses a fictional world to paint a realistic picture of a grim time history. This book will captivate you and demand your attention, but it will not uplift you. Other reviews claim that it's a painfully slow read. For an 800 page book, I think it moves pretty quickly. The plot isn't particularly difficult to follow, and nor is there an excess of characters like some reviews. If you find this book a challenging read, you might just be stupid. Speaking of characters though, I found them to be the highlight of the book. They are thoroughly developed and feature lifelike, human personalities. Few are completely good or completely evil. They are all memorable characters, and I really connected with a few of them. The plot of this book is multi-dimensional and unpredictable. It's packed with mystery, adventure, and fantasy. The author has created a lifelike world with its own history, that makes the story that much more interesting. This truly is an imaginative and captivating story. If you enjoy a unique and memorable tale, I promise you will enjoy A Game of Thrones",2014-02-08T19:09:55.000+00:00

,5,Great Read,I'm enjoying the books so far. I have watched the series. The ones calling the aauthor sick for the content crack me up. This is a war. Look back in history it was full of incest and when a colony was taken over many times the women were raped and people taken as slqves. The author is painting a picture of a war not some flowery take over. Great series. The author is amazing painting this picture and having so.many characters with very developed personalities. No in the first book you do.not see the good winning but that two is keeping the reader interested in the next of the series. In the end who will win? At this time we do.not know but itkeeps us pulled in and inttuigued. Who wants to read the samestories written differently all the time?

,2,"I hesitate to mark this book as being read, because I stopped at","I hesitate to mark this book as being read, because I stopped at 56%.  At this point, I had invested a lackluster 16 days of spotty reading.  I just wasn't drawn to it.  I'd rather sit and watch reruns than pick up my Kindle.  

Perhaps it was the fact that the book was too (in)famous.  I knew going in that there would be an abundance of characters and that many of them would be killed.  I had expectations of wonderfulness since the masses found wonder in this book.

For me, I think that the failure came with the frequent character changes.  I couldn't get enough time with any one character to really connect.  Therefore, I didn't care what happened to them.  I didn't even  like any of them.  Combined with a slow storyline, I just didn't want to invest more time when there are so many other stories out there that I really want to read.

A Song of Ice and Fire, b","Superbly Written and Highly Addictive

A Song of Ice and Fire, better known as A Game of Thrones, has been &amp;ldquo;hailed as a classic,&amp;rdquo; despite being less than ten years old. &amp;ldquo;George R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t jump on the bandwagon immediately. In truth, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the books until HBO picked it up as a series. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I discovered it.

Imaginative fiction isn&amp;rsquo;t new and the bar has been set very high in the genre. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s Middle Earth and C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s Narnia were unparalleled until Rowling introduced us to the wizarding world. But in the background, Martin created the fictional world of A Song of Ice and Fire and his world building skills are among the best. The people and places found in A Game of Thrones are exceptional creations and the rules Martin established for guidance are extraordinary.

I feared the multiple viewpoints would be hard to follow. But each thread stitches together a vast and fascinating patchwork story. The characters are diverse, intriguing, and at times their motives are unclear. There are those hungry for power, others who live for honor and still others forced along a path not of their choosing.

I&amp;rsquo;m in it for the long haul now. I&amp;rsquo;m addicted and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get my hands on the second book.",2013-11-21T17:11:46.000+00:00

awmcneal,5,"Is this book series for everyone? NO.  I love romance, history &amp;","Is this book series for everyone? NO.  I love romance, history &amp;amp; sci fi with all the happy endings, hero concures all as much as the next gal and my library is full of that gene.  But sometimes I get bored with that as I always know the ending.  If you want to read a really well written book with real to life plots &amp;amp; twists, than this is the series for you.  Just like in real life the good guys don't always win, sometimes the ones your rooting for die. Sometimes the ones you love to hate die too.  These books are so well written you feel like your in the seven kingdoms.  Like you can see &amp;amp; smell &amp;amp; touch everything he's written on the pages. The HBO series introduced me to this series.  After the second show I was hooked.  So I started reading the books.  I love that the show follows the book so closely and doesn't go off in left field, ie True Blood which I stopped watching after the second year cause it sticks now.
If you don't like the storyline don't read it, but don't give a well written book bad reviews just because it's not all fairytales &amp;amp; hero rescues the damsel type book.",2013-11-16T18:22:33.000+00:00

I have read many books that have kept me reading to the point of pure exhaustion, or even to where I can finish the book in one day (depending on the length). My experience with Game of Thrones, however, was much different. I was consistently impressed with George R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s writing, even if it is slightly graphic and may not suit those with a weak stomach. I personally enjoy that, however, and the diversity and twists that his characters have really kept me reading. I enjoyed that each chapter had its own part about a certain character, because reading about the same character for that long (over 900 pages in my copy) would get tedious. Using a different character in each chapter, but tying each story line together also helps to round out the story and include various aspects for the reader to enjoy. Yes it can be violent, pornographic and demeaning to women, but considering the type of society that Game of Thrones is based in, I think it fits and as long as the reader enjoys a good fantasy story with twists and intensity, it is a great book.",2013-11-09T03:35:58.000+00:00

Nena0,3,"I haven't finished it, but it's not for me.","The characters - I like some, hate some, annoyed by some, and indifferent to the rest.  There are too many plots and the story progresses so slowly.

I'm not for stories where there are so many characters and where I have to read +50 pages of 7-8 different plots just to return to the cliff hanger lack situation of one of the character that I like.  Even then, there still isn't a solution.  The plot doesn't unfold even a little bit it's just a minimal progression of plot.

For me I couldn't read through 7 or 8 other stories to figure out if Bren survived.  I thought - Are you flipping kidding me?  I jumped ahead so I knew what happened to him, and then I returned to my original page.  I just don't have the patience for this type of story telling.  I can tell who is going to live and die so why drag it out.  I'll finish it, but I don't see myself buying the next book in the series.",2013-10-18T23:09:07.000+00:00

The show follows it pretty closely and helped me keep all the characters straight. The author's descriptions of the lands really put you there. The characters are richly written, and you can really get into them. But no one is safe. This is not a ""happily everafter"" fairytale. There are deaths, executions, rapes. Life is down and dirty and real. I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read the next one.",2013-08-14T02:17:56.000+00:00

Nadina85,5,GoT delivers everything you want out of a high fantasy!,"What's so impressive about GoT is the world-building. I don't think I've seen anything this imaginative since Tolkien's LotR trilogy. It's hard to fathom just how much time and creativity and planning went into the construction of this world and series.But as great as the setting may be, the characters are what carry this book. They are all so wonderfully complex and multifaceted, so much so that it's sometimes hard to tell who to root for! Every character is deeply flawed in some way, but it's those flaws that make them so human. The good guys make (often fatal) mistakes and I think that's why their stories resonate so much with us as readers. There is a deep connection to some of these people so you really feel for them during their triumphs and during their tragedies. A Game of Thrones is told via several different characters and there are some people who won't enjoy that, but I'd say with so much going on, it was a necessary device. You get a deeper insight into the story this way and it's also interesting to see events through opposing perspectives. There were definitely some narrators that I preferred over others, namely, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Funny enough, this also correlates to the characters I preferred in the show so that just goes to show you how well they play off one another. And yes, if you're wondering, the show totally does this book justice. You really don't need to read the first book to understand what's going on in the show, however, I recommend that you do anyway. It's too good not to. Also, because the story is so dense, the books help to make sense of the show (and vice versa). The novel clarified things that I was otherwise confused about as well as enriched my understanding of the characters and their motivations. I recommend grabbing the audio version if you can because Roy Dotrice is a champ! Fun fact: he even made the Guinness Book of World Records for doing the most amount of distinctive character voices in one audio production. Reading A Game of Thrones was quite the challenge, and consequently, finishing it was my biggest literary accomplishment this year. Martin has crafted such an intricate and wonderfully detailed  universe full of rich, complex characters and high drama. It has all the elements you could ever want in a high fantasy and rivals the LotR trilogy for best fantasy series EVER!",2013-08-13T00:10:37.000+00:00

Don't you people realize that this type of stuff happened back in the Middle Ages? The author puts rape, incest, murder, etc. In his writing to get emotion from readers. Humans have done and still are doing these very things. He is also being realistic when it comes to how people would actually act if there were 7 different kingdoms to take over. There would be no peace. Betrayel, ruthlessness, evil, greed - there would be plenty of those things. So if you can't handle it, put the book down.

I don't understand who finds this kind of thing entertaining. The author is good at making me dislike characters, but I only kind of like a few of them. Nothing terribly exciting happens until the very end, and even then, I was disappointed. I have a strong stomach so the graphic nature of the novel doesn't bother me too much, but the random descriptions of armor and cloak colors and what people are eating at banquets just bores me. I don't care. I also don't care about what the characters friends are wearing and eating. Thank god I borrowed this book and didn't pay for it.

liv2knit,5,Absolutely fantastic historical fiction.  I enjoy that it is wri,"Absolutely fantastic historical fiction.  I enjoy that it is written from the perspectives of multiple characters, and that the action is so intense.  I once had to put this book aside for a week because I had to recover from my shock &amp;amp; outrage at what happened to one of the characters...now that's some good writing!!  
This series is definitely not for readers who want clearly-defined heroes and villains, as the GoT characters are much too complex for that.  Nor is it for those who want to think that the medieval world was full of honorable lords and knights, fair maidens and well-fed, well-cared for peasants rather than one of ruthless and prevalent violence werein those with power and titles took advantage of their positions (ever hear of Henry VIII?).  Our modern-day ideas of civil rights, equality, justice, even basic human rights were non-existent, and Martin works within those realistic parameters.  
The unexpectedness of events is what I love and hate most about this series.  You cannot hope to predict what's going to happen next, and what does happen may break your heart and leave you re-reading the page just to be sure that that actually just happened.  This, to me, is keeping it real, and makes for some of the most exciting reading ever.
If you can leave your modern-day sensibilities at the door, NOT compare this to any other fantasy series you may have read before, and immerse yourself entirely into the Game, you will thoroughly enjoy this book and the complete series.       ",2013-07-13T16:02:24.000+00:00

Evangheline,5,This is a multi-layered story and each layer is extremely captiv,"This is a multi-layered story and each layer is extremely captivating.  The characters each have their own personality...some you love, some you hate, some you pitty.  There is magic interspersed throughout the story, but more like a background of something lurking in the shadows.  It is realistic in the way that the author makes you relate, love and root for a character, yet doesn't spare the character any pain just because you love him/her.  There is a place in the story called the wall, and there are those who take the 'black' (they are soldiers sworn to protect the realm) and we are given glimpses that there is something beyond that wall that is evil and terrifying and mercyless, yet we never fully know what.  All the while the kingdom within that wall fights among itself a Game of Thrones, where some are so cruel that they would do anything.  There are secrets that the author drives us to read more to find out more.  The descriptions are extraordinary and I would almost compare this book to the world of JRR Tolkien, but perhaps not quite.  The only thing I would warn about is there are explicit scenes of nudity.  Personally I could do without these but I won't take away from my rating of this book simply because the story is beyond amazing and I could overlook these and they add to the story.  Moving on to the next book right away!!!",2013-05-15T03:05:36.000+00:00

Historienne,5,This book is undeniably one of the most impressive and astute hi,"This book is undeniably one of the most impressive and astute historical fiction novels out there. Yes, it is shelved in the Sci Fi/Fantasy Section, it takes place in a made-up world, there are dragons and other supernatural beasties wandering around, and it has fantasy written all over it ... but it is, nonetheless, a story of our world and humanity. Martin has intertwined the fundamentals of society - politics, family values, social mores, economics, warfare, etc. - and thrown in valid examples of human history to create a world which is fantastical, and yet completely realistic and recognizable at the same time. As a history fanatic I LOVE it, and as a human being I am both fascinated and appalled.

The way Martin has set up the story so that each chapter takes place in a different part of the world and is told by a different character has been criticized. It can be difficult to wrench yourself away from a character whose thoughts and impressions have drawn you in to move onto another point-of-view. There were times when I got frustrated because I wanted to keep going with Arya's perspective or enjoy more of Tyrion's impudent one-liners, but the format allowed the story to encompass all of the interested parties, rather than focusing on a single character and the limitations of their knowledge and bias. It keeps the pace swift and forces us to stay on our toes knowing that what our favorite character may think is the truth may well be false due to the limitations of their circumstances, age, gender, outlook, etc. I really enjoyed going from Ned's honorable grimness to Sansa's dreamy naivete, and from Arya's brashness to Jon's lonely quest to find his place in the world. I admit that I wasn't fond of either Catelyn or Daenerys, but their perspectives were vital to the progress of the story.

The world, the characters, the drama and passion of Martin's work is truly astounding. We meet people who would have identified with the Borgias, experience a political and militant atmosphere reminiscent of Medieval and Early-Modern Europe, and fall in or out of love with characters who come right out of the annals of our own world's history. It is a hard story, often brutal, but so rich and eloquently described that the pages practically turn themselves. Bravo!",2013-05-08T14:30:27.000+00:00

Daniel_Martin,5,Great start to long series,"After watching the first two seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO, I decided to venture into the books upon my son't advice.  On the TV series, I found it frustrating to not be able to remember so many characters' names because they're almost all unusual.  It helps tremendously to see them in print.  It all begins to make more sense knowing who is who and what their past and present loyalties are.

I'm almost done with the first book, and the first HBO season was very true to it. I'm told that's not so much the case starting with the second book.  These books are quite long -- over 800 pages -- but the reading is easy and fast, and the author really draws you in.  I would recommend it for anyone who has enjoyed the TV series and has a fair amount of free time on their hands.  Enjoy!",2013-04-28T22:32:24.000+00:00

This is a story for everyone with enough imagination to realize that fantasy is just that, fantasy!
 The idiots who wrote reviews about how bad language and blood and killing ruined it for them need to go back to Disney and their comic books and leave the real stuff for adventurers and people who enjoy escaping to another realm. They call it fantasy for a reason folks. The first book is great and can't wait to read the rest. Yes, I want to kill some of these characters myself, but the is the enjoyment of reading, getting involved! I have learned not to get too attached to any one character, because sooner or later he will die or do something horrible.

I don't think Martin knows where he is going and may never get there if he does.  If you're an older person, like me, don't start this series because you will likely not live long enough to read its final volumes.  The author has now spread his talent to a TV series which will no doubt delay publication of any concluding volumes to the &amp;quot;Fire and Ice&amp;quot; novels.  Having trudged through the first 5 volumes I feel very sad that I won't ever know what happened to Arya and Jon Snow.  The kids were practically the only admirable characters who survived.",2013-03-07T10:23:08.000+00:00

I couldnt get into the 2nd book because all the characters had changed and you cant tell who is good or bad. Its just a crazy ride!! I love books and read alot. This book is not for children. Tthis book could have gone a differant way!!! And the bad guys sometimes win no matter what the reader wants.,2013-03-03T17:23:50.000+00:00
whitepawn,5,Complexity of humanity at its finest.  My only disappointment is,"Complexity of humanity at its finest.  My only disappointment is that Martin is not writing more of these.

It amuses me that the 1stars don't like it because the characters are 'flawed' when that is what makes this series so distinct and 'real' compared to others.  Everyone is grey and dishonorable in some fashion, except Eddard.  That is part of the point.  Jaime is a turd and yet has redeeming qualities that pop up in a later book.  We all love Arya, but...well, let's not spoil it.

If you can't handle complexity, don't read this.  If you can't handle real characters with depth, don't read this.  If you cannot wrap your brain around plots within plots within plots, again, don't read this.

All the people in these pages are both grey and complex, just like the rest of us.  I would like Tyrion to find love, eventually, but that's just me, I certainly won't fault Martin's brilliance any if I don't get what I want on that score.",2013-03-03T02:31:41.000+00:00

Either way I'm really enjoying it so far. I actually watched the first episode of the first season of the HBO show which inspired me to read this book. The show seemed to follow the fairly closely, as close as any movie/TV show ever follows a book, so the first several chapters were a bit of a drag since I knew what was going to happen. Sine then I haven't watched any of the show and I'm only reading the book.

The story is magnificent and once you learn the characters everythimg will start to make sense. This book cannot be compared to lord of the rings they are two completely different things.

,5,Your dumb,For all those people giving this book a bad rating because of the degradation of women... this book is set in medieval times essentially women have no power... for those of you citing the books multiple gruesome scenes of death... its a war its life and most of all its the GAME OF THRONES... the most deadly game of all... all in all i thought this book was absolutely fantastic and although it gets off to a slow start it becomes better andbetter as you go the intricate plot line and sheer amount of characters can make it diffucult to follow at some points but that is what makes it so absolutely amazing the amount of detail the author puts into this book... the fantasy in this book is very different from other fantasy books its teased its hinted at but unlike other books it never fully exposes you to witches and wizards and the like it is all masterfully done,2012-09-17T02:58:55.000+00:00

Characters just die its mind bogling you cant predict whats going to happen like so many other books out there. He keeps you guessing. And all these people freaking out about the rape, murder, and incest, that happen in history during medieval times sorry he isnt sugar coating the book for you, grow up. Sorry its not a book where the good guy always wins and the knight saves the princess sometimes the good guy has to play dirty. Its realistic in all the other books you read the knight is a perfect inside and out thats not believeable. He approaches it from a different perspective and i find them all to be incredible. Read them. Everything gets explained. Just be patient. Its worth it!",2012-08-29T03:49:05.000+00:00

7hir7een,5,I don¿t expect to be able to add any original or innovative thou,"I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be able to add any original or innovative thoughts
about this series when it&amp;rsquo;s already been picked apart and talked about
by so many readers since its release  sixteen years ago.  However, I
just wanted to jot down a few thoughts about the book.  First of all,
despite all the hype and my fondness for fantasy novels thusfar, I
didn&amp;rsquo;t actually pick up the book entirely for the book&amp;rsquo;s sake.  I
decided I should finally watch the HBO show.  But because I&amp;rsquo;m me and
have certain quirks, I  felt compelled to read the book first.  That
wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite what happened.  Thanks to some wonderful wiki contributors,
I found a guide to which episodes corresponded to which chapters online
(the &amp;ldquo;Notes&amp;rdquo; section of the episode guides on the wikia GoT wiki).  So,
I read the chapters for each episode, then watched the episode shortly
afterwards.  This approach really worked for me, and I found myself
enjoying both the book and the show immensely.  This approach helped me
picture some of the areas and characters, and helped me keep everything
straight.  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched the show or read the book but you want
to, you might consider doing the same.  I was glad I did.  Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m
glad the show adhered quite closely to the novel, because I loved the
book.  For me, it definitely lived up to the hype.  George R. R. Martin
has a true talent for world-building and story crafting.  While some
might complain that the novel is too complicated, has too many
characters and intricacies, I was blown away that Martin was able to
craft such a detailed world.  But just because he obviously spent so
much time on the environment, surroundings, and lore doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that
the characters suffered for it.  Quite the opposite, actually.  The
characters were are a real strong point in the novel.  I particularly
like Tyrion and Daenerys, was interested in Arya, Bran and Jon, looked
forward to major events happening with Catelyn and Eddard, was disturbed
by the events in the Eyrie, and loved to hate Cersei and Joffrey.  This
is a strong fantasy novel.  As long as dwarves and elves aren&amp;rsquo;t a
prerequisite for you enjoying a fantasy world, Game of Thrones has
plenty to offer you.  A detailed world, interwoven characters and
events, plenty of intrigue and betrayal.  I expect you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.",2012-08-15T23:16:05.000+00:00

Nilotec,1,Not for everyone...,"One of my friends told me that the Fire &amp; Ice series was fantasy written for people that don't like fantasy when I voiced my displeasure over this book and I couldn't argue that when reading from my own perspective. I love Goodkind, Weeks, Brooks, Feist, Weis/Hickman, Lackey, McCaffery, and many other fantasy/sci-fi authors but when it came to Game of Thrones it was never something that grabbed my attention and held it. 
    Most of the fantasy elements in this first novel are so downplayed it's more like reading historical fiction than the epic fantasy novel I was hoping for. That left me with a political intrigue story played out in a medieval setting. I've read that on occasion and loved Feist/Wurts Daughter of the Empire series. Game of Thrones was similar but without any lasting likable characters and a lack of positive character growth who was there left for me to root for? What was there to keep me going? Since I disliked all the characters there what would keep me caring about if they lived or died?
    All in all I can see how this might appeal to some but for me it was a measure in patience to make it through this first book and left me wishing I hadn't wasted the time in the end. A dry read from start to finish.",2012-07-18T04:18:21.000+00:00

BookwormReflects,4,"A Game of Thrones
A Song of Ice and Fire Book One
By George R. R","A Game of Thrones
A Song of Ice and Fire Book One
By George R. R. Martin

Winter is coming, this is the ominous saying of the Starks of Winterfell when the winter does come back it will bring with it creatures of old tales. Though Winter is on its way this is not the only problem the House of Stark faces when The Hand of the King dies the king himself requests that Eddard Stark become the new Hand and help him rule his kingdom throwing Eddard Stark and his family into a game full of lies, espionage, and murder. Across the sea the former prince barters his own sister for an army of warriors in hopes of gaining his rightful place, but the cruel prince underestimates the people his sister has become a part of. 

There is no way to truly encompass this novel in a short synopsis, not only because it is eight hundred pages long but because the author seems to encompass almost every genre imaginable. I imagine if some authors try this they will find a jumbled mess in their hands but George R. R. Martin managed to bring together a novel that is truly epic and seamless in its telling. Not only does the author write a beautiful story between his characters making you fall in love with each one he also manages to make you hate the villains so much so that you almost wish they would soon get what they deserve. To me this is the mark of a brilliant novel, many authors can make you fall in love with characters but very few can make you hate them.",2012-07-13T16:57:05.000+00:00

Maranna,5,"In a time long forgotten, a event changed the seasons. where sum","In a time long forgotten, a event changed the seasons. where summers last for years and winters forever, and trouble is starting. The cold is returning, and in the land to the north of Winterfell, forces are gathering beyond the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s wall. At the center of all of this, the Starks of Winterfell coming from a land of great cold to a distant summer-like kingdom. this is the story of how many different people who come together in a time of need.

It's just a book that you get really into and fall in love with right away. It's really hard not to fall in love with some of the characters and to hate others.

The broad range of characters that George Martin creates and develops is fantastic.

My only worry is that this series is gonna turn into another Wheel of Time series...where it never ends...and the author dies before he finishes up all hundreds of subplots that he has created.",2012-05-20T17:34:52.000+00:00

I did have a little trouble with the variation on common words (i.e. &amp;quot;Ser&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Sir&amp;quot;), but I figured out after a couple chapters.  The other challenge I had was with some of the descriptive sexual scenes that did seemed to just show up, but did not seem to serve any purpose to the story.

Shirley_Holmes,5,"Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner

First Th","Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner

First Thoughts: I have been wanting to read this series for a while. I have heard wonderful things about it and the show is a huge success on HBO. I have also been craving a good fantasy series that I can devour and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I found this book.

First 50-100 Pages: The first several chapters are amazing. You are introduced to so many characters, houses, families, agendas, and it is a little difficult to keep track of. But as the chapters go on it gets easier. Every character gets their own face in your head and their own personalities.

Characters: Speaking of characters. There are so many good ones and so many that I want to drive a sword through. First, the ones I love: Arya, the spirited child of Eddard Stark who would rather play with swords than dress in skirts; Tyrion, the second son of the Lannister family, a small man with a big personality that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but love; Eddard, the lord of the Winterfell (played by Sean Bean in the show), he is a just and fair man and I fell in love with his loyalty and honesty; Jon, the bastard son of Eddard who joins the Black (members have to leave their family and become family with fellow bearers of the Black) is fiercely loyal to his father and his land; Daenerys, or Dany as she is called, is a Targaryan and pawn of her brothers in order to overthrown King Robert. She is a force to be reckoned with and I feel like she had the most growth throughout the book.

Now for those I didn&amp;rsquo;t like: Cersei, the queen of Robert and a Lannister, she will do anything to get her family on the throne and I really disliked her incestuous relationship with her brother Jamie.;Joffery, Cersei&amp;rsquo;s son and the next in line to the throne. I absolutely hate him. He is cold and heartless; Sansa, Arya&amp;rsquo;s older sister and the daughter of Eddard. She is such an idiot! She could not see through Joffery&amp;rsquo;s coldness until it was too late and she so badly wanted to be a lady that I felt she betrayed her family; Catelyn, the wife of Eddard, is someone who I don&amp;rsquo;t hate, but I do not by any means love. She jumped too conclusions and acted without thought in many cases and essentially was the one who started the war.

The best part of this book by far, is the change in perspectives. Each chapter changes between Eddard, Sansa, Arya, Catelyn, Jon, Dany, Bran,

Plot: There is so much going on in this book, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy. At the beginning, we see mysterious happenings and killings done outside the Wall and the Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch are puzzled. After the prologue, we jump into the Stark family. Within the first few chapters, poor Bran is thrown from a window after uncovering the Lannister&amp;rsquo;s secret. Meanwhile, you have the Stark family trying to remain faithful to King Robert even though is married to the Lannister house. The Lannister house is manipulative and heartless and will do anything to get the throne. Then you have Dany and her brother who are teaming up with the Dothraki, the horse riders, so Viserys, Dany&amp;rsquo;s brother, can be king again. Then, as if human problems weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, there are supernatural beings living in the forest that made an appearance in the prologue still haunting the Wall.

Final Thoughts: Guys. The ending. Holy crap almighty. The last chapter made me squeal and I really want to start the second book soon. This book is wonderful. If you are fantasy fan and haven&amp;rsquo;t read this book, please do. It is truly a great start to what I&amp;rsquo;m sure is an amazing series.",2012-05-03T01:18:49.000+00:00

,5,Ammazing!!!,I love that the author has no problem with killing off main characters! Its a different approach......my only issue is that it lags on my nookcolor and causes it to freeze up. Maybe because it is such a large book?,2012-04-30T08:54:36.000+00:00
,1,This couldn't get any worse!,"I'm only giving this book 1 star because that is the lowest score possible. I'm sorry, but this book is horrible! I've heard so many people rave about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Let me see if I can sum it up: foul language, death, beheading, more foul language, incest, murder in the middle of an orgy, rape of a minor, more foul language, more incest, attempted murder of a child who witnessed incest, loving family torn apart, additional foul language, some boring history about the kingdoms that is pretty much useless info, rape of a minor again, still more foul language, innocent beloved pet killed, lots of animal slaughter, idealic dreams shattered, more murder, and more foul language, all described in graphic and appalling detail. Did I miss anything? Oh yes, more deceit and betrayal than you can wrap your head around. Plus, the style in which is written makes the story, such as it is, beyond confusing. The book jumps from character to character and from storyline to storyline with each chapter and with no continuity whatsoever. You never know who or what you'll be reading about next. That type of writing works when shown on TV or in movies, but not in books. (Hmmm...was someone ambitious and looking towards the future as he wrote? Admittedly, the TV series DOES make more sense, but then you actually have to WATCH everything written above.) There are way too many characters with weird names and places and plot lines to keep straight. And for the love of the gods, why can't this man spell any words like normal?! For example, ""Sir"" is ""Ser"", and ""Master"" is ""Maester"". Misspelled words does not a fantasy novel make! Which, by the way, I'm not seeing much fantasy here. Okay, there are some zombie-like creatures that pop up here and there, and there's a little bit about dragons at the end, but that's it. The direwolves are big and smart, but not enough to really be considered fantasy. There are no wizards, no spells, no non-human races, other fantastical creatures, or anything else you'd associate with fantasy books. I read a lot, averaging 40-50 books a year, almost all fantasy or historical fiction. Typically, I can't put a book down until I'm barely awake, and even then I don't stop until I get to a good stopping point, like the end of a chapter. With this book, I repeatedly found myself reading the same few sentences over and over again because my mind kept wandering to other things, like what errands I needed to run or what I was making for dinner. I never read to exhaustion, but rather would stop in the middle of a sentence and think, ""That's enough. I can't take anymore right now."" Stopping at the end of a chapter or the middle of a sentence was essentially the same thing. You're confused and can't remember anything when you pick it back up anyway. I forced myself to finish the book, and I even forced myself to start the second one. But I got 260 pages into the second one and couldn't take it anymore. I have serious doubts about the mental health of the author, and I absolutely cannot see how anyone could not be sickened by this filth. Do yourself a favor: save your time and money and SKIP this awful series!",2012-04-30T08:33:06.000+00:00
,2,"I've only read part of the book, and am having trouble trying to","I've only read part of the book, and am having trouble trying to decide if I want to keep reading. The book started out somewhat interesting, but as I continued to read, I realized that it might be going nowhere. Some people have praised this series for being different from other fantasy works. But trust me, it's nothing spectacular or avant garde. A Game of Thrones is basically a soap opera. In some ways, it sort of reminded me of The Tudors, only with references to dragons and having large wolves called direwolves. None of the characters are appealing in any way, and the graphic descriptions of rape, pedophilia, and incest detracts from the story, rather than adds to it. In fact, in my humble opinion, the fact that Martin has such atrocities as rape, pedophilia and incest throughout the entire work, make me wander what kind of person he is. He seems kind of sick sometimes, and makes me wander if he has issues with women, which is another thing that annoy me. This book is degrading to women. Any female character you come across ends up involved either in rape, incest, or pedophilia. In this day and age that is asking for respect for women, I'm surprised such a degrading book has become so popular. Not to mention the pedophilia. I'm only in thee middle of the book, and I can't say I recommend. There has to be something better out there, something with drama, not melodrama, something with characters that aren't so despicable, and where female characters don't end up in degrading situations.",2012-04-30T01:31:02.000+00:00

I can underdtand not wanting a favorite character to die, but I think it more realistic for there to be casualties in a book that has war in it. Not everyone survives, but there memory can live on as inspiration. I thought it curious that the chapters were named after people, but this made it a neat way for the author to switch between settings cleanly and keep the audience knowledgeable about where in the seven kingdoms they were. While I have my own wishes for where characters should possibly head, I'm sure the author has much in store for us later! Can't wait. 
I also found that the hbo series followed as closely as possible to the book althouh there were some connections I could only make from reading. So now I need to read ahead of this season.",2012-04-27T19:58:05.000+00:00

,5,Amazing,"I loved this book! Ive only read a handful of fantasy books before and this tops the list of the best ones. Everyone on here complains of the incest and rape in, well it is a book thats in medevil times! Sorry to burst your bubble but it wasnt all hunky dorey in medevil times. Royal families married their brother and sisters to keep the bloodlines pure, and after a victory warriors did indeed rape the women of the town they claimed victory over as a spoil of war. If you thught it was horrible in the book obviously youve never picked up a history book before. But anyways I love books that give the point of view from dozens of characters I get bored easily with just reading about everything from one characters view, so this was a perfect book for me. The way he writes I can perfectly picture this whole world hes created. Love love love this book!",2012-04-16T20:21:42.000+00:00

MLou72,5,"Well-Written, Unexpected, and Highly Entertaining","Rarely do I give a five-star rating to a book. But, I feel that this one is well-deserving. The prose was well-written and easily devoured. George R.R. Martin wrote in a straightforward style&amp;mdash;each chapter highlighting a specific character whom the reader follows throughout the entire book. Though each chapter is written in first-person (a POV that I generally dislike), the characters were developed with depth and sincerity. Unlike some characters in first-person narratives, these have a feeling of authenticity because of their multiple layers. In most narratives, protagonists and antagonists are generally archetypical. However, Martin creates such well-rounded characters that I often found that those I rooted for had disenchanting character flaws, while those I tended to oppose had redeeming qualities. At times, I questioned whether I was rooting for the correct family. And typically, in most fantasies, villains are less intelligent or less cunning than the hero, which is not true in this book. The story is far from formulaic, and caught me off guard at particular moments when strong characters were killed off unexpectedly. The book plays off as historical fiction&amp;mdash;until the fantasy elements come into play. The story would be just as excellent were the fantastical elements removed, but far less entertaining. Though readers who enjoy fantasy or historical fiction would thoroughly enjoy this book, I would highly recommend it to anyone.",2012-04-09T21:16:24.000+00:00

KMolitor,4,A Must Read!,"This book was so awesome, but was hard to follow at first because it jumps around from character to character so much.

It is such a creative story and you definately will love reading it if you are a fantasy fan. :)",2012-03-29T20:53:53.000+00:00

John snow and Ghost..his white Direwolf. I also had a great time following Tyrion Lannister... Arya Stark.... and also Daenerys Targaryen and her moon and stars...Khal Drogo, there are so many great characters I had a hard time not looking ahead to see what trouble they would get into next, I have read a few other books by this author and have to say that these are my favorites by far.... someone please.tell me that there are more books in this series coming soon!!!!

DimWit,3,"Good, but emotionally void","I probably came about this completely backwards...I watched the first season of HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" and then started to read the books. I liked this first book ""Game of Thrones,"" but I wasn't awestruck by it. As a compsnion to the TV series, I thought it filled in some gaps and gave me a better understanding of Westeros. However, I think the story was overly ambitious. The cast of characters too expansive, and I think that was a hinderance. There were too many characters with too many nicknames and some of the details were lost. On top of that there was an emotional void. Where I was personally vested in the characters in the TV show, I didn't feel as much of a connection to the characters in the book. There was too much to process, and I think as a result I didn't care as much what would happen...characters didn't matter so much as plot. I think this was a fine book, but I think it is a better series. While ""Lord of the Rings"" was long and had many characters and those characters had multiple names (I am looking at you Stryder/Aragon) Tolkien had the ability to move the plot forward on an epic scale and made me care deeply for the characters...the films weren't better than the books, they were equally as good. I hope that Martin hits his stride with ""A Clash of Kings.""",2012-02-19T02:15:19.000+00:00

,4,A difficult book to put down,George R R Martin has written an awsome book . It has an unexpected plot you get absorbed in a plot or chapter only to have an unexpected twisr at the end . Beloved charecters are killed  others go missing only to turn up unexpectedly . You get totally sucked into the story waiting to hear about a certain hero or heroines demise . My favourite are Daenerys and Tyrone the dwarf who is always getting out of scrapes but into trouble and is very funny the light humour in the book. Daenareys adds some romance again with unexpected twists. I am now on the third book and it only gets better .,2012-02-12T18:12:17.000+00:00

,5,High fantasy at its finest,"This novel, which I had attempted to read prior to the nook (the font is tiny in the print versions), is at first a little daunting. You have to dig through I think about five chapters before you see a recurring character. This unnerved me at first - this thing is going to be like reading a history book with all the players, I thought - but in actuality, it's not so. You pick up on who's who pretty quickly, and after that it becomes a thrill ride. It's a novel of medieval politics and warfare, and it is addictive. I founf myself loving and loathing some characters. Nearly every character drew an emotional response. They may be royalty, they may be from a whole different world - but you have a vested interest in their wellbeing. That said, loved characters may die, bad guys become sympathetic, and nothing is truly sacred. It will keep you hooked. But be aware - once you've dug through the 700+ pages of this beast, you'll see that it is really just beginning.",2012-01-25T21:47:19.000+00:00

Now as I read, I picture the characters from the show &amp; it has also helped me to follow the many characters &amp; storylines easier because I'm so familiar with it. It's also fun to watch the show again after reading all the amazing details in this book, you notice so many things you missed before.

,5,Hate that I love it,"I reluctantly began reading this series simply to get my husband and his friends to stop bugging me about it. Then, once I finally got past the imperfect grammer and unique writing style, I was hooked.

Believe me, I almost stopped reading many times. The book is clearly not aimed at feminists, bad things often happen to good people, and it sometimes reads like a fantasy soap opera. Despite all this, I cannot put the darn thing or the other books in the series down because there is never a moment where you are free from suspense. 

The book is brutal and dark, and I simply hate how much I love reading it. RR Martin is a great storyteller; enough so it is easy to overlook what would normally cause me to put a book down for good.",2012-01-22T04:58:57.000+00:00

GordonF,3,Solid Fantasy,"Some of the characters are infuriatingly obnoxious, which makes for good story but sometimes I wonder if people can be so single mindedly obtuse if they weren't forced by virtue of the story.

some characters, on the other hand, would make excellent stories in their own right without the background of constant medieval politics.

Honestly, the book droned on a bit in places, I think it could have done with one or two less voices in it than it had, something to make it more compact and less of an epic ramble. Still, if you're a fan of fantasy Martin's voice for it is superb.",2012-01-12T15:33:45.000+00:00

The book lacks substance, and most of the pages are filled with repetitive banal descriptions for the sake of filling pages. Most of the characters&amp;rsquo; discourses have an unnatural and awkward flow. I found myself finishing the book, only for the sake of finishing it. I will not be reading the rest of the series.",2012-01-12T06:42:44.000+00:00

,5,Love!!,"This is the first book in what will be a series of 7 when its all said and done and while i came into the series later than some i flew through all the ones out in about a month (and they aren't short!). This book is not for the feint of heart or those looking immediately for a hero, as it says in the book ""When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die."" and for the most part you die, but i think that that is true to the time the book is set in.  I would highly recommend this book, but it is certainly not for those who are easily offended as it is cruel and at times really disturbing. If you can see past that this book will start you on an amazing journey and introduce you to fantastic characters that you will grow to love and to hate. Don't expect any answers in this book as the whole point of the series is to keep you reading to see where things will lead.",2012-01-03T13:44:13.000+00:00

It's a great book to say the least. However, as a word of warning to young but advanced readers, this book contains bloody violence, disturbing content, and most of all, graphic scenes of sexuality, some of which are homosexual in nature ( not to offend any homosexual persons, merely to inform readers of content).

But i liked it nonetheless and am currently reading book 2 of the series.

,5,Fantasy for adults!,"Many people have criticized A Song of Ice and Fire because of Martin's treatment of his characters.  These people are missing the point.  Too many fantasy novels clearly define the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", and in the end you know that the ""good guys"" will triumph.  Anybody over the age of 10 knows this is not always true.  Sometimes, the good guys DON'T win.  Sometimes, the shrewd and unscrupulous character wins.  Martin treats his audience as mature adults who know this.

The narrative can get a little tedious at times - Martin tends to draw things out.  I find this helps to absorb me deeper into the setting and storyline, but I can understand why it frustrates some people.

At the end of the day, these books are not for everybody.  They are absolutely worth checking out, however.  Give them a try - after all, Winter Is Coming.",2011-12-26T16:38:06.000+00:00

Excellent premise, world and character development, the story moves and the created world is a nice change from the usual sword and scorcery.  Friends have told me that the HBO series based on this novel was excellent.  Now that I've finished the novel I will check it out.  I already started the second in the series.  If the sequels are as good as the first, this series will be in my top 10.",2011-11-28T02:21:35.000+00:00

Genghis_Sean,3,Might-Makes-Right Fantasy Realm with Unsurpassed Depth,"As a lifelong reader of fantasy books and committed enough to them to have a six-year-old daughter named Eowyn, I found this series a unique approach to the genre.  Martin has crafted a world with depth surpassing that of Tolkien himself, but whether or not this is a virtue is a matter for individual readers to decide.  GoT easily has four times the characters of Lord of the Rings, and readers will get bogged down in trying to keep them straight, remembering whether or not they've been encountered before, and caring enough about them to remember them the next time they surface. Furthermore, I wasn't too far into the series before I realized the Martin's books have no true protagonist.  The main character, if there is one, is the realm itself.  That became a problem for me.  I want to root for a character as he struggles to overcome obstacles, injustices, and moral dilemmas.  However, that's very difficult to do in GoT because a significant portion of the characters are inherently despicable, and there is no place in his world for the idealistic, loyal, or principled.  Such characters in his books inevitably fall prey to machinations of the ruthless.  If Martin were to craft a Looney Tunes story, the Roadrunner would have his legs broken, braised, and then fed to him piecemeal by the Coyote while Bugs Bunney was forced to watch.  Sure, there do remain a few admirable characters five books into the series but one must empathize with them cautiously since Martin will undoubtedly kill them off eventually.  I read about Martin's characters with a sort of learned detachment and too often I'm forced to read simply in order to find out what happens next and not because I particularly care about that specific storyline. Still, the series is enjoyable and some of the characters are amazing.  You'll grow to love them, even though you'll sometimes fear to turn the next page.",2011-11-19T14:40:43.000+00:00

Sharp007,5,Involving and Complex,"I am just beginning the the fourth book, ""Feast of Crows,"" and I am as deeply immersed and fascinated as I began. I can summarize in this way: Are you a fan of ""Lost?"" Do you like unpredictable, complex story lines and fully developed, deeply human characters? Do you want a rich setting apparently created by a profound understanding of medieval history, with some well placed fantasy thrown in? Then you will love the series. This is not beach reading. This is not typical fantasy, a few simple characters and some swords. This is literature. If you don't have patience or much time, it is not worth your while. But if you do, you will be well rewarded.",2011-10-16T02:04:54.000+00:00

,5,Enjoyable and Intense!,"After much debating (and reading through reviews here), I decided to take the plunge and read A Game of Thrones and wow, am I glad I did.  Don't let a large cast of characters turn you off; I was a bit worried when I started the book since it took me awhile to figure out who was who, but when I did it was worth it.  The characters are immensely enjoyable and their interactions make for a great drama.  Throughout the book, there is the veil of darkness looming in the north, and the author does a great job building up suspense of what is to come, as well as suspense between the characters.  I am very excited to begin the second book in this series!",2011-10-12T17:27:03.000+00:00

Ron Tiede,3,Dont Start - There's a fifth book,Enjoyed the first two but expected something more from the third &amp; certainly the fourth.  The revelation that there's a fifth was disappointing when the last two dragged.,2011-10-11T01:05:57.000+00:00
KirkusMacGowan,4,Felt Like a Medieval Political Thriller,"From the beginning, Martin's style of writing hooked me. His ability to write an epic story is apparent from the first paragraph. The book is told from multiple points of view, always in third person limited. The name of each chapter, or section, is the character whose point of view we are reading.

Martin does an amazing job with world building in the prologue and first few chapters. The reader is then introduced to a family of lords, which much of the book revolves around. The main plot involves the king asking a grand favor of Lord Eddard Stark, they are old friends and have not seen each other in years. Stark's decision to follow, or not, begins the story. The repercussions of each decision and how they lead to other plot elements is astounding. Much of the story then revolves around Stark's children, and their own personal stories. There are more characters introduced throughout, but their true role in the story is not known to the reader.

The book has an abundance of political intrigues, mixed with some fantasy elements, new forged friendships, betrayal, and death. The depth of character development is stunning, and it is easy to find oneself being drawn into their individual stories.

A Game of Thrones was written beautifully, with a great plot, and multiple sub-plots, but the it felt like a set up for the series, as if it were a prologue in and of itself. Though it was written as part of a series, I would have liked to see a bigger climax, something epic you could say.

The only other negative was that the fantastic elements were rare. There are some in the beginning, sprinkled throughout the middle, then more at the end. As a fantasy, I assumed there would be more. As I stated before, it read like one long prologue, so I am hoping for more on the fantastic side throughout the rest of the series.

Based on the lack of fantasy elements, and the not so epic ending, I was going to give it three of five stars. However, his beautiful writing style, and his ability to tell an epic story make it easy to give four of five stars.

Get ready to dig in for a great read and be aware of the sub-plots. These are dark times; you never know what could happen.",2011-10-10T18:48:31.000+00:00

ScaryCarrie,5,GREAT READ,"I'd heard the series on HBO was good but don't subscribe so thought I would try it out.  At first it started a bit slow, but I was hooked before very long and think I am addicted.  Great adventure and well crafted plot with characters.  I'll definitely be buying the rest of the series.",2011-09-10T21:08:32.000+00:00

Genevieve Love,5,Beautifully written,At first this book did not catch my interest but i decided to pick it up again because so many people were praising it. Once the story gets going you become absorbed and can easily paint the characters and land scape in your mind. I cant wait to read the next novel. Also I recently started watching the hbo series and I am glad I read the book first. The series is well done but the story line seems rushed and it is not as personal as the book.,2011-09-08T21:34:55.000+00:00

Jennifer Alvarez,5,At first glance.....,"I had tried to read the sample of this book before but i felt like it wasn't worth my time.  Then i chanced upon their facebook page and it sparked my interest one more time.  And boy am i glad! Just when i thought i have run out of good books to read, this is the best one yet!  The storyline and chatacters are so engaging, and there are numerous dialogues worth remembering. WINTER IS COMING!",2011-09-05T12:51:17.000+00:00

Muggle_Reader,5,Exceed my expectations,I have to admit i didnt expect this book to be as spectacular as i thought it would be but George has a way of wrapping the reader into his story so well that it comes naturally. Critics who refer to an author as the 'American Tolkien' does not go unheeded. I had to find out for myself what the big commotion was all about and boy was i glad i did. Such an engaging amd realistic story. Highly recommended!!!,2011-08-29T04:02:12.000+00:00

Karen Schweitzer,5,A Must Read,"I absolutely loved this book. I knew that it was popular but I was surprised by how much I liked it. The characters are well drawn and the description is excellent. The book is very long, but the multi-character POV and the short chapters make it feel like a page turner. The plot is also interesting and well-thought out. The book has a satisfying ending but there is also a cliffhanger. Don't be surprised if you are compelled to read the sequel right away. I bought it and I'm looking forward to reading it. If you enjoy the book, you will definitely want to check out the TV show on HBO. It is VERY similar to the book and almost as enjoyable. In short, if you like light fantasy and historical fiction, you will like this book.",2011-08-27T01:21:26.000+00:00

One thing I will say is that the TV series is very true to this first installment of the book series, but I was not disappointed with the read. The characters aren't simply black and white. They are complex and true to life. I enjoyed the unexpected ending and couldn't wait to pick up the next book in this series.",2011-08-25T02:02:05.000+00:00

Ribcage,5,Couldn't put it down,"First off, it's only like the LotR in the sense that it is fantasy. It's got swords, and thrones, and dark things that aren't entirely human. However, it's completely its own story. It reminds me of a multi-way chess game, yet so much deeper.

Martin kept me wanting to turn to the next page, even in my sleep. Upon finishing, I immediately ordered myself the box set so I'd never have to wait to read the next book again! &lt;3",2011-08-16T13:33:16.000+00:00

Rebecca27,4,It's too real and raw for some people.,"Keep that in mind when reading these or even watching the tv series. The reality and emotions in life take hold with this series, and it's REAL. People often get into this fantasy world with Medieval times fiction, but it was not the real world back then. It was a fight for power and survival, plain and simple. They indulged a lot like people today, but the mortality rate was much higher. Historically, everything in the books probably happened in real life, and then some. Yes, incest is disgusting, but sticking your head in the sand and thinking it doesn't happen is just naive. I was taken aback by that story line as well, but I know that throughout history there were many cases of it. They thought it would keep the blood pure, and money had a lot to do with it. A ""keep the money in the family"" sort of situation.",2011-08-15T02:29:57.000+00:00

JDanow,5,Simply Amazing!,"I have never read any sort of book like this before. I never imagined I would like it; let alone love it! I couldn't put the book down! I love the characters and the way the author paints such vivid pictures, and you can't help but picture every little detail. The characters are easy to love/hate and although the trials they go through during their everyday lives isn't anything we've ever experienced, the story is written so well that you can empathize with each of the characters. The first 25% of the book is set up and introduction of the characters, if you can get past this part it's well worth it. Also, I highly recommend making yourself familiar with the appendix of characters in the back of the book it will make reading the book much easier. I am moving onto book two ""A Clash of Kings"" and I can't wait to get started!",2011-08-12T12:48:33.000+00:00

Antonio Chiles,4,A True Pleasure But....,"Martins books are the pinnacle of fantasy novels. However, though I hate to bring it up, whats taking so long George? Which leads me to my next point, Book 4 was dissapointing to say the least. After 5 years you would think that it would reach mediocrity. It seemed to be 700+ pages of, for the most part, irrelevant  information. Martin claimed that A Song of Ice and Fire will be 7 novels long. He is currently in his late 60's (I believe). At his current rate I fear whether or not he will finish this epic, and he has stated that no one will finish the series in his absence (Robert Jordan WoT). With this in mind I give warning: be prepared to wait a long time for future installments in the series. Thankfully book 5 recently came out.  If youre looking for a great read then pick this book (or nook) up.                                                                                               ---AGC",2011-08-09T06:02:36.000+00:00

,5,Amazing - Keeps you on your toes!,When I first saw this book its size was very intimidating but I have since read it and was AMAZING!!! The so called chapters (because it goes by characature not chapters)keep you on your toes because it skips from characature to characature but it doesn't jump back and forth like most of its kind making it easier to read than it looks. The story line is amazing!!! It is the longest book I have ever read but it was well worth it and I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!!,2011-07-27T16:41:14.000+00:00

,3,"...ehhh, kinda sorta","I don't know...it's really well written but the book is really long. About 800 pages. I read the Harry Potter series and thought 800 pages was nothing but the content within the book...it's really slow. Almost as if you're really there living it day by day. That's not really my kind of book but I mean, it's interesting. I'm most certainly not reading the rest of the series...especially since every book is the same, I started the second one...it was the same slow rhythm...not a bad thing, not a good thing. If you're into mid-evil science fiction, go for it. It's extremely historically accurate but just really long. Long to the point where I lost interest and didn't feel like finishing it...finishing it was hard...almost boring. I had to push through the pages as fast as possible it took me about 7 days to get through it, which is way longer than the usual 5-10 hours it takes me to read longer written books. I kept falling asleep so many times...because it's just long and boring. Not a lot happens at one time...just kind of spread out, spread out really far...like really really far. 800 pages is a chance for an enjoyable adventure...but also a boring endeavor.",2011-07-19T03:36:21.000+00:00

Crashed,5,Amazing start to an amazing series,"I read this book as well as thevrest of the series as many have on this site. I can also highly recommend this book. It starts out slow yet brutal in its stern flow of events. With great character depth and perspective, it tells a great story full of war, betrayal, and conspiracy. A truely realistic and bitter fantasy as the world forgets the ages of old into a start of uncertainty with death and war in its bloom.   The only negative I can say would be that the book at times may drag at some points. This is due to some amazing events occurring right before the next chapter starts with a character change, as the book is told through each character's perspective. This isn't a major issue, as the story as a whole is awesome. It just makes me ache a little to see how things turn out.  That is what this book does well. It makes you get hooked to the point that you're dying to read it as fast as you can till the end - a good thing.  The first book is a tad slow, but only because its taking you through the world and up the mountain before you start the wild ride down the cliff into a awesomely dizzing crash into great twists and sub plots.    A must buy for any fantasy reader!!",2011-07-18T08:18:47.000+00:00

Lady-Gar,5,Escape the world into the Seven Kingdoms,"Such a great read that flows beautifully through an epic tale. Rich characters and fantasy world with high drama and lots of twists and turns. Plenty of characters to love and hate (in a good way) and some you can't decide either way. The story keeps you riveted and it is hard to put down. Sometimes the author gets a little hung up on details about house sigils descriptions, but if you stick with it he is an artist painting a picture. Otherwise the story has fantastic flow. Deffinately a fantastic read for any fantasy reader.",2011-07-17T03:31:39.000+00:00

barnsiefan,5,highly addictive,"This is the best fantasy series I have read in a long time!! Typically when reading any new fantasy series I can't help but think that the author has stolen half of their plot from another author such as Tolkien...but this never once occured to me while I was reading this higly original and imaginative series. Additionally, in spite of being a fantasy series it is quite realistic in that the characters have a great amount of depth, the lines between good and evil are not always clear, and the good guy does not always triumph. These are such lenghty books and they have so many wonderful qualities that it is difficult to summarize everything that makes them so marvelous...so suffice it to say that you will not be disappointed and in fact you may find yourself completely addicted.",2011-07-16T13:55:42.000+00:00

harley201,5,I Highly Recommend this Series.,"There are so many diffrent caricatures. Some you will hate, some you will feel empathy for. As you begin to immerse yourself into,this wonderful story, you find people whom you believed would be in the entire series are not..No body is safe in this novel.People are killed off at an alarming rate you begin to wonder, Who will be left. Some of the charictures,that you hated in the beginning you will come to realize, they are not the villans you first thought they were. Enjoy the ride, I have read the first 4 books. And ready to get into the Fith one of the series.",2011-07-15T20:16:07.000+00:00

Jen_ds3,4,"Great book, terrible reader.","First of all, I'm reading/listening to these book because I fell in love with the HBO series. So far, I'm very pleased with the book, but the guy reading this one is terrible. He doesn't even get the characters' names right - I've already heard ""Katelyn"", ""Brian"", ""Mickon"", and ""Jeffrey"". It's like misspellings or grammar mistakes, it takes me right out of the story.",2011-07-12T17:54:03.000+00:00

Dave Geiger,1,Disappointed,"Well written, though very verbose.  My disappointment was that of the five or six main subplots, only two were really brought to any sort of conclusion. The others are just left dangling.  It's sort of like reading a VERY long prolog.  If you're planning to read the entire series, this may be worthwhile, but as a stand alone novel it is very lacking.  If are expecting George R. R. Martin to be another J. R. R. Tolkien you will be sadly disappointed.   There are no humorous moments, and very few heroic ones. lots of political intrigue, nearly all of which concludes in a negative way.",2011-07-11T01:25:06.000+00:00

CocoGoddess14,5,One of the best books I've read since LOTR,"I watched the series on HBO and was intrigued, so I purchased the book. So glad I did! The author was excellent in describing the  landscape and characters, giving the reader just enough info to keep reading. I fell in love with some of the characters; while others I hated with a passion. The good thing is that the show kept pace with the book while other books that have been turned into shows have been drastically changed. This was an excellent read. I look forward to reading the rest of the series and watching the next season on HBO. If you're looking for action,political intrigue and fantasy thrown in, then this is the series for you.",2011-07-10T15:00:50.000+00:00

sean baran,5,Excellent Book,I didn't catch the show on HBO until halfway through. I was hooked but didn't know what was going on. I decided to read the book and from then on everthing made sense. Reading the book made it easy to follow the show. I'm on the second book now!!,2011-07-05T02:43:54.000+00:00

Katie23,5,Fantastic,"This series is amazing. Suspenseful and captivating, George RR Martin will pull you in and you'll be hooked from the first chapter. Comparisons between Martin and Tolkien are obvious, but honestly they're a little unfair. Tolkien was a genius, but Martin is certainly brilliant in his own right.

Fallensaver,5,You owe it to yourself to read this novel,"Like many people, I began the novel because of the new HBO adaptation, and like many people, I fell in love with it. Maybe it was the politically enriched story, the vivid characters, the gritty realism, or maybe all three. This review is meant to find out. 

     Story- A Game of Thrones begins in the land known as Winterfell, where the people are as fierce and cold as the weather. The faction that inhabits Winterfell is the House of Stark, which is led by Lord Eddard Stark (Ned). Ned, and his family, is forced to leave the confines of Winterfell so that Ned can be the Hand of the King. This begins a tale of heartbreak, politics and deceit. You are in for a treat if you enjoy political maneuvering. 

    Characters- A Game of Thrones biggest strength is its characters. Somehow Martin was able to follow the point of views (POV's) of eight distinctive characters while providing extensive details and back story. 
Here is a list of the POV characters 

1.Eddard Stark(Ned)-Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. Ned's flaw is his honor.

2.Catlyn Stark (Cat)- Wife of Ned. Though not as fierce or honorable as her husband, Cat should not be mistaken for a fool. 

3.Bran Stark-Second youngest son of Ned and Cat Stark. Bran loves to explore and climb the castles of Winterfell. 

4.Tyrion Lannister-One of the lords of the wealthy House of Lannister. Though Tyrion is the size of a small child, his intellect and witty lines (you will laugh at many of his lines) gets him out of dangerous situations. 

5.Arya Stark-One of two daughters of Ned and Cat Stark. Arya is quick to anger and is more akin to a ""tomboy"" than a lady of the House of Stark. 

6.Sansa Stark- The other daughter of Ned and Cat. Sansa is a pompous princess whose only goal is to marry the prince of the Seven Kingdom. 

7. Jon Snow- Bastard son of Ned Stark. Jon is sent to protect the Seven Kingdoms at a place known as the Wall. Jon is arguably the smartest of Ned's children and is a superb swordsman. 

8. Daenerys Targaryen (Dani) - Daughter of the defeated king, Aegon the Conqueror (imagine Hitler). Dani is a timid girl who listens to the orders of her overbearing brother,Viserys. Though I will not list the extensive cast of side characters, I can ensure you that all of them are fleshed out nicely. Some of the side characters are just as interesting as the main characters. 

    Gritty Realism- Make no mistake; this book is not for those who want a purely black and white story. Martin purposely weaves a tale in which the characters act just like real humans would. There is alcohol, whorehouses, greed, political maneuvering, incest and much more. Martin should not be vilified for showing the true face of humanity; he should be applauded for having the guts to show humanity in this light.   

   Conclusion Though many people will be content with just watching the HBO adaptation, you owe it to yourself to spend the wee hours of the night being immersed in the masterpiece that Martin has created.",2011-06-26T05:04:12.000+00:00

3000ways,5,Awesome book and awesome story telling!!!,"Never in my life have I ever been as addicted to reading a book as I was for the Song of Ice and Fire series. Epic, amazing, cruel, partly pornographic, funny, and an absolute blast to read. I've read other classics such as Belgariad novels, Lord of the Rings, and the Wheel of Time novels and none compare to this book. Nearly every story I've read or watched has had a central hero and villain theme, but the awesome part about A Song of Ice and Fire is that there really isn't a central hero or villain, everybody has done good and everybody has done some dirt. I just wish Mr. Martin would hurry up and finish the series.",2011-06-23T03:36:35.000+00:00

LOTRMaori,5,Fantastic!,A game of thrones is a great book to read. George R.R. Martin delivers a fantastic piece of fantasy literature. I would rate it next to Tolkiens works for fantasy pieces as it is truly spectacular. A five out of five stars well earned.,2011-06-20T23:54:20.000+00:00

bbratley,5,Highly Recommend!,"I am SO impressed with this series.  It draws you in right from the beginning. I am a voracious readers of all genres, but it is a rare occasion that I find a book/series that completely and utterly draws me in.  I do know the characters, I do feel what they feel, I hurt for them and with them and never, ever want to story to end.  This series has so many twists and turns, shocks and edge of your seat action.  What an amazing, unique story teller George R.R. Martin is.  I can't even imagine how he can have such an out of this world storytelling ability.  Even if you are not totally into fantasy type books, or medieval type stories, this is so much more than that.  Like I said you  will be drawn in, you will never want it to end.  AND, I am absolutely thrilled at how close the HBO series stays true to the books.  Do yourself a favor, give yourself a treat and give these books a try, you will not be disappointed!",2011-06-19T07:36:09.000+00:00

kuhwee,5,LOTR meets The Sopranos,"Game of Thrones is not one of your typical fantasy novels that involves a hero that defeats evil. Martin focuses more on the psyche of each character and their role in their world. The story, as a whole, is  about the struggle for power and how each character deals with it. Each character has their strengths and their flaws, which results in them being grey instead of black and white. You can really identify with or absolutely despise the characters that Martin created. It is dark, gritty, and very shocking but this is the kind of stuff that reflects reality and the lust for power.

I could not put it down once I picked it up. I highly recommend this for any reader who appreciates great writing and amazing creativity.",2011-06-19T00:27:26.000+00:00

Pixie52,5,Just a warning,"Loved these books. That being said, the author did tell his readers that the fourth and fifth books were written in conjunction, but somehow there's a five year gap between those books. And other books written between. Now if you are the type of person who would be irritated by that, because you will love this series, maybe you should wait for them all to be completed before picking it up.",2011-06-16T07:50:23.000+00:00

MandaLaine,5,Tons of characters.,This book is fantastic.  The characters are really deep and I found myself really caring for them and getting really angry (spoiler alert) most of them die.  There are a ton of characters so you really have to pay attention and use the appendix.  Of course ends on multiple cliffhangers so you buy the next book.  Really good read.,2011-06-15T18:56:40.000+00:00

,5,Epic story line,"The first book in this series is pretty good.  At first, switching from character to character was a little odd, however, after the first few times it's natural and the story line picks up where the previous character leaves off.  It's interesting to root for all sides in the story (even the ""bad"" guys) because you see it from their perspective.  As the fifth book is about to come out, I don't think the series has been abandoned.",2011-06-12T00:06:46.000+00:00

,1,Heavy and dark--can't recommend without anti-depressants,"I only was able to get into this book about 100 pages before I was too depressed to go any further.  I had high hopes since this looks to be a long series I could have read for a long time.  I know things need to be set early in this sort of epic novel but this was just too heavy. There didn't appear to be anything beautiful or noble for the protagonists to work for.  Very disappointing!

Spoiler alert--don't read any further if you actually intend to read this book and series--one lady goes crazy, a kid falls off the roof (was actually pushed) and is paralyzed, and the nicest wolf is killed by the girl's father, death, death, death and no end in sight.",2011-06-09T03:56:43.000+00:00

Griffin_Clark,5,The Fantasy Epic of Our Generation,"I began A Game of Thrones reluctantly, in fear that I was beginning something that would perhaps never be complete. I followed the novels for some time, as I do often before purchasing a book, and realized that it appeared Martin had abandoned the series with it being some five years after the last novel. Then I caught wind of the HBO series and discovered that Martin was not only writing episodes for the series, but was also preparing to release the next novel in the saga. So, I decided to jump in, and words cannot describe how glad I am that I finally did.

There are several words to describe A Game of Thrones: epic, violent, dismal, cold, and the list goes on. What draws this sprawling epic together is the skillful weaving of a believable world with a believable history and those that reside within it, which I must say are some of the most interesting characters I have ever read about. The intricacies that form naturally between people every day are displayed to the utmost perfection here and they truly reveal the best and worst of all of us. This book is not like other fantasy novels with a simple good versus evil plot. In fact, often times when reading through GoT I found myself questioning who really was good or evil. It is this vivid painting of the ""grey"" area within each of us that makes this work of art a masterpiece that stands out in a genre filled with cliches. The characters feel so much like living and breathing people that I feel that I know each of them pesonally. Never have I so fiercely felt connected to a character as I do with Ned Stark. He is humble and honorable in a world filled with treachorous snakes, and the trials he endures are heartwrenching. The almost mystical thing about this novel, though, is that each character feels as real as the main character and as you read you will find that your opinions about a certain character may be one way in the beginning, yet totally different by the end. I won't go much into plot here because doing so would only dishoner its brilliance. Just trust me, it is incredible.

Now, this is the only book in the series I have read thus far and I have read many reviews from other consumers that complain about the fact the the later books feel like they are going nowhere, with new questions arising, but no solutions to old problems facing the characters from previous novels. I have yet to see if this is true, but I will say that, as an aspiring author myself, it is obvious that this novel, through the hard work of Martin, has become a living, breathing entity with a mind and heart of its own. In other words, stories, especially large ones, often begin to write themselves, thus the reason that this series went from 3 books to 7. So be patient with Martin. He is one of writing's greatest talents and I am sure he wants to take his time so that he can grasp the entirety of this epic and tie it all together by the end of book 7.

What the hell are you doing still reading this review? Do yourself a favor and purchase this amazing novel. It is history in the making and any reader should feel privileged to be a part of it.",2011-06-06T17:37:09.000+00:00

Amanda Curtis,5,Wonderful start to a winderful series!,"I first read this book long before it became an HBO series and loved it back then. Now, I am so far pleasantly surprised with the series and have started re-reading the books.  I just hope this motivates the release of the latest book in the series- A Dance With Dragons! A must read. My favorite high fantasy series to date!",2011-05-30T21:52:10.000+00:00

Tinkie78,5,Highly recommended you will ENJOY this series!!,"I love this series! I love how it is written to follow many not just one.  I really enjoy how you never know what is to come, you can't assume anything.  Sometimes the houses get a little confusing.  I found if you flip to the back of the book it lists each house and a little bit about them.  I suggest read that first and even if you question who someone is in the middle great reference to the houses and history lines.",2011-05-29T04:06:51.000+00:00

LN_Adcox,5,WORTHY OF ALL THE HOOPLA,"I couldn't help but notice Martin's books in ""A Song of Ice And Fire"" series being promoted at my favorite bookstores and this book being touted as an HBO mini series (which I recorded without watching while I read this book).  Hence I had to find out what all the hoopla was about.  I discovered it was deserved.  This book has an engrossing, mature plot replete with conflict, action, and excellent characterization.  The fantasy is present as the setting is in a world of Martin's imagination where summer and winter can last for decades, dire wolves roam, dragons are still a memory, and a gigantic wall of ice holds back mysterious and loathsome creatures.  However, I felt comfortable and familiar in this world as it is a feudal society reminiscent of European society during the Middle Ages.  The aspirations, intrigues, alliances, and wars of the aristocracy mirror those of our feudal ancestors from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries.  Each chapter is about or told from the viewpoint of the various characters that we get to know well.  Armies have clashed in this ""game of thrones"", but the outcome is far from settled at the end of the book.  The reader had best have the next book of the series on hand when this one is finished.",2011-05-27T14:50:46.000+00:00

PepaLou,5,Absolutely fantastic,"I'm not usually a fan of stories like this, but I was hooked from page 1.  Absolutely brilliant.  Loved every word.",2011-05-16T02:19:03.000+00:00
UnaFragger,1,too wordy,"i cant get through it. the author is too long winded and splits focus between too many characters.  fewer more well developed characters would be far better than the 20 or so that seem overly similar.  in addition, everyone has the same name. its just too much effort to read.",2011-05-16T02:17:16.000+00:00

Staycee19,5,A well written epic tale,"From the first paged i was hooked. The character development was intricate yet easy to follow.

Tasz,1,Seems like a good series at first,I am debating bothering to finish book three and will not bother to buy book four. This is a never ending soap opera disguised as a fantasy series. I am tired of getting to know characters only to have them act stupidly and then get killed off. Then he brings in someone else to kill off ad nauseum. I have started to skip entire paragraphs of boring detail and mundane conversation to find out if the character has been killed off at the end of the chapter. I read fantasy for the disconnect not for the reality. I forsee an unending series of books that cost me at least eight dollars each. I'm moving on and figure Mr. Martin can get rich off the other suckers.,2011-05-05T12:35:37.000+00:00

Ranger76,5,Highly recommended,"Although I have heard of the series, it was never one of my top reading topics. When the book was made into an HBO series I decided to start reading them.  It's an awesome story, well written and with lot of characters and different plots. I'm sorry I did not start reading the series long time ago.  I have to agree with the author that in order to give a great book, time is not as important as the quality of the text. Thanks George for your well written book",2011-04-29T14:27:34.000+00:00

Jennifer Wong,5,Amazing,Great book that is well written and a fun to read.  I just staryed book three in the series.  The characters are amazing and the story is vast.  Book five us coming this spring.  Can't wait to read it.,2011-04-26T02:56:42.000+00:00
Jimmy_Dog,5,"Oh sweet Buddha, yes.","This book is amazing. If it were a woman, I'd take it out to dinner. And not like McDonald's or Burger King (or even Chik-Fil-A!), but like Olive Garden or Red Lobster. Then I'd laugh at her jokes and let her off of my plate, even if I wanted to push her away and stab her with my fork. Then I'd go shopping with her, even for shoes! Then back to my place where she'd tell me she was on her period, but I wouldn't care because she is so awesome I know I'll do her soon. 

Cliffs: I enjoyed this book.",2011-04-26T01:57:32.000+00:00

Mupples,5,Deserves a second read.,"The first time I read this, I could not get anyone straight. I thought it was laggy and filled with too many characters (as epic fantasy would dictate.) After watching the awesomely visual HBO pilot, I re read it. Took my time and really concentrated on the characters stations and movements. I got so much out of it that I did not notice before. Who is Jon Snow really? Will anyone stop Jofferys reign? Will Daerneys take the western kingdom? Does Jorah have alterior motives? I guess I have to continue to find out. It is that addicting.",2011-04-21T23:12:35.000+00:00

Blake Carswell,5,Game of Thrones,"Many ppl have told me how wonderful this series is, and I was skeptical.   I'm not usually impressed with books that are so built up because nothing can live up to that much praise.  Furthermore, I saw in the appendix how complicated the family structures are.  There must be over 100 different characters.  I expected them to blend in after awhile.  When my expectations are wrong, however, I admit it.  I was skeptical, but now I will say this is one of the best books I've read this year...probably the best I've read in many years. If I could give it six stars, I would.  George writes complex characters who I became attatched to.  As a friend said, however, none of the characters are sacred.  George can and will kill any character at any time, which just adds to the excitment and makes GoT really unpredictable.  Also,  the chapters almost always end on a climax and I found myself bouncing up and down and screaming, 'Nooooooooo!' on several occasions.  I would have to put my Nook down, but I couldn't wait to pick it up again and continue reading.  Honestly one of the best fantasies I've read.",2011-04-21T19:43:48.000+00:00

csaint,1,Waste of Time,I work at a book store and tons of people have recommended this series to me. I finally decided to give it a chance-all I can say is...what the hell? The plot was boring and it was downright degrading to women. All of the characters were nasty and corrupt and there was not a single cause for the good in this book. It was an altogether depressing lot of characters. I will not read Martin again.,2011-04-13T03:44:00.000+00:00

Timothy Elmer,5,Better than Tolkien?,"Nope, just different. An excellent read on par with LoTR, and he does an amazing job writing from the different viewpoints of the characters. WARNING! Do not expect to see this series completed until you have children and they graduate high school. I read this book for the first time in paperback 15 years ago and Book 5 hits the shelves in June of this year. I can honestly say he's worth the wait.",2011-04-09T15:16:13.000+00:00

emmi331,5,Outstanding Start to a New Series,"I don't usually read fantasies, but this drew me in from the first page and didn't let go.  One reason it worked for me is that while it's fantasy, the fantastical element isn't overdone.  No faeries, elves, magical powers, or weird creatures, though there are some supernatural elements.  These are humans, who are people you care about. The setting is similar to medieval England - in fact the map provided shows a country remarkably similar in shape to Great Britain. The writing is straightforward and narrative-driven;  I was glued to the book and hated seeing it end.  I can't wait to continue with the next in the series.",2011-04-07T21:06:01.000+00:00

,2,Chaotic at best,"The series of books does have twist and turns filled with deceit and cruelty. Wat too Many of the main characters are children, with them performing great deeds and surviving things most adult would not. Falls into the ""Come on Man"".....or who cares area. What ever you do, do not start liking a character because they will not be there or suddenly turn evil or good or come back to life. Just chaos trying to follow and fathom purpose as to why certain twists take so drastic a turn. This series I read hoping that somewhere it would be pulled together and make sense. I love the character Jon and his adventures but there are way too many children characters and the book is loaded with horrific murder, incest, rape, and worse. I keep reading that this is some sort of Classic series. Some parts are fantastic and do show hints of master story telling but as a whole it is far from being ranked with other works of art that have been written and called a Classics. One thing I did come away learning is a Surname name means everything in this and the nameless are just cannon fodder.",2011-04-03T23:56:47.000+00:00

katydid8,1,Wish I could get my $8.99 back,"Based on the high ratings of this book, I ventured into fantasy for the first time. I am an avid reader and read probably 50 books a year, mostly historical fiction (i.e. Diana Gabaldon, James Mitchener) and adventure (i.e. James Rollins and Harlen Coben) In all fairness, I have to say I didn't even finish this book. I read to relax and lose myself in a story. This book made me feel like I needed to be taking notes the many many characters, lineage, places, non-humans, etc..I just can't enjoy a book when I feel like I need to go back to remember who was who and what they did and who they're married to, etc... Plus reading the gruesome details of rape and murder in just about every chapter is disturbing. I think the author is a disturbed individual.",2011-03-29T15:14:37.000+00:00

Jasmyn9,5,A Song of Ice and Fire,"The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten. The first book in the series centers around the Stark family, the lords of the northernmost part of the kingdom, and the last Targaryens. The Starks, close friends of King Robert, are quickly drawn into the turmoil at court without realizing it. The Stark children are fascinating. I find it difficult to pick a favorite of the four (five if you count Lord Stark's bastard). The last of the Targaryens plot revenge and invasion from across the seas to reclaim their throne. Daenarys Targaryen is one of my absolute favorite characters of all time. The Princess is soft and delicate, yet hard and proud when the situation calls for it. I find it very difficult to describe the story without giving too much away about the characters and the plot. I admire Martin's honest writing. He does not flinch from including practices that were very common in real life medieval kingdoms: murder, execution, brothels, arranged marriages, and abuse. The way he weaves it into the story only enhances the sense of realism. Now, I don't want to scare anyone away. While the times were brutal, Martin is not overly graphic in a way some writers can be. It's there for a reason, not for only for shock effect. The kingdom sits on the brink...on the brink of war, destruction, and invasion. But no one realizes it yet. The noble families of the kingdom are about to be plunged into a web of lies and intrigue. Even the most honorable among them will find themselves doubting those they trusted the most and doing things would have never considered in the past. The peace has lasted too long and people are growing soft, but as they say, ""Winter is coming."" And this one promises to be long. 5/5",2011-03-14T14:29:39.000+00:00

,2,Nothing like Tolkein!,"I trudged through all of the existing 4 novels in this series hoping to find enough redeeming qualities to justify my investment, and came away sorely disapointed. Authors like Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time), Tolkien (LOTR), and even Terry Goodkind (Sword of Truth), all spin intense tales that leave you encouraged and inspired by the actions of their heros; Martin grinds through character after character, who all seem to perish by one betrayal after another. As soon as you start rooting for someone, they end up on the chopping block...this repeats so often that you can't help but wonder what holds the story together.

These novels are more like a soap opera than an epic fantasy series- murder, betrayal, and graphically portrayed incest/rape seem to be Martin's bread and butter, with practially nothing else in between.

For some strange reason, I find that highly disgusting and will go back to reading books with real heros and goals that I can emotionally (and morally) rally behind.",2011-03-03T23:21:21.000+00:00

FARIEQUEENE,5,An Amazing Trip,"Such a delightful step away from commonplace fantasy. This novel is complex, deep, and unpredictable as well as gritty.  Martin's characters are whole and engaging.  The constant clash between houses rips the reader from a traditional fantasy and instead immerses them into a richly multi-faceted story.  I cannot wait to read the second book.  If you want less magic, less elves and hi-jink and more realistic fiction with a tinge of unpredictable fantasy, read this series.",2011-01-30T18:27:13.000+00:00

going4broke2005,5,Excellent Book and Series BUT!!!!!!!,"I highly recommend all of the books in this series.  My only problem is if he will ever finish this series properly.  Robert Jordon had an excellent WOT series and passed away before he concluded it and I fear the same here.  He has been so busy with other things and the Game of Thrones series on HBO that he hasn't put forth the time to finish # 5.  It is frustrating when you have to wait years between books because you forget so much from the prior work.  Oh well, if you don't mind waiting 4 - 5 years between books then read it.  You will not be disappointed in the first four and it will leave you wanting more (for me over 4 years now).",2011-01-19T20:14:11.000+00:00

JGolomb,5,Epic Medieval Fantasy,"""A Game of Thrones"" is a deep, broad and compelling work of medieval-style fantasy. I'm not a reader of much fantasy, but after watching a preview of the new HBO series (starting in April 2011), I found myself drawn in by the mystique, texture and composition of the story.

The twisting and extensive story is equal parts medieval historical fiction and fantasy. The book is long at over 700 pages, many taken up with well-crafted character development and exposition. The scenery, outfits, and activities are very middle ages European: well-hewn swords, knights in armor that gleams in a multitude of metallic shades, both honor and treachery are driving motivations for characters at all levels of the social stratosphere. There's a wee bit of magic, a zombie or two, and no fantasy-themed story can go too long without dragon lore.

The characters and backstories are plentiful and complicated. Martin has written detailed histories on all of the royal houses in an appendix and it will take more than a few references in your reading to get your arms around and feel comfortable with who's who and which houses are allies and which are enemies. 

The core of the story revolves around the mysterious death of a key advisor to the king. His wife sends a message to her sister suggesting that the death was murder. This plot point is only a small device used as a launching point for the exploration of Martin's incredibly rich universe. Two houses are at odds...House Stark, led by the infinitely honorable, patient and noble Eddard Stark, and House Lannister, led by the irrepressibly conniving Cersei, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and inheritor of a bloodline of dubious quality.

""Game of Thrones"" is heavy...in details, exposition, in character development, and in world-building. It's not light reading, but it's fulfilling. ""Thrones"" is the first in a series by Martin and while some stories are built and resolved within ""Thrones"", very little is truly concluded. I find my mind drifting back To Martin's world a few days after I finished reading, and I think it won't be long before I return to the land of ""Thrones"".",2011-01-16T13:39:52.000+00:00

Endrew,3,Great Beginning to a LONG story.. that doesn't end here,"Don't read this if you don't plan on reading the complete series, this book is simply an introduction to the entire saga. There is no resolution in this novel and it is essentially the world building and background to the entire saga. With that said the story is good, the action (once it starts) is exciting, violent, and not for the faint at heart. This is not a ""feel good, happy ending"" story. This novel is written in a way that you can root for nearly any side of the multi-faceted conflict. To say Martin is ""long winded"" would not be correct, possibly overly thorough? At times I felt he was providing descriptions, depth, and names to set a scene that was unnecessary. I continually found myself wanting to know more about the story line and story movement, but was bogged down in words. This is a personal preference I think depending on the reader. All and all it was a good book, I'm sure I will read the others, but I don't feel compelled to get book 2 right after this one.",2011-01-08T03:08:35.000+00:00

FoustianBargain,4,Great read but you'll be an old man before the series ends,You know your in trouble when the author thinks he is writing three books and ends up writing 7.  This work is a masterpiece but George RR Martin is going to take a while finishing the series so if you have patience and are willing to wait another 5-11 years for the series to be completed I highly recommend this book.,2010-10-24T12:21:46.000+00:00

WinterfellMom,5,"Love the book, ebook has a lot of typos.","I read this book years ago and it is without a doubt one of the best I have ever read. The series is amazing!! The ebook however is riddled with typos that are annoying and distracting. As someone who loves the book, I'm disappointed as I just finished reading the ebook and found so many typos I couldn't even count. It was a pain that often stopped me in the middle of some very intense scenes- and if someone had never read the book - it may have caused some confusion as to meaning or even what what going on.",2010-09-20T17:42:45.000+00:00

Xavean,1,I wouldn't recommend purchasing !!!,"First off let me say this was a really good book.  However, the reason i say I wouldn't recommend purchasing this series is that this series is not and doesn't appear that it will ever be finished.  I hadn't read any of George R. Martin's works.  So I found books one thru three of this series very enjoyable however the fourth went severly downhill.  Then i find out that the next book has not been completed and it's been over five years since the last book was released.  This is a very complex story with Characters two many to count, and while it is an enjoyable story, without an ending to this tale in sight I would recommend reading something else until such time if it ever comes that the Author decides to complete this series.  It's too complex a story line to dive into just to be left hanging in the end.",2010-09-08T14:30:55.000+00:00
thetellittruetoyoujew,5,best series ever!!!,"a game of thrones will transport the reader into a world of wonder, magic, mystery, and warfare. it will seize hold of you the moment you start reading it and never let go. the charachters are not your typical cliche charachters you see in every other fantasy book where the bad guys are demons or dysfigured monsters, they are real people who's every action and choice are done for a reason, for the purpose of outsmarting or outmanuevering the enemy. the characters feel real and Martin's writing ability is absolutely stunning. the charachters in this series are the most fascinating you will ever read. the ""song of ice and fire"" is so good that when youre done reading it every other book you will ever read will come up short in its quest to capture your interest, your heart, and your mind, they will all just seem feeble compared to the ""song"".never before has a book brought chills to my spine at the mention of words, or a lump in my throat while reading an intense chapter. just when you think this book cant get any better, it will and with quite a bang.ANYONE WHO DOESNT LIKE THIS SERIES IS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF HIS MIND AND HAS NO SENCE OF TASTE!! when you read this series you will sing and you will dance all of the songs and dances known to man until you arrive at the last most wonderful song of all ""the song of ice and fire"".",2010-09-08T03:29:05.000+00:00

GloveSlipper,4,A great Book and Series but dont read if you suffer from depression.,"Let me first state that I love this series. These books are wonderful for escaping on a snowy night. The characters, good or bad, continue to forge a place in your heart. The books have everything you would want from a work of fiction, except.

This series is sad. Without any specific spoilers I can say that there is not one thing that has happened in this series that makes you feel good. Even when a character falls in love there is an underlying issue that makes the love a bad idea. The characters you care about are put through one horrific event after another and most of the characters are children. I know the series is far from finished but at this point, every single chapter you can rest assured that the characters you love will have nothing good happen to them. 

Read this series but take a break in between books. There is no rush as the author has very little interest in finishing the series quickly. Otherwise, the chapters begin to feel like a depressing grind.",2010-08-03T15:55:25.000+00:00

Park99,5,Incredible storyteller,"I read that HBO was turning Game of Thrones into a miniseries, so I figured I would the book before watching the show. I have read other fantasy series before, but George Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series blows them all away. Martin has created another world where medieval knights battle and dragons are reborn from legend. Over the series, the Seven Kingdoms are torn apart by war and a battle for the crown. The main story focuses on the Stark family, rulers in the North of the Seven Kingdoms. Eddard Stark, as honest a Lord as they come, is forced to play the Game of Thrones against the sinister Lannister family. Each of the Stark children, including his bastard son Jon Snow, must face the realities of war. While there are touches of magic in the story, most of the focus is on real human beings with no special powers except for prowess with a sword. This series in incredibly detailed, and the story races from one end of the world to the other. The genius in Martin's storytelling is his ability to take the reader inside the minds of all his characters - good and bad. Each chapter of the book is from a different characters point of view. While there are clear heroes and villains, Martin's ability to paint many characters in gray instead of just black and white in vivid detail is what makes the story so captivating to me. Each book in the series is very lenghty, and there are more books to come, but you will find yourself wishing the book was 2,000 instead of 1,000 pages long. On another note, I also find his take on the female characters very refreshing. Most fantasy series focus on only a strong ""chosen one"" male character, but Martin gives us female heroes as well.",2010-07-31T18:25:32.000+00:00

BigBookWorm,5,My New Favorite Series,I dont even know where to start....First off this is one of the best books I have ever read!  If you like Lord of the Rings or anything fantasy similar to that then you will absolutely love the book.  This book contains many different characters and each one offers various outlooks into this new land...The chapters are split up into several of the main characters point of view and really keeps the book interesting which in my opinion makes it even better the LotR.  The story is fantastic and this first book leaves you with so many questions you literally wont be able to wait to read the next one.,2010-07-12T18:50:37.000+00:00

Andrak,5,Masterpiece!,"These books are not written for those that enjoy light reading.

George takes us to a very believable world - amazing in scope - and introduces us to characters that are not only loveable, but some that are ruthlessly brutal. These books are raw; do not get attached to the characters! The enjoyment here is in the journey. if you let yourself escape into the world he's created, you will appreciate this series more. Please be patient, as things eventually work themselves out to their conclusion. (not always the conclusions the reader would envision) My only disappointment (and not with this book, but with the series) is that ""A Feast for Crows"" splits the narrative in half and you are left to wait for the fifth book to see what's happening to the other half of the characters. On top of this, George doesn't seem to be in any hurry to get the next book out, as it was originally slated to be out in December, 2009. A Song of Ice and Fire is/was slated to be a 7 part series, but at the pace at which they are being churned out, George may be too old and feeble to complete the series . . .

The first three books in this series are nothing short of awesome - ""Crows"" falls short, but it's mostly because of the split narrative. I have a feeling, however, that the fifth book will be well worth the wait!",2010-06-22T14:48:46.000+00:00

Elantraboi,4,I wasn't sure I was going to like this one.,"While I am fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I had never read anything by George R.R. Martin.  I was scolded for this oversight by many of co-workers and friends.  I finally gave in this past month and have been converted to a fan.

Be warned, ""A Game of Thrones"" is not for the casual fantasy reader.  It is deeply intricate and rich.  While Martin focuses each of the chapters on roughly ten main characters, there are well over fifty full realized characters in just the first book of this series.  It would be very easy to get confused or frustrated in the early pages of the tome, but to do so would be to lose out on the epic second half of the book.  Up until the last one hundred pages, I was still on the fence about this ""game of thrones.""  Now, having finsihed it, I can't wait to move on to the next book.

As a standalone book, I would not reccomend it; as the beginning of an epic series, I am totally hooked.",2010-06-14T20:14:53.000+00:00

,4,One Great Book!,"I like to give both the positive and negative of any book so that if I recommend it the person knows, even if it's just one persons opinion. I believe this book is one I would recommend to anyone who wants an in depth book that leads to an in depth series. I enjoyed each character or at the very least enjoyed how they related to the overall story. This first book is very dynamic and there is an unraveling of plots that exist in so many parts of the book and if not for the fact this was a fantasy book it could mirror life. I enjoy the details very much and the very real human condition of the characters and what they each have to go through. 
The down side: Like many popular authors, the use of words that are not written in common usage drives me crazy, for example Ser and not Sir to point out just one. I have no idea why authors do this and it hearkens to some old English word that is no longer used. Having said that, this is my only real complaint and the reader does get use to them.

agilescout,5,This is the fantasy fiction I've been looking for!,I want to be a fan of fantasy. I try to be. But I often find the writing inaccessible and sometimes sexist. But my husband and I started reading this book and have not been able to leave off reading this series since. The story is epic without being cumbersome. The story envelops. The characters are compelling. It is perfection. Now I just need to find more authors like Martin and I will be a very happy reader.,2010-06-01T19:11:25.000+00:00

,5,Better than Wheel of Time,"I've considered myself pretty loyal to Robert Jordan and his ""Wheel of Time"" series, but I have to admit I like this one better! It is similar to other epic fantasy books, but it doesn't have the endless descriptions and drag on-ness of WoT. The chapters bounce from character to character, but each is titled with the character's name so you recall the previous storyline. With WoT, that was nearly impossible for me and I was lost for a lot of the series. The only downfall is that the series is not finished yet and fans have been waiting a few YEARS for book 5....and there's no news of its progress on the author's website (at least, not since 08...)",2010-04-20T19:30:00.000+00:00
Kave,5,A Fantasy Canon,"As reluctant as I was to delve into yet another Sword and Sorcery saga, I am enthralled to have taken the chance on Martin's magnum opus. Immediately the characters take on a visceral shape, from the shaky acceptance surrounding the royal bastard John Snow to the abusive sibling relationship of the last remaining Targaryens, and the reader is swept into A Game of Throne's events alongside its characters. Revealed within the various POVs are an ambiguous blend of strengths and flaws that provide sympathy for even the more loathsome creations. It quickly becomes apparent that no one is safe within Martin's novel, as the most beloved players can be swept away following the turn of a page, and there are moments when the anticipation of a climax demands further reading.

While Martin can be long-winded in his descriptions, the aesthetics and world-building work to evolve Westeros into a rich universe of hope and tragedy. The wealth of research and knowledge that Martin has accrued toward medieval customs and times greatly shadows previous attempts at the tale of the knight and the king. Westeros therein becomes a gritty world composed on shaky ground, one in which the people within are tasked with overcoming challenges and betrayals, and a single decision can affect thousands. George R.R. Martin has cemented his place as a modern storyteller with A Game of Thrones, as the book sets a pace that does not slow down until the fourth book in the series.",2010-04-20T16:29:58.000+00:00

If you are looking a book full of romance, this is not that book. The author does a great job of keeping the plot realistic for a medieval setting. This book has a touch of fantasy in it that brings out the mystery that much more. If you are a fan of Dune or of Ender's Game, then this book is a must read. The only bad thing about the series is that there are currently 4 finished out of a total 7 planned, and the author seems to be taking his time with the rest.",2010-04-09T20:44:53.000+00:00

VisualO,5,All absorbing!,"I accidentally read the fourth book in the series first, based on a magazine recommendation. I had no idea what was going on, but even so, the story telling was riveting. I couldn't wait to see what happened to each character. So after finishing that book, I searched out this first one in the series. Such a rich history, great weaving of plot lines. There was a little too much talk of foods served and armament detail, which kind of drags down the writing-I wished the author could get to the action already! Switching back and forth between characters as protagonist helped me in seeing the story from the ""villian's"" point of view, a nice twist. I switched allegiances amost as many times as the lords and mercenaries in the book! Unbelievably imaginative and yet insightful when looking into the scheming hearts and actions of so many would-be rulers.",2010-03-12T16:56:13.000+00:00

SV16,5,Mind-blowing read!,"I am a huge LOTR fan, and my only problem with that series was how difficult it would get when you tried remembering the names of people and places.  At points in LOTR, Tolkein would also digress at a leisurely pace and the books would slow down.
However, and at the risk of comparing this series to a masterful series like LOTR, I will say A Game of Thrones is much more fast-paced and has an amazing story!  
I bought it with much skepticism but I am blown away with the author's imagination, the fast-paced story-line and depth of characters.  Every character seems to have a negative and a positive personality, albeit some have one or the other to a greater degree thus making them heroes and villains.  I have now ordered all the other books in the series and am eagerly waiting for the HBO show to air.
Highly recommended read in the fantasy fiction/thriller category.",2010-03-10T22:31:06.000+00:00

Kopi_Ninja,5,"Incredibly impressed and awed by the realism of the story and characters despite their fantasy setting. Just when you think everything will get its fantasy ending, however, reality strikes back!","Martin's ability to take a world apart and make it seem like your own's past history is an incredible experience to read. His characters embody not just the defining characteristics of good and evil, but an exhausting spectrum of the almost devine to the vilest examples of immorality imaginable.

I knocked a few things in my review only because I am a realist... Let's face it, the new book art is horrid! The previous edition's painted scene was much more of a draw off the shelf, not to mention mucb more attractive sitting on your own!

The book is offbeat, but still follows the basics of map in the front, character houses in the rear. You might need to use these items about as much as you do with Tolkein however, making them much more than just an eyegrab or little bonus feature.

Romance? No not really...

As with most first books, you get a slow start. Give it a couple chapters and you will be torn between throwing it across the room in fury or turning the next page.

Great book for book clubs! Very fun to discuss and almost cultish when you find someone reading it or who has.

I would not gift this book to most. Tolkein level writing is not for everyone and I think only about half the very few people I have recommended the book to have seen it through to the end.",2010-02-01T21:44:49.000+00:00

I loved the story, the characters and the world they lived in. I was afraid for them in some chapters and cheered them on in others. I've given this book to many people and they too loved it. We read all the following books we could. I wish we could say we are still waiting for the next book with baited breath but we've given up. The most recent book wasn't very good and its been a long time since it came out. I guess the author bit off more than he could chew. That doesn't take  away from this book which can be read independently and is wonderful.",2010-01-17T01:15:30.000+00:00

Ibid,5,AMAZING,"Though at heart I am not a reader of fantasy (trend more towards history) GRRM's Song of Fire and Ice (A Game of Thrones being #1) is perhaps the greatest series in an over-loaded genre.  
The story, characters, and world (based off of England's era of knights and usurpers) are all original yet familiar enough to be completely engrossing.
A Game of Thrones is not only the perfect introduction to a series, the book itself stands alone as a masterpiece.
Not being a true diehard fantasy reader, I think what attracts me so much to GRRM is that the book reads more like an historical novel than a fantasy novel.  Magic and all the usual things found in the genre are either non existent or far downplayed enough to actually feel plausible.",2010-01-15T14:48:32.000+00:00

dygunraider,3,More Like a Game of Feelings!,"I had heard much about George R R Martin's so called masterpiece, so does it make the cut? well at 800+ pages its a long book does that make it bad?
no but here is what does. First off this book is not recommended for children like at all, I personally feel it should come with a warning as
there is a large amount of suggestive content, so that might cut down on the appeal for some. Now the characters are top notch everyone feels like 
a living breathing person,if your a fan of characters that say one thing then do another this is your book. The writing also is top notch right now
I cant even think of a book where the writing is comparable. 
The only reason I didnt give it a higher rating is because evil seems to dominate good almost the whole way through for every good victory there seems to be three evil ones.
That being said hardcore fantasy fans will definately love this book.
And I think it will become one for the ages.",2010-01-11T18:42:46.000+00:00

ddvx13,5,"An excellent series; Don't listen to the previous posters comment, he doesn't know what he's talking about!","First off, do not listen to the previous poster.  The 5th and final book of the series?  CLEARLY HE DOESN'T KNOW THIS SERIES AT ALL.  One, it is now a 7 part series.  Secondly, the next book (5) takes place during the 4th book.  He had to split the it apart because he has so many characters and plot lines twisting with each other.

Now, going onto the review, instead of the previous poster bashing.  This was recommended to me by a friend as the best fantasy series he had ever read.  I can say without much hesitation that this is one of the best fantasies every written.  BUT it depends on what type of fantasy you like.  If you're one of those mythical creatures type fantasy readers--this isn't for you.  If you like fantasies with some hero saving a damsel in distress--this series isn't for you.  If you like blood, guts, good old fashion middle-ages killing--then read on.  This is by far, the nittiest, grittiest series out there--that still maintains a story line.

Speaking of the story line--it does take quite a while to get used to it.  Martin's style is very different from most writers, and if you have read the other reviews you'll see that I'm not lying.  When I first started reading book 1, I almost put it down and stopped reading.  After about, 200 pages, you start to get a good feel for this world.  After the first book, you'll start to understand the plot (or perhaps I'm just a little slow.)  That being said, it was completely worth it.  

The characters...  Are so completely messed up it is insane.  Good and evil cease to really exist.  The motivations of the characters move beyond good and evil, into the realm of chaos.  The one thing you can say about Martin, is that you cannot predict how his characters will act, or what he will do with them.  I guarantee you, at one point in this series, if you read it, will put down the book and string off a line of expletives that will leave people around you wondering if you're sane.

Overall, if you're a fantasy reader, you need to have this series on your bookshelf.",2009-09-26T19:55:01.000+00:00
JohnHamillLindenhurstNY,1,don't buy this book!!!!!!!,"This clown refuses to finish the 5th and final book of the series.

Salieri,4,An Overall Great Fantasy Adventure,"Mr. Martin does a great job introducing and personifying his characters and sets up the plot elements with startling proficiency. The only criticism I have for the author's style is that George R.R. Martin jumps around from character to character in each chapter which can become a negative distraction for the reader. As well, he could have easily cut out 33 percent of the book and withheld the same substance and effect. With the book totaling to almost a thousand pages, it sometimes seems repetitive and sedentary. But overall, a book that deserves to be on any fantasy reader's shelf.",2009-08-07T23:52:34.000+00:00

DAY-READER,5,Master Piece,"I have to say something about the negative response that one person said about rape, murder, evil and such. Thats just simply what happen during that time era. The world Martin describes is so real and vivid. I love the characters and how he develops them. it's fascinating to watch them grow and experience the horrors of life. This entire series gripped me and it never let go. I have been patiently waiting for ""A Dance With Dragons""........if your looking for real-time fantasy without stupid magic and dull characters that are so cliche in fantasy, I mean every fantasy book out thier is almost a copy of some sort, but Martin makes this series so real and different from the normal hero's and villians type. Once you finish reading you will then know that you read something entertaining and different then most fantasy you have read.....George R.R Martin has risen to the top of the fantasy world and is my favorite author...If your wanting something to read while waiting for a dance with dragons i suggest you read the Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks.....",2009-08-01T03:08:02.000+00:00

DearReader,5,"Atypically for this genre, I really loved this book and the series","When browsing the racks I have never, ever, voluntarily picked up any book that (judging by it's cover, *sigh*) smacks of pelt-wearing, sword fighting, pseudo-Renaissance-festivally antics. 

However, a friend recommended it to me whose judgement has been proven reliable, so I looked at the read-it-now pages on Amazon. I was apparently in the right frame of mind to be receptive or maybe was just bored at work, but, I ordered it. 

After reading the first (A Game of Thrones) I couldn't WAIT to get delivery of the second, and after that one, I was amped to get the third. 

A Game of Thrones and the next two volumes are great stories, and told entirely without the sentimental, overwrought clap trap one can encounter in other titles in the genre. In fact Martin doesn't spare any character from any outcome, no matter how beloved or seemingly intrinsic to the plot. 

If you need some escapist fiction, and are okay with encountering violence -- such as someone getting run through with a sword -- every chapter or two, then this is a great book to pick up.",2009-07-15T03:02:02.000+00:00

Sutinike,5,Martin is a master of historifantasy!,"Martin has created a masterpiece with this series.

Never have I read any novel of any genre with so many characters, all so brilliantly lifelike, believable and richly detailed. He doesn't introduce them too quickly, giving the reader time to get to know and love them, and as soon as a side is chosen, he takes us into the world of the opposing characters, and we come to love them equally!

The scope of the series is truly epic, and while this is technically fantasy, the reader may forget that it's not historical fiction! The style is so gritty and unforgiving that one has no choice but to believe. The fantastical elements creep in slowly and undeniably - a skeleton in a closet, terrifying and mostly unseen.

With character drama like this, you don't have to be a fantasy buff to love this series. All who like sweeping drama will enjoy this fantastic journey.",2009-05-09T15:46:15.000+00:00

Fonda,5,A Game of Thrones,"A Game of Thrones is the first book in a seven book series called A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.  A Game of Thrones is based in a fantasy world called the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, which is very much like Medieval Europe.  The Seven Kingdoms have been united under one rule for the last 500 years ever sense Aegeon The Conquerer united the land.  After a brutal civil war against the ""Mad King"" the land has known peace with the New King (Robert).  However, this is all about to change if the King's best friend Ned Stark can't figure out why or who wanted King Robert's friend and ""Hand"" Jon Arryn dead.  With Jon Arryn dead Robert places his loyal friend Ned Stark as his Hand, which has the authority of the King. But if Ned can't learn how to play The Game of Thrones then his term as Hand may become a short one. 

   In the East decendents of the Mad King still remain and are trying to form their army once again to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms like their ancestor Aegeon the Conqueror 500 years earlier.  

   And far in the North there is a Wall.  Built to protect all of the 7 Kingdoms it has been undermanned with rapers, robbers, and thieves.  The wall is accustomed to losing men, but when one of their scouting party never returns they must find out what is happening and if the wildlings are the cause of it all.  

   A Game of Thrones is told through the eyes of 9 characters.  Enabling the reader to see the point of view of all the sides of the conflict.  This is the first series that I have read that does this and I absolutely love it.  Being able to see all the viewpoints of the conflicts in the story is very interesting.  Martin also does a very good job in suprising the reader.  With just changes in your mindset on a specific character who you thought you knew or simply with what you know to be ""fact.""  I GUARANTEE that you will NOT be able to predict the ending of A Game of Thrones or any of the others.  Finally, I believe that this is the best series out there today and everyone that is a fan of fantasy, mystery, or just reading a well written story should buy!  

***CAUTION*** If you do not like a book with a lot of characters or one where the story is continous from book to book.  Then this series may not be for you.",2009-03-13T03:50:11.000+00:00

KRUCK,5,A Game of Thrones INDEED!!!,An excellent read that keeps you entertained throughtout the whole book. I can't really say I was bored with the story at any point. I like how it switches from character to character each chapter and you get to know all the main characters on an individual basis. The plot is intriguing and at the end left me ready for the next book because the story could go so many ways and there are so many different things going on that it makes it more vast and complex which makes it all the more interesting. I enjoyed the first book in this saga and am excited to read the rest!,2008-12-10T08:05:53.000+00:00

Infinite_Day,5,A good start to the series,"This is one of the best fantasy series I have read to date. If you like epic fantasy with raw grit that can make you feel like it's real then you should get A Game of Thrones. Martin has an uncanny ability to craft characters with an astounding level of realism. I guarantee you will find yourself sympathizing with at least one character of this enthralling work. The plot teases you with what is to come in the later books as well. Martin's ability to pen equally enveloping scenery rounds out this beginning entry to the series. A Song of Ice and Fire will grab you and pull you into it's world and you won't want to leave. The only unfortunate part is that you will likely be caught up to the current installment in the series before the next title is released. Don't expect a Forgotten Realms series pace of each book in a series being released within a year of the last. I have been waiting years for A Dance of Dragons and, unfortunately, the only updates you will get from Martin's web-site lately are those of the current weeks' NFL games. Never-the-less, this series is certainly worth the read.",2008-11-19T20:15:44.000+00:00

Iain010100,5,"Rich, Intelligent, Real","""Game of Thrones"" is the first of George R. R. Martin's ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series, and my review here applies to books 1 through 5, all the ones available at the time of this writing. Martin's books have intelligent characters with real personalities, weaknesses, regrets, nobility and failings. The simpleminded, two-dimensional heroes and villains of too many stories in this genre don't exist. The environments he creates are not the mystical worlds of magic and wizards, but rather real places with where dragons, wizards, and mystical woodland folk exist mainly in legends of the past, and set the stage for things to come. Magic is subtle and scarce, and so much more interesting because of it. The language is complex and captivating without being overly descriptive and tedious (for the most part), but be aware that it is for adults and contains adult themes. With more than 1000 pages per book with small type, you certainly get your money's worth. It took about a month to read one of these where at the same reading pace took me about a week to get through a Harry Potter book.",2008-10-13T13:24:12.000+00:00
