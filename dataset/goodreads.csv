Rebecca,5,,"Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""","Dec 06, 2008"
Bill Kerwin,2,,"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye.""","Jun 24, 2013"
Trevor (I sometimes get notified of comments),5,,"I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.","Jan 03, 2009"
Allie,4,,"Didn't exactly read this book - Joe and I listened to it in the car on the way home from visiting family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, and was very fascinated by certain parts of it, especially the sections about the Beatles, computer programmers and Korean co-pilots.","Dec 29, 2008"
Steve,2,,"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas.","Dec 16, 2008"
David,3,,"Malcolm Gladwell's new book reads like a series of cocktail-party anecdotes. Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:","Nov 14, 2008"
Eric,3,,"I can save you the trouble of reading the book: smart people don't automatically become successful, they do so because they got lucky. This rule applies to everyone including the likes of Bill Gates and Robert Oppenheimer. That's it. That's what the whole book is about. Gladwell looks at case after case of this: Canadian hockey players, Korean airline pilots, poor kids in the Bronx, Jewish lawyers, etc... Even with all this evidence it feels like he's pulling in examples that fit his theory and","Dec 19, 2008"

David,1,,"Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along","Sep 10, 2011"
Adam,5,,People are criticizing this book because it is not a journal article. Well guess what: we're not all sociologists. I have read plenty of journal articles in my own field (law). I'm in no position to read journal articles in fields outside my own. Having a well-written piece of mass-market writing is just the thing I need to access this information.,"Dec 30, 2008"

Anirudh,4,,"Ever wondered why Bill Gates is so rich? Or why the Beatles is considered to be a ""once in a millennium"" band? (or why people find ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" to be so trippy, lol) Or simply, why some people are so outrageously successful while others wallow in mediocrity?","Jun 02, 2021"

Julie,5,,"In just one week, this book transformed a relatively normal woman into someone who's been saying, ""Well, in this book I'm reading. . . you know, Outliers? Yeah, there's this section on. . . there's this part about. . . You should read this chapter. . . No, no, just wait here and let me read these 3 pages out loud for you. . . Have you read it? Oh, you haven't? Let me just show you this one page, it'll just take a minute!""","Jan 09, 2014"
Siddharth,4,,"""If only I'd read this book earlier,"" the old man sighed. He shook his head sadly. ""I was at the wrong end of the cut-off age. I'd have made a champion swimmer..."". His voice trailed off.","Jan 12, 2013"
Claudia,4,,"""Outliers"" those wildly successful people, for whom 'normal rules don't apply.' Are they just lucky, talented? Maybe...but, outliers may not be outliers after all...after reading the entire book, I was slapped by that at the very end. Gladwell looks closely at success, and those who seem to have waltzed into incredible success...Canadian hockey players, who just happened to have been born in the right month of the year; Bill Gates, who just happened to go to a school where the PTA moms bought a","Jan 19, 2009"

Monica,3,,"I don't know about Malcolm Gladwell. I've read 3 of his books. All of them fine, but nothing special. All of them fairly superficial with nothing original or innovative. I think his books are very pop culture and should be read in the time frame (say within a year) that they are published. Too long after that and they become stale, not prolific or prescient. Gladwell is a very good and interesting writer, but I don't think his books have much depth or staying power.","Dec 01, 2018"
Hamad,3,,✍️,"Dec 07, 2020"
Alan,3,,"This one is a weird one for me to write, and I’ll explain why. Without being unnecessarily reductionist, I used to think that there were two types of reactions to Malcolm Gladwell: you either hate him or love him. This was an opinion informed by my own experiences, having finished an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and psychology (an area Gladwell lives and breathes in). Graduate students, professors, and my own peers would be quick to talk up or talk down Gladwell upon hearing the name of","Jun 26, 2021"

Kressel Housman,5,,"This has got to be Malcolm Gladwell’s best book yet, and coming from a fan like me, that’s saying something!","Dec 11, 2008"
Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship,2,,"This is one of those books that give popular nonfiction a bad name. Which is unfortunate, because what could be better than books that both educate and entertain? But Outliers embodies everything that people who sneer at the genre are talking about: its conclusions are both obvious and simplistic, its writing persuasive but glib. It’s easy to see why Gladwell is a popular author: he’s a good storyteller, his writing accessible and entertaining. But this book is so riddled with oversimplified con","Jul 21, 2019"
Riku Sayuj,5,,My first exposure to Gladwell. SO was more or les blown away by the ideas. Have grown more conservative in acceptance of his views as I have grown familiar with his topics through other books. But still an eminently quotable book.,"Jul 14, 2011"
Tatevik is on semi hiatus (trying to finish PHD),5,,"This is officially the best book of 2019. Damn it, this is the most valuable book I've ever read (Maybe I am still in a hangover, can't be sure).","Dec 28, 2019"
