                    "ReviewText": "Mr. Gladwell, Your book Outliers: The Story of Success was a very good read and it provided me with a new perspective on a topic that is widely referenced. Everyone has heard about the stories where someone goes from rags to riches, but you completely changed the way people think about success stories. Many people believe that it takes only pure ambition and talent to be successful, but you realized that there is way more to it than that. In \"The Trouble with Geniuses, Part II\", you showed that having a higher intelligence than someone else does not increase your chances of being successful. Being in school it is hard to understand how being naturally intelligent does not help because all of the awards and accolades are given to the smartest and strongest. However, the example of Langan and Oppenheimer showed me how some outliers in these award ceremonies came to be successful because they have charisma that others do not possess. Many people overlook these seemingly obvious occurrences, but your ability to convey this method has forever changed my opinion about success. In the class that we read this book in, we have an essential question, which is \"To what extent do time and place define a person?\" The goal of this essential question is to help us make connections to the things that we do in class and I can honestly say that Outliers provides the best answer to this question. Throughout every chapter you showed a new and different way to explain how success is a result of where someone is at, with two of the best examples found in \"The Matthew Effect\" and \"The 10,000-Hour Rule.\" The importance of birthdays as they pertain to sports had never once crossed my mind, but knowledge that I gained from reading your explanation in \"The Matthew Effect\" shows how much they affect success. The fact that some players will be naturally more mature based on cut off dates for specific sports seems unfair, but just proves the point that sometimes success comes from a little luck and opportunity. This chapter caught my attention because growing up I played a lot of sports and now I wonder to what extent did my birthday play in determining how successful I was. In \"The 10,000-Hour Rule\" you discussed two things that I love those being computer programming and the Beatles. This chapter contained the same theme of being born at the right time by discussing how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were in the perfect age range for when society began to become more technological, but it also showed how where someone is located affects success. Given that Bill Joy and Bill Gates were located near some of the few advanced computer terminals of the time and the Beatles were given long stints in a club in Germany, it is no surprise that they were able to succeed because along with their natural talent they were given opportunities to practice in places that allowed them to perfect their craft. Overall I feel like this book was one of the most interesting and thought provoking books that I have ever read. The amount of research that you had to put into this book is incredible given some of the hidden messages that you have found in a variety of things like why a group of people are lawyers at the same time. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that you put into this book because it really did change the way that I look at things. Sincerely, Ryan Crim",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Malcome Gladwell, \n\nI am currently a senior at Hatboro Horsham High School, and for English class we were assigned to read your book, it was actually our first assignment. See this course is structured around one essential question: In what ways do place and time impact a person? So the theme of your book fit in quite well. Our class discusses a bit more then just what impacts success, but the examples in the book were intriguing.\nPersonally my favorite chapter was chapter nine, Maritas Bargain.  This story really inspired me. I think it's safe to say that everyone in the world has the desire to be successful at something; it could be big or small. But not everyone is willing to work hard in order to achieve success. The level of commitment and hard work this little girl puts in on a day to day basis is magnificent. It made me reevaluate how much effort I put into my daily activities, and made me want to work harder. \nChapter two was another one of my favorites. Before I even read the book I'd heard about the 10,000 hour rule and the idea made a lot of sense to me. I believe that practice really does make perfect. I don't think anyone can get truly good at something without putting in hours of hard work. Sometimes when I look back I wish that I had spent a little more time practicing things, like soccer or drawling. Who knows how good I might be right now if I had spent 10,000 hours practicing. But then again maybe I'm accumulating hours for something that is not quite as ordinary, and I don't even realize. \nLastly there was chapter three, the trouble with geniuses. This wasn't one of my favorite chapters, but I do think many of the points you made were fascinating. When I think of the stereotypical vision in my head for someone who is successful I automatically think of someone who is incredibly smart.  But being smart isn't everything, and I agree with the fact that there are different kinds of smart. I believe creativity is also important to becoming successful. And for that reason I am thankful that I have a creative side. Even though I'm only in high school I have seen this in action. A lot of the things we do in school require a basic knowledge, but what really makes one students work stand out from another's is their creativity. And frankly sometimes the smartest person in the group isn't the one who ends up doing well. \nI hope one day I will be an outlier; that my success will make me standout from the crowd. And when I look back and remember reading your book I can apply some of the points you made to my own success. So thank you for writing such a fascinating book and if you read this thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to my opinions, and I hope to read some of your other books in my future because I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",

                    "ReviewText": "Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was a very interesting read. I did not know what to expect when I first picked it up.  I saw that that it said it was the \"story of success\" and was very intrigued in how Gladwell would approach this topic.  The first chapter really made my head spin and convinced me that Gladwell knew what he was talking about.  It truly made me retrace my steps growing up and thinking about how I was raised and how I could have been raised differently (not that I would want to be at all).  Gladwell harks on the idea that when you were born is most important to your success but there were flaws right away in that this was not consistent with things outside of sports or in America. I do not believe that his philosophy on who were the faces of the Industrial Revolution of America was valid at all.  Throughout the book Gladwell seems to continually look past the hard work of many and instead replace it with fate and environment which is not fair to those who worked hard for what they have.  Gladwell also dismisses those who are successful in their lives that have not gone through the \"10,000 Hour Rule\".  In that chapter Gladwell describes only people who have experienced financial success therefore it is very opinionated to what success is in Gladwell's mind.  An example of success that is not financial is Mother Theresa who helped thousands throughout her life and devoted her life to the success of others.  She may have worked at what she did for 10,000 hours but experienced an entirely different type of success.  Altogether, there are far too many loopholes in Gladwell's work and he is too quick to dismiss success of people who do not fit into his pigeonhole.  I would give this book three stars out of five because although it is biased, Gladwell still makes points about stories that are true and interesting to think about but most, such as Bill Gates, are one in a million and a special case.",

                    "ReviewText": "\"Outliers\" has directly related to my essential question for my senior English course. In my class our essential question is \"To what extent do time and place define a person\". The purpose of our essential question is for us to take a close look on the things around us and realize the importance of time and place. In your book this question is answered in almost every chapter. In the epilogue you tell us about the story of your mother and how she became successful. The events in her life directly related to our question because without the men and women who influenced the scholarships for Jamaican children in that time period you mother might have not been able to attend college. The epilogue for me was one of the best chapters because of the way the story was told and how well the chapter was structured to explain every facture that influenced and defined how your mother came to be successful. I also believe that chapter 6 on Harlan, Kentucky was a very intriguing chapter. The information in the chapter made me look at cultures within the United States differently, in a more understanding way. Also it made me realize that many of my southern relatives had the culture of honor. Also I found the 10,000 hours chapter a fascinating chapter. I liked how you showed many different successful people in totally different occupations, and how those people were living examples of the 10,000 hour rule. One of my favorite parts in that chapter was when you went into detail about the Beatles success story. I enjoyed this because the music industry now days it doesn't required a lot of practice to get acknowledged, but to do what the Beatles did takes an overwhelming amount of talent and I personally wish that many of the other artist out there would learn from the Beatles story and see that hard work and practice pays of rather than using technology to improve your music. Overall Mr. Gladwell I just would like to say that this book is amazing book and that it is one of my favorites. Each page of the book kept me attentive and made me want to continue reading to absorb more and more information about the people around us. Thank you very much for writing this book Mr. Gladwell.",

However, there is a tendency to feel mildly disheartened by the theme of the necessity of opportunities and the large rejection of the idea of \"The American dream.\" This happens largely in the first part of the book: \"Opportunity\". The first chapter discusses the accumulation of opportunities as a result of each other starting with something as simple as birthdate. The second half discusses the effect of a legacy set before us that is unchangeable and again could decide our future despite our having no control over it. Gladwell's method of mixing story telling with analysis and facts is impressive and keeps the book interesting, but the occasion undertone of condescension can be distracting. Having read his other book The Tipping Point and enjoying it greatly I was a little disappointed by Outliers, but nonetheless found Gladwell's ideas interesting despite feeling slightly depressed by it.",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Mr. Gladwell,\nAfter reading your terrific book \"Outliers\" I wanted to talk about some of the topics discussed in the book.  Overall, the book had some very strong connections showing how time and place affect a person's success. (This therefore makes them outliers)  How time and place affect a person is my English IV class' essential question.  The essential question's purpose is to offer connections between many different texts and show how they can all relate to one another.  Many topics you have made in your book, such as Jewish lawyers, geniuses and plane crashes all relate back to our essential question.\n\tThe Three Lessons of Joe Flom was a very informative chapter.  I found it to be a good example of karma because the Jews were given negligible law cases in the 1950's, but when those cases turned out to be valuable, the Jews were experts at them.  Time is a defining element of success throughout your book.  For example, I agree with your insight about Mort Janklow and how he was given the opportunity to succeed because of when he was born. (In comparison with his Father)  A question comes to mind after reading this chapter.  Are there any advantages to being born in 1992?  This is when I was born and I wonder if there are any built in advantages here.  \n\tThe Trouble with Geniuses Part II is equally an interesting chapter.  I have always wondered how much IQ has to do with how smart a person really is.  You have cleared up the question and I have learned more about IQ then I have ever known before.  I agree with your comparison of Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer.  Langan lacks social skills and practical sense, while still being a genius.  Oppenheimer had the social skills and was a genius, which allowed him to be innovative and extremely successful in his career.  I question why Chris Langan was not as successful.  Many people have weak social skills and a much lower IQ and are still successful.  With his IQ, I would imagine he could easily overcome his inadequacies.  \n\tThe Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes was probably the most interesting chapter I read in your book.  It was stunning to see that there is actually a difference between cultures that could actually lead up to something catastrophic, such as a plane crash.  After reading about index power ratings and other information, I totally understand how differences in place could affect how one interprets their language.  Do you think there is any where else we could apply this index rating?  If so I would love to hear about it because I think it could really help understand the differences that time and place have on society.\n\tThis book has helped me think about why I am who I am.  There is so much more to think about that you have helped me to unlock.  Maybe I could be better at math if I was Asian.  Maybe I have a culture of honor engraved in me and I just don't know it.  Many of your topics relate to my life and I question really why things happen.  I now know what it means to be an outlier and how the outliers truely got to where they are.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn S.",

                    "ReviewText": "In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, Mr. Gladwell explains various different situations and stories of success that have happened in the past millenium. This book reminded me of the many success stories that happen in people's lives, and provided some background about how these people became successful. Throughout the novel, Gladwell stresses one of his major points which was \"The Matthew effect\" which explained being born in the right time and place. He talks about Canadian hockey players that have a birthday between January- March usually end up being the most successful out of the players that are born in that year. I don't think that being born in a specific month then it has being born in another month. A person born in January and a person born in September can both be equally successful even if a person was born earlier. While some good players are born in these months, he does not give a clear explanation on the certain variables that causes the early-born athletes to perform better. Another one of his points that Gladwell explains in this novel was the \"10,000 hour rule\". I have always heard of the phrase \"practice makes perfect\", and was curious as to how Gladwell would have explained it. He states that in order to be a professional, you must spend at least 10,000 hours practicing and polishing your art. He gives many famous examples of professionals who have followed this rule and become professionals. I just found it intriguing that such successful people such as Bill Gates and The Beatles followed this rule to be successful. I was always curious to see how Bill Gates became one of the most successful CEOs in the world and Gladwell explained about the dedication and work ethic that he had in order to succeed. One example is the famous rock band The Beatles. The Beatles's story about how they constantly practiced and played their gigs for many hours a day, and thrived as musical prodigies for playing for about 10,000 hours. I was wondering if the way you deal with practice might have an effect on the 10,000 rule and becoming successful? After the chapter about the 10,000 rule, Gladwell elaborated on the story about Asians being good at math and their cultivating rice patties. He talks about how the Asians had ancestors who worked extremely long hours to absorb \"perseverance\" and \"tenacity\". They also have a language advantage, since certain Asian numbers are easier organized compared to other languages, and are easier to say. The Asian Math story actually intrigued me because people always stereotype Asians saying that they are always good at math. I never realized how Asian's language's numbers are much more simpler compared to the complex numbers of the languages and Gladwell helped clarify that. My parents who are heavily old fashioned and follow the Asian culture, I finally realize what they have been trying to get through to me all of these years. I could definitely relate to all of this, and now I seem to fully understand why Asians are superior at math and the explanation that patience is a virtue with the reference to the rice patties. After reading \"Outliers\", Gladwell helped clear up a couple misconceptions of success as well as provide some very detailed explanations on how famous people got to where they are today. I liked the many stories and examples that Gladwell used throughout the novel, and I hope that future generations can read about success through Gladwell's point of view.",

The only reason why I thought it was not his best book was because some of the examples got repetitive because they all concluded the point that there are little things, opportunities, or advantages that can make a big difference. At the same time, I thought many of his examples were interesting and sometimes even were things I could relate to. The Matthew Effect and having an earlier birth date to give more advantages is something that has affected my life. My birthday was the day before the cut off date to start school and I was always behind in math and reading for the first few years of elementary school. In addition, chapter four reminded me of how we all need to be well-rounded in order to be successful. Small things other than intelligence make a big difference in making that person more successful than another. I thought it was a great reminder to those people who are not the smartest ones out there. Overall, Outliers was a positive book to read. It can definitely show hope and advise young people such as high school students who may not be at the top of their class or think that they need the talents that everyone else has. The only negative to the book is that I thought it dragged on a little too much. This is why I give it a 4/5.",

Malcolm Gladwell explains all the insights of how the people we least expect become successful or unsuccessful. Just become someone is intelligent and has high IQ, does not mean they will always become the most productive. Timing, opportunities, culture, and practical intelligence also play into how successful a person may be turn out to be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not directed towards group. Anyone can read it and everyone should read this novel. I found it to be brilliant and useful in various ways. Overall, Gladwell wrote an excellent message through this novel.",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Mr. Gladwell, In my senior English class, one of the requirements was to complete your best seller, The Outliers. I found the topics discussed to be very interesting to me as a person, and to the way I analyze and think about everyday occurrences. I now can look at the things that go on in my life daily, such as driving to school, and think is there maybe an underlining purpose or reason as to why I do it. Your book has really opened my eyes to the many predictable parts of life I did not previously realize. As part of our course, we're asked to reflect on the question How did I get here\" along with other related questions. I feel your book has given me more of an idea of how I can't always control outcomes, and that it is not the situations you handle that predict the future, but rather the uncontrollable factors you can't see coming. You gave an example of NHL players and their birth dates in the beginning of the book I found especially intriguing. You mentioned how no matter the age or amount of exposure a player had, they were mostly all born in the early part of January. Your explanation of this was because the cutoff date is right after the New Year for most organizations, so these younger kids would get more playing time then people who missed the cut off date. This would allow them to play against kids in most cases that were older than them by year but not by ability. Because of this, amateur hockey leagues would pick up these players and develop them into today's hockey stars. It proves that in most cases, it is the things you can control that define you. You also brought up the Beatles and what impact their playing experience had on their ability to make it big. It was shown that they had been given an opportunity at a local bar to play 7 hour gigs many times throughout the week. It not only gave them the tools necessary to not be gun-shy when their time came, but it gave them those necessary 10,000 hours to perfect their craft. This is a message that particularly hit home with me, an aspiring musician. I realized at that point that the time I put in practicing my instrument and understanding music was not enough. If I wanted to actually be as close to perfecting an instrument or anything for that matter, I needed to put in close to 10, 000 hours practicing. As of right now, one to two hours a day just will not simply cut it, and I need to dedicate myself more in order to become the best I can be. Something's like the 10,000 hour theory are predictable and at some point obtainable. In music you are always trying to perfect your craft, so when you hear of something that is obtainable, you go for it. The last part of your book I wanted to bring to your attention and discuss with you was Chapter 7: the chapter that explained how many airplane accidents are based off of cultural differences. You made me realize that when cause of an accident is explained, it most likely not the case. It is in fact, normally a series of failures in communication, starting with pilot and co pilot communication. If you are to fly, you must set up the necessary lines of communication. One must make it clear that if there is a situation in which lives are at stake, the co pilot can correct the pilot. I think you provided readers with a valuable life lesson here, in basically saying, for any situation to prove positive, communication must be always open. I thoroughly enjoyed your book, and look to read other literature by you in the future!",

                    "ReviewText": "Outliers is by far one of the most interesting and unique books I have read, period. The content really makes you stop and analyze the world around you and how everyday occurrences we take for granted can be explained using raw data and statistics. As much as I would have enjoyed reading the book this book on my own, it was also a part of the curriculum for my Senior English class. In our class, almost everything we are learning about revolved around our essential question, which is \"To what extent do time and place define a person?\". You perpetually answer this question in every chapter of his book using many real world examples of people who have found success in their lives by basically being in the right place at the right time. Outliers is unique in the sense that it is unlike any book I have ever read, presenting the information in a factual fashion while leaving room for the reader's mind to wander about to the infinite possibilities that are possible in this world due to certain variables and opportunities presented to someone.\nChapter 3, entitled \" The Trouble With Geniuses Part I\" is one of the chapters that deals with one of the variables that a person can control, which is the 10,000 rule, in which a person must complete 10,000 hours of a certain activity to excel in it. Your real world examples really illustrate the effort necessary to be successful, and how it is one of the few things an individual can control. Chapter 4, \"The Trouble With Geniuses Part 2\", was my personal favorite because it really talks about how those who have the capability to succeed don't always do due to their environment or the opportunities that are presented to them. It made me realize that there is a large amount of luck involved with achieving greatness in any field of work. I also found the first chapter of the book interesting because I have a first-hand experience witnessing what the chapter talks about. Chapter 1 deals with elite Canadian hockey teams and the birthdates of the best players. Players who were born closer to January 1st, which is the birthday cut-off for hockey leagues, were always the biggest and most skilled in their respective leagues. I found this interesting because in my experiences playing hockey, I witnessed players who I both played with and against who were one of the best on their teams and happened to be born towards the beginning of the calendar year, you do a good job laying the foundation for the book in this chapter and proves how certain extenuating circumstances can be directly related to achieving your goals and being successful. \nAll in all, Outliers in its entirety is a fantastic read from start to finish, with every chapter giving a fresh and interesting behind-the-scenes look into what really happens when a person finds success in life. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for a new perspective into the world around us and everyday life.\n-Jimmy Salfiti",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Mr. Gladwell, In our Senior English class, the essential question we are analyzing is, \"To what extent does time and place define a person?\" We have been basing topics and ideas to revolve around this question and analyzing how it does define a person. Therefore, we read your novel, Outliers in which you explain how these factors impact one's success or one's failures through descriptive stories about real life people. Most of the examples portray how time and place can provide opportunities that can lead to a successful life, allowing them to become an \"outlier\". But I believed that three chapters stood out from the rest that seemed the most interesting. In the chapter, \"The 10,000 Hour Rule\", the fact that most professionals had practiced at least a total of 10,000 hours on their talent was fascinating. Practicing a total of 10,000 hours seemed to be the common theme in this chapter because all of the skilled people had that or more while the lesser lacked the same amount of practice. I also agree with this logic because it seems that many people may start out with a bit more of an advantage, but the dedication to strive to become better ultimately separates the skilled from the unskilled. I was also curious to know if there have been any exceptions to this rule, such as a professional pianist who has only had 7,000 hours of practice, but performs just as well as someone with 10,000 hours. Another chapter that was interesting was, \"The Trouble with Geniuses Part II\", which included two different geniuses that had opposite lives because of a skill required through one's environment called practical intelligence. You would expect any genius to master that skill, no matter the cause, but it was Oppenheimer who used this skill to manipulate a situation, while Langan could not. Also, I agree with the results of the study about the lives of wealthier families and poorer families and how it impacts their practical intelligence, because the wealthier parents seem to allow their children to be more independent. After reading Oppenheimer's story, I was curious to know what he said that was so persuasive that allowed him to be excused from jail. Lastly, the chapter, \"Three Lessons of Joe Flom\", was another interesting section about how time really presents opportunities. Flom's cases at the time were considered minor until businesses seized to control one another, which made his cases extremely important and current. Time seems to be the gateway that allowed Flom to become successful. I agree with your logic that some disadvantages could be one's opportunities for success, which is portrayed through the life of Joe Flom. Although, I do wonder if there are many others like Flom because his scenario seems rare. Furthermore, I also enjoyed reading the chapter, \"Rice Paddies and Math Test\", since it related to my own life. I've always viewed my math skills as excellent solely because I was Chinese, but now I understand that many factors contribute to this talent, such as the work ethic of my people. But, although I am Chinese, I do not use the Chinese language so the words are not quicker, which still does not allow me to understand why I am more advanced than others at this subject. Overall, I loved the way you described these situations and how they correlate with our essential question. Sincerely, David Dang",

                    "ReviewText": "Mr. Gladwell This semester in high school our class read your book, Outliers. At first, I thought this was another mundane English book that was part of our curriculum, but I was proved wrong. Outliers allowed me to see the world of success in a whole new perspective compared to what I saw before. In senior English, the course is designed around ourselves and our relation to the world. We explore diversity, religion, and even naming. Our central question of the course asks how time and place define an individual, and I think your book answers that question perfectly. The stories you talked about in the novel each have certain circumstances and problems which influence the development of the character in them, and it really shows how our successes and failures is determinant on not only our ability but also on our environment. To me, the most interesting chapter in your book is Rice Paddies and Math Tests, where you looked into how and why people of Asian descent have higher math scores throughout the world. It was really cool to see how cultural tendencies that are often overlooked can be influential in aspects like education, where usually people correlate ability with effort. I also like the chapter The 10,000 Hour Rule, where you showed how people who have become great in their respective fields have a commonality between them: Practice. Often when people think of the greats such as Bill Gates and The Beatles, they think that those individuals and groups have impeccable talent. But the 10,000 Hour Rule not only makes sense, it's a great way to get people motivated. As the saying goes, \"Practice makes perfect\". The idea that successful individuals have been given opportunities and have made the best of them is hope for us all in different situations. The only question I have about this book is in the chapter Marita's Bargain. I understood the idea that opportunities are the key to success, and that for the world to have more \"Outliers\", we need to get more opportunities to more people. My question is, how would you propose to do this? Do you think that the American education system is showing how its students can take advantage of the opportunities in their country? All in all, I really enjoyed reading Outliers. It was not another mundane English book to trudge through, but rather a stimulating, intellectual novel that built upon facts. I think that the lessons I learned in Outliers will stay with me for a long time to come.",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Mr. Gladwell,\n\tThroughout the last semester, my high school English class has been reading and discussing \"Outliers\". For every lesson in this class, we try and tie it to our essential question, which is \"to what extent does time and place define a person?\" In \"Outliers\", this idea of time and place is brought up constantly throughout the book, with you constantly brining up the idea that outliers are the way they are due to the opportunities given to them instead of the commonly believed idea that they are outliers due to natural talent. In several instances in the book, people were given advantages in life based off of the time and/or place in which they were born. This was prevalent in the hockey players getting a large advantage if they are born in the beginning of the year, or even that Bill Gates was born during the right time and in the right place to be a pioneer in the computer industry. I really found both of these chapters interesting, as well as chapter 3 which focused on an IQ threshold.  The first chapter, The Matthew Effect, was a very interesting concept to me. It was a great chapter to start off the book with because it gave a preface for everything to follow by explaining that hockey players born in the beginning of the year have a large advantage over those born later on. This concept makes a lot of sense, but it is just something that I have never really thought about. The second chapter, the 10,000 Hour Rule, was to me the most interesting chapter in the book. It went against all conventional knowledge that people were skilled at something based off of talent, and instead brought up the idea that they are skilled because of how much experience they have. The idea that you will master a field once you have performed 10,000 in it is also an interesting concept, although I do not know how true it is. Even though there are a few examples of it taking people 10,000 hours to master a subject, I still do not feel that value holds true in all circumstances. For example, I am sure that a lot of professional golfers have spent 10,000 hours on the game, and yet no one has come close to mastering it. Every golfer makes mistakes, and I feel that it will never be mastered. So while I think that the rule is a good general rule, it still does not hold true in every situation. Chapter 3's concept of an IQ threshold was also extremely interesting. Before reading this chapter, I had always thought that a higher intelligence would generally directly correlate to a higher level of success. However, after reading the chapter, I entirely agree with your viewpoint. Once the threshold is reached, social skills and networking are necessary to succeed. I have noticed that some people are able to make up for a lack of intelligence with their social skill. Even though someone has not reached the threshold, I believe it is still very possible for them to be more successful than someone who has. A lot of the concepts presented in your book hold true in my experiences with golf. The best players are generally those whose parents also play golf. This gives them an advantage they were born with that generally allows them to develop faster and practice more. This means that someone who is born with less skill but has this advantage can surpass someone with more skill but who lacks this advantage.",

                    "ReviewText": "Through the reading of the novel Outliers I have concluded that this particular book contrasts very well with the lessons being taught in my senior English class. Throughout the entire course we are connecting everything we learn to one essential question. To what extent do time and place define a person? I feel that Gladwell's Outliers is a great example of real life situations that connect perfectly to this question. Gladwell talks a lot about success and why and how a person gains it. This is the base of the essential question I am studying in my class because success is one of the main things that defines a person. Every chapter in this book relates to the essential question in one way or another. In the chapter The Three Lessons of Joe Flom, Gladwell focuses mainly on how disadvantages became opportunities. He tells the story of a family living during the depression and how he gained success. The Janklows story focuses on being in the wrong place at the wrong time and how they took advantage of the situation to find the success they needed. I enjoyed how Gladwell told the story of the Janklows and interpreted in his own way. In the chapter Rice Paddies and Math, Gladwell focuses on how hard work and the right opportunities will give a person success. He mentions the Asian society and the work styles they have. Due to where they lived technology was not available which forced them to focus on their work. He states that they worked harder than any other occupation pore modern era. Living in a place with less technological advantages really helped the workers gain the success they were looking for. In the chapter Marita's Bargain, Gladwell turns his attention over to a young girl who is given a chance. Marita's story connects perfectly with the essential question. She is underprivileged and living in poor community with her mom and because of this she is given the opportunity to attend a special school. Due to Marita's living conditions she was given the opportunity to possibly make it somewhere in her life. If she had been living somewhere else she might not of gotten the chance she did. This one change in her life helped define who she is as a person today and changed her life forever. I particularly liked this chapter because I felt it connected the most to the essential question. Marita was given an opportunity because of where she was living and what was going on in her life at the time. The entire book Outliers reflects the essential question I am studying and each chapter has a point in it that can connect perfectly to it.",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Malcolm Gladwell,\n\tMy name is Becca Purtell and I think that the ideas in your book Outliers, relate to the main question that is essential to my English course; to what extent do time and place define a person?  In my class, we have a central question that we focus on throughout the course while reading literature to help us draw connections with what we learn.  The chapters regarding \" the Roseto Mystery\", \"the 10,000 Hour Rule\", and \"The Three Lessons of Joe Flom\" relate specifically to the central question of my course.\n\tThe Roseto Mystery chapter explains how the Rosetans moved from their homeland and settled in a small city that consisted of people only pertaining to their specific ethnicity.  The chapter clarifies that the Rosetans tended to have a longer life rate than other people in the cities surrounding them.  These Rosetans were not in shape and they smoked &amp; drank, but they showed signs of excellent health.  Even Rosetans in other cities were not as healthy as them.  Research later showed that the reason these Rosetans had such a life rate was because of their lifestyle.  They were friendly and visited each other often.  As many as up to three generations lived in one house and grandparents were received with great esteem. They lived in a carefree environment.  In relation to my essential question, the Rosetans are a perfect example of how place defines a person.  The atmosphere and lifestyle of this particular Rosetan culture enabled many people to live longer than they normally would had they been living in another city or country.\n\tThe 10,000 Hour Rule also relates well to how time and place ultimately define a person.  In this chapter, you claim that one must have 10,000 hours of practice in their trade in order to be successful and make it big.  For example, due to Bill Gates' talent, chance, and opportunity to have free programming time from 3 am- 6 am, he was able to found Microsoft, a computer system used by millions of people daily.   For him, time and place played an extreme role in his success.  Had Bill Gates not lived near the University of Washington, he would not have been able to use the computer labs at 3 am in the morning; hence he would not have been able to achieve his 10,000 hours of experience.  Also, if Gates had not been able to access the free programming at 3 am, he would not have been able to practice his programming.  \n\tThe Three Lessons of Joe Flom is very similar to my essential question regarding time and place.  Specifically, the setting of Joe Flom's life shapes the ways of his actions.  Since he was a Jewish man in New York, he was turned away from many of the New York firms, forcing him to create his own white shoe firm.  The fact that he was Jewish and living in New York during a time when Jewish people were not hired often in big New York firms shows the extent that time and place played on his opportunities.   Also, being born in the right generation was crucial for success.  If you were born during the Great Depression, you had many more opportunities for success because class sizes were smaller, there was less competition for jobs, and it was easier to get into better schools.  This example and statement show how large an impact time and place define someone's opportunity for success.",

                    "ReviewText": "Malcolm Gladwell's \"Outliers- \"The Story of Success\" presents simple yet complex scenarios throughout the entire story. I read Gladwell's book during my Senior English class and I was very impressed with the way Malcolm writes. The story line all the way through the book is presented in a very creative, innovative and interesting manner. Gladwell discusses topics of what it takes to be successful, and whether or not summer vacation is a good or bad thing. Two characters that are talked about, Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer are talked about for most of the book. What make these two so interesting is their background stories. Gladwell does a great job comparing these two even though their childhoods were 100% different. The way his thoughts and information is presented are clear and neatly presented. Never once did I lose interest in what I was reading and I wanted to continue reading all the way to the end. You can see the love and passion that Gladwell has for his writing and that what made it so appealing to me and my classmates. There were though a couple things that were confusing and hard to understand. His thoughts are clear as I stated before, but they do become a little puzzling. And as a result of this there is another thing that may be of inconvenience. Some of the sections do become very lengthy and can become a tad boring. Even though the scenarios/topics are of a huge variety, some may seem targeted to only a certain group of people. For me in one instance, Gladwell was talking about summer vacation and whether it is a good thing or bad. He describes the students as the \"rich kids\" or the \"poor kids\" and some readers may find that as a little offensive. The final thing that I found confusing was Gladwell would present an idea, discuss it for some time and then move on to another and leave you wondering what happen with that topic. But in all, Malcolm Gladwell's book \"Outliers- The Story of Success\" is exactly what the title says, successful.",

                    "ReviewText": "Dear Mr. Gladwell,\n\tAfter reading your book, \"The Outliers\" for my Senior English class, I have been able to connect your interesting stories of success to our essential question. The question asks, to what extent does time and place define a person? The overall purpose of our essential question is for us to compare the many different scenarios and circumstances of time and place to the outcomes of success.  The question was consistently answered in many different ways throughout your book, while each chapter provided me with a lot of interesting and informative information as well. There were three chapters that stood out the most to me, and they were Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect, Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule and Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom.\n\t\"The Matthew Effect\", fascinated me the most out of all of the chapters. The details about the cut-off dates and the ice hockey players' success rates were the most interesting because before reading, I personally believed that anybody's success was determined by the fact that either they were good or they were not. The information provided in this chapter can be related to our essential question because it explains that in order to be a very successful ice hockey player, the ideal birth month is right in the beginning of January thru March. I completely agree with this because of your well-explained reasons of how the children who are born in early January thru March have a better opportunity to be successful rather than those born later in the year. Also provided were the ideal birth months for other situations such as baseball, European soccer, and even school. Though, one question I have is: how many people actually have taken the opportunities given and became so successful that they are currently or have played on a national league? I have considered that since this is such a great opportunity, that a lot of parents who would want their children to be successful in a certain sport would\" plan ahead\", though I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Regardless of never hearing these facts however, I certainly trust the statistics and completely agree with this chapter's inspiring information. Perhaps I will have to test it out with my future family! \n\t \"The 10,000 Hour Rule\" was another chapter than I found interesting because I used to be a musician myself, and actually thought about what it took so many famous musicians to get where they are today. My favorite story in this chapter was about The Beatles. I listen to them occasionally, and I know a bit about each of them from the many biography books that my mother has collected, though I did not know their unique background story of how they became the legend that they are today. I found it interesting that they kept going and playing at one particular club in Hamburg for a long time, before obtaining success. Most people, especially myself, would give up once nothing great has happened. However, The Beatles took these opportunities as more practice, in which gave them the \"10,000 hours\" they needed in order to be successful. This scenario relates to our essential question because it explains that the opportunities given to The Beatles during that time and place were what made them what they were and still are, today. A question about this chapter is, are there other bands that had similar stories to The Beatles, and if so, who are they? \n\tIn \"The Three Lessons of Joe Flom\", I learned that the three key points to",

                    "ReviewText": "In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, various stories of individuals who achieved success in several different ways are highlighted. In the \"10,000 hours\" chapter, Gladwell expresses the mantra \"practice equals perfect.\" If you work, you will achieve success. I, too, believe in this concept. However, one of Gladwell's implications within the chapter is that if one does not start pursuing a talent or goal at a young age, one will not be successful. He also says if an inadequate amount of hours are put into one's pursuit, achieving success will, too, be.unsuccessful. I personally believe if one works hard, and truly wants to attain success, they will. If they start at 30 or do not put 10,000+ hours into their endeavor, it isn't the end of the world. There is still hope and great probability that they will be successful. Another chapter that sparked my interest was \"The Matthew Effect.\" In this chapter, Gladwell uses statistics to express one's age greatly affects their success. He does so by analyzing hockey players. The children, who are the older ones in the cut-off, seem to show a greater amount of skill than those who are younger. Yes, this may be a coincidence, but I personally think this is only due to the fact that they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. Here, the older children are given special opportunities. This then accumulates to bring greater success. \"Rice Paddies and Math Tests\" was another chapter that significantly interested me. Gladwell, in this section, explains because of Asians' language and cultural background, they are better at math and work extremely hard overall. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more commonsensical than Western languages. Therefore, Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than those of the American descent. Another argument behind his theory has to do with the significant amount of labor and strength farming rice entailed for Asians. Gladwell says that the Asian culture is overall more hardworking because of the immense amount of work had to be put in to producing rice paddies, and have consequently been shaped by their ancestors to work hard. I do see validity in Gladwell's points, but I can also easily pose arguments that go against what he says. As a student who has been in honors classes all her life, I have seen the broad spectrum of students who enroll in these higher-level classes. Yes, there are Asians present in the majority of these classes, but there are many Whites and Blacks as well. I firmly believe that all students, regardless of ethnicity, have to put in the same amount of work; The Asian culture and background does not give Asian students a predisposition to the importance of endurance and perseverance. When all is said and done though, Outliers was a very interesting read. Some chapters interested me more than others, but the book as a whole forced me to see the concept of \"success,\" as well as its make-up, in a new light. Growing up in the US, we are always told that \"as long as we work hard, we will be successful.\" However, Gladwell presents his case for hard work as being not the only determinant of success.",

                    "ReviewText": "In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell relates the success of hockey players, software programmers, the Beatles, geniuses, Jewish-American lawyers, pilots, Asians, and underprivileged students to being in the right place at the right time, receiving special opportunities, and working hard. According to Gladwell, outliers are \"products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is...grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luck\" (285). In my opinion, Gladwell shows that outliers are not all that different from other people at the start of their careers. They are just lucky enough to come across certain opportunities throughout their lives that bring them success. In fact, Gladwell believes that outliers are not really outliers at all. \"The Matthew Effect\" is one of my favorite chapters. Throughout the chapter, Gladwell uses statistical analysis to show that athletic and educational age cut-offs greatly affect one's success. Older children in the cut-offs seem to show more \"talent\" than those who are younger, but that is only because they have had more time to develop physically and mentally. As a result, the older children are given special opportunities, which accumulate and bring success. I also like \"Rice Paddies and Math Tests.\" In this section, Gladwell explains that Asians are better at math because of their language and culture. He presents many valid points. For instance, he mentions that Asian languages are shorter and more logical than Western languages so Asian children learn how to count at an earlier age than their American counterparts. Once again, this initial advantage results in an \"accumulative advantage,\" in which Asians like math more, try harder, and perform better. Although I agree with most of his arguments, Gladwell excludes any information that contradicts his points. For example, any sports fan can probably list famous athletes who were born right before the cutoff date. I personally know successful people who are the youngest on their team or in their class. I also know of non-Asian people who are excellent at math. Albert Einstein was European, yet he is remembered as a genius of mathematics and physics. Unfortunately, Gladwell does not include any of these exceptions to his rules in \"The Matthew Effect\" and \"Rice Paddies and Math Tests.\" Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading Gladwell's book. Although some of the chapters moved slowly, it was a fast read overall. Gladwell's stories encouraged me to look at success from a different perspective. Living in the United States, I have been reminded all of my life about the \"American dream\" and told that as long as I work hard, I will be successful. However, as Gladwell theorizes, hard work is not the only determinant of success.",

I felt he had relevant points and research to back up his opinion (though there is research for every opinion). I agree with his overall point, which is nurture plays a larger role than nature. He takes a rather cynical approach though and rules out desire and the will to achieve something. Of course, the circumstances need to be right for something to happen, but I believe if you have the will you will find those circumstances.

                    "ReviewText": "In Outliers, The Story Of Success, Malcolm Gladwell shows research that puts forward the theory that success is a combination of factors.  While intelligence plays a large part, so do birth order, cultural assumptions, and above all hard work.  Individuals must have the ability to see opportunities and then have the skills to take advantage of them.\n\nOne of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players.  They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year.  Inexplicable coincidence?  No, more likely that this phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed.  Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams.\n\nThis plays out over and over again when trends are seen.  The dot-com millionaires?  Almost all were born from 1952-1955, when the computer was first introduced to the public, and kids in schools could get hours upon hours of programming time.  Successful musicians?  Most practice hundreds more hours than those who just never quite make it to the top.  Both groups are talented, but one group takes advantage of opportunities and hard work to develop that talent.\n\nIn one study, bright children in California were tested and tracked for over forty years.  Although all started in the brightest groups, by adulthood they had fallen into the superstars, the average and those who didn't quite make it.  Luck of the draw?  That assumption can be challenged when the facts show that those in the bottom group almost overwhelmingly had parents who were uninvolved in their lives and who didn't help their children focus and refine their talents.  Parenting styles seem to make a big difference.\n\nGladwell has written a thought-provoking book.  His thesis can be summed up in this quote: \"...success follows a predictable course.  It is not the brightest who succeed.  Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf.  It is, rather, a gift.  Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ...To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all.\"  This book is recommended for readers that are interested in learning how the world works and how we might improve it.",

                    "ReviewText": "Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most educated, eye-opening, reader friendly books I have ever read. And that's saying something. Being thirteen years old, many books relating to this topic are quite complex and hard to understand. However, Outliers has understandable comparisons and simpler topics in a way that makes it comprehendible but interesting at the same time. Now don't go thinking this is a simple, seventh grade read. It's not. Outliers is sophisticated and intelligent.\n\tIn this succulent statistical story of success, Malcolm Gladwell talks about the outliers of humanity: Bill Gates, Joe Flom, Christopher Langan, and so on. He discusses why Asians are good at math, \"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\" (title of chapter seven), and what really happens over summer vacation for high poverty and upper class. And most of all, he talks about their stories. According to Outliers, there is no such thing as \"rags to riches.\" All those remarkable and extremely successful people got where they were by some chance, and ten thousand hours of practice. Ten thousand hours. That's the magic number. If you get that many hours of doing something, then you will be a master. However, it takes more than drive to get to this ambitious goal: you have to the opportunity to reach it. It just so happened that Bill Gates's school was one of the first to have a computer terminal, and it just so happened that he lived right by the University of Washington which just so happened to also have a computer terminal with free hours from three to six, and so on and so on. \nI only have one argument with Malcolm Gladwell on his book. He forgot to account for genetics and the exceptional person's drive that makes him want to spend every possible moment programming on a computer. How would Joe Flom have become one of the most successful lawyers in America if he hadn't tried hard at school and worked hard enough to get into Harvard Law. Yes, these people had outstanding chances, but without their drive, they would be nowhere.\n\tI loved Outliers. Malcolm Gladwell did his homework. He uses graphs, charts, and illustrations to convey his point. He gives real-life examples of experiments. Malcolm Gladwell is just right. Outliers changed my world.",
