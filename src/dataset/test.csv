Mauro Kusznir,5,Outstanding work!,A thought-provoking book. Cleary explains how the outliers have accomplished success. It makes you to think about how some innocent facts make huge difference in life. I couldn't recommend more this book,Avaliado no Brasil em 14 de fevereiro de 2021
Oscar Lima,1,Problemas com a formatação do livro,Encontrei diversos problemas com a formatação do livro no formato eletrônico: trechos faltando e trechos repetidos. Não inviabiliza a leitura mas foi decepcionante.,Avaliado no Brasil em 16 de julho de 2021
Spectrum314k,1,Journalism and pseudoscience,"Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 12 de novembro de 2017
Stiven Skyrah,5,Salient and grounded,"​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.""",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 3 de março de 2018
J C Mitchinson,3,Interesting enough but certainly no revelation,"Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 23 de junho de 2014
Marty M,5,Fascinating and  thought-provoking,"It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the  most special of humans have been the  product of  their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the  opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 17 de janeiro de 2019
bobrayner,3,Enjoyable read but scientifically it makes me feel uneasy,"I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 18 de fevereiro de 2020
Paul Walsh,5,"Wonderfully interesting, easy to read, amazing findings","Brilliant book for exemplifying patterns in human behaviour. I am not reading it in order to look at improving the odds of success in life - not as a sociologist or psychologist.....and I find it very gripping and the evidence against the examples is brilliant. I take each chapter as a chapter of learning but the sort of learning which implants itself in your mind instead of needing to try and take it all in. It is written in a way that the knowledge provided naturally settles in your mind. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at success, improving odds, running a business, psychology, sociology",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 1 de setembro de 2018
GoldenHen,2,Over-hyped Book with a Lack of Convincing Conclusions,"To be honest, I still don't get the point of this book. Chapter after chapter, the same statement is made, that success in life is more to do with where you come from than with anything else. So what? Are we supposed to become all defaitist about this now, as we cannot really influence our fate in life? As so often in american books of this type, it is dense in quoting from all sorts of random research, which makes it at times tiring to read. Anecdotes that may or may not be convincing provide for some more relaxed reading, but the author's conclusions (if any) are often not convincing. So the Chinese are better at maths because they have an easier system of naming their numbers? And why does that then all of a sudden apply to all Asians, even though not all Asian languages share the same feature?",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 17 de agosto de 2014
tallmanbaby,4,one great read,"At heart this is a cracking set of essays around the theme of achieving excellence, and despite the technical basis and dry subject it manages to read like a thriller.

IS,5,Interesting….,"First book I read from the author and I found his approach quite interesting. It is great that he doesn’t sugarcoat things. The key to success is……. well it’s down to main factors and this is what this book is about. I liked that it gives you a wider sense of what makes up success and his points were logical and pragmatic. There is not always an easy road as some of us may think, it takes quite a lot to be an outlier…Easy to read, he makes his points in a very grounded way. Will read more of his books for sure. This one was worth it!",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 28 de dezembro de 2021

AM Brody,5,Compelling book which makes you reassess achievement,This is a wonderful book which looks deeply into people who have achieved huge success and analysis what was going on. He argues that the circumstances around these people have a lot to do with their success without diminishing the hard work and intelligence they brought to their subject.,Avaliado no Reino Unido em 10 de fevereiro de 2021
@Timothy_Hughes,5,We can all be outliers and this book explains how!,"What is an Outlier?  How do people become outstanding in their field?  Are the born with a skill?  Do you have to learn a skill?  Do you have to be born at the right time?  Or is being an Outlier, a number of steps of “luck”?  The Beatles, Bill Gates, happen to have a number of circumstances that accumulated to make sure they were in the right place at the right time.  Were they the brightest or the best?  As well as having skill and aptitude you also have to have the strength and presence of mind to seize them.  We can all be outliers and this book explains how!",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 16 de dezembro de 2019
Special,4,Malcolm Gladwell Always Seems To Get It Right,"I got this book on recommendation. I have read other Gladwell books so expected it to be a good read. It just confirms what most people think deep down, when opportunity meets hard work you win. Separately neither of these two things will guarantee you success.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 12 de março de 2022
Steve,4,I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone,"Compellingly and skillfully written. As someone who is around the same age as Bill Gates, yet missing the billions, I was deeply impressed by the material in the first half of this book. The author is adept at selling his ideas and I formed the impression that he had researched the examples extensively. Indeed, there are further details about his sources at the end. However, the second half seemed to drag a bit, for me (perhaps I was still depressed after reading the first half), but offered further support for the ideas presented in the first half. I'd recommend this book as a great read for anyone, and in particular for those who, like myself, may feel that they could have shone brighter, if only life had chosen them instead.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 1 de outubro de 2017
Spoda,5,Wonderful,"Bought this following a recommendation and loved it. It’s honestly one of the best books I’ve read. Interesting, intriguing and fascinating. The groups studied are varied and broad and the stories covered will allow you to glimpse ways that we are and aren’t responsible for our success. I couldn’t put it down. The chapter on Korean pilots was very moving in its detail and tragedy. Will read more of Mr Gladwell’s books as a result.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 3 de setembro de 2019
Expatista,4,"Should have been called ""Luck""","My most intellectual friends say Gladwell is criticised for his ""pop"" coverage of ideas that are normally the provenance of academics, but I like his readable, confident style. His books have become extremely influential; every American parent I know espouses some version of the ideas in The Tipping Point. This is another one to freak parents out: a book claiming that behind every great man and woman is a whole lot of being in the right place at the right time.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 23 de dezembro de 2014
A. Davies,5,Food for thought,"Outliers is my book of the year so far. I know I'm late to the party, but it really made me think.

Diana Prince,5,Epic,"Excellent book. Particularly recommended for teenagers (and their parents) who wonder why they might be under-performing or what they will end up doing with their life. It is full of 'A ha"" moments  When I first started reading it I wasn't enthralled but as the author started to show connections and underlying situations that build up to success, I was  really impressed.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 31 de março de 2019
daud bhatti,5,Not what I expected but a great read!,"I was expecting a self help book on trying to be sucessful. No dont be mislead this is a book not telling you have success in your own control but rather the opposite. Its still a great book, that is written amazingly with some really relevant and interesting examples. The chapter on Bill Gates is a story I have found myself telling others about",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 23 de abril de 2021
Laurence,4,Well written and some good examples but I'm not sure how balanced this is,"This has some good stories to illustrate the points and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure how balanced it is - everything is presented as fact when I feel that there should be a counter view.  As other reviewers have said, at its heart this is something you could get across in perhaps 20 pages.  It's testament to the author that he keeps you reading and engaged with many more pages than that.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 17 de setembro de 2019
Cols,4,A good book,"A better read than i thought it would be.  I purchased this as the kindle daily deal and thought it might be ok but not that good, but i was wrong. It's a great book and i enjoyed it a lot.

Álvaro Nieto,5,"I definitely recommend it, it makes you at least consider if ...","Although the author Tries to make you look twice at what you thought were life's predestinations, it does so by choosing very precise close space situations and drawing conclusions from them. I would normally say it is dangerous to draw a universal law of things from such a finite number of observations.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 8 de novembro de 2017
Mike Brady,5,"Much more than 10,000 hours","I came to this book for it popularising the 10,000 hour theory - some say over-simplifying. I was surprised and then delighted to find that is just one reference in a book drawing together many insightful ideas to unpick the myths of what makes someone successful. The 10,000 hours theory gives us hope that any one of us can become an outlier, a success in a chosen field. But as Malcolm Gladwell reveals, there are other factors, many beyond our control, which should keep us humble if successful and tolerant of those who missed out. I look forward to reading his other books.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 9 de outubro de 2021

Stephen George,4,Enjoyable read,Having read reviews for and against the book I thought I would read it - especially as it was a Kindle special. It's an easy read and although a little repetitive I did enjoy it and do think he makes some good points. In the end it's probably a little too simplistic in its conclusions but that doesn't spoil it as a good book.,Avaliado no Reino Unido em 27 de julho de 2017
Stephen Smith,5,Jam-packed with interesting anecdotes,"This book is full of interesting stuff: From why one rural community in the US had amazing health to how plane crashes happen. It's main aim is to show the accidental or environmental factors that have been a major contributor to the success of certain people or groups of people. My only warning to the reader is not to believe success just comes down to luck. Even without the type of lucky circumstances Malcolm Gladwell writes about, there are still plenty of people who achieve success through belief and perseverance. (Try also reading Mindset by Carol Dweck.)",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 5 de fevereiro de 2020

Jyldyz Re,2,A bit boring,"I bought this book for my middle son to read together as it was recommended to me as inspirational book.

Akhil B,3,Not as I had thought,The book gives good info but stories have too much of unnecessary details which I personally never liked in non-fiction. I picked this book because I wanted to know what makes outliers an outlier in their field which I eventually got but I had to read a lot many details in between. I understand to make a book like this interesting some details must be their but too much of it makes me uncomfortable. It’s a personal choice and others might find this interesting.,Avaliado no Reino Unido em 17 de maio de 2020
Bargain Betty,5,Fantastic (but don't read it before a flight),"The author has that unique skill of being able to view and interpret the World exactly as it is, not tinted by any preconceptions or expectations. His 10,000 hr rule, from my personal experience, is bang on. I found this book was similar in vein to Freakonomics which I also recommend, and Tipping Point has also been on my list for a while so I will definitely be reading that sometime soon.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 27 de outubro de 2015
giovanni,5,Will make you question who you are,"This book will make you question who you are - where you come from, what's your legacy, and what helped you accomplish whathever you've achieved so far in your life. It will also make you ask, do I have 10,000 hours of experience in something so far? Recommended read.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 5 de setembro de 2019
C. Brown-quinn,4,Thinking Differently about Successful People,"I found Malcolm Gladwell's presentation of the subject of success fascinating! He incorporated a lot of interesting research to back up his arguments about why successful people are successful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in stretching their minds past commonly held beliefs. I still maintain, however, that regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, success isn't given even if you're offered an opportunity - you've got to take that opportunity and that's what makes successful people successful. Others have been offered opportunities, but they don't go for it. Also I would have like to have seen more stories about female success stories.

DarraghD,3,Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic,"Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 28 de maio de 2013

Mr DJ Mattingley,5,Great read.,"This was an interesting book, that grabbed me from the first line.  Gladwell provides logical reasoning and sense behind his ""theory / arguments"".  Being that I work for one of the outliers he describes in this book (which I did not know prior to reading) this made it all the more interesting.  What Gladwell basically describes in this book is that intelligence is not a precursor to success, however chance, effort and other variables will help you along your way.  Worth a read and I have gone on to buy the rest of Gladwells books.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 19 de julho de 2014
Roger B,4,A very thought provoking read!,This book was recommended to me by an education professional and although the book is several years old it has significant relevance today.

But I had wanted to hear about traits or skills or lifestyle modifications that could make a person excel more. There are snippets of advice that a city council might enact, but nothing for the reader to do other than to say ... 'huh'.  It felt like the author was showing off, making something for 'general reading' when really it is a statistical report on how to make better policies.  I came away with nothing except a collection of long winded stories of how certain cities manage eg sports teams and why process A works better.

The often mentioned ten thousand hours of practice (work) is just one factor. But the real reason why some people succeed, while others don't are a combination of ""ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage"". Among the opportunities and arbitrary advantages are for example: Born at the right time in the year, at the right time in history, in the right city, by the right parents, going by chance to the right university (no, its not the best university, just the right one), having the right cultural background (Jew, Asian, etc.), and many others.",Avaliado na Alemanha em 30 de julho de 2017

Fiona W,5,"Friendly style and simply brilliant, buying copies for friends!",What I really love about this book is the way Malcolm Gladwell 'speaks' to the reader. I feel like he's there right with me as a friend explaining something to me during a conversation. He's great. Also of course what he has to say is fascinating too and backed up with interesting examples. I felt relieved (yet also disappointed) that he hadnt added a whole self-help type chapter or anything to the book (i.e if you find yourself in X situation then try these 3 solutions) as that would have reduced his credibility. Yet BECAUSE his credibility and friendly approach is so engaging I felt I would have trusted him to give me advice!?!

Areeba ,4,Amazing,"I am a student at the University of Twente enrolled in the Honours program Entrepreneurship and Business development. As a reading assignment I was assigned to read the book “Outliers” by Malcolm Gladwell. In his book Gladwell explains with a lot of examples what it takes to be successful. I really liked the way he used the examples of real-world successful people such as Bill Gates to explain his important points. The main point Gladwell made is that Success depends on a lot of factors not just one’s determination and willingness, a person needs luck as well as the culture matters and many other factors. Also, what I liked is that he explained that to become an expert one must have a practice of 10,000 hours so talent alone won’t make a person successful besides that practice does matter. This book really helped me to understand where I as an individual need to work upon to get the success I am looking for in my personal life. Outliers by Gladwell is an amazing illustration for Entrepreneurship students to read about how success can be achieved through practice not just the inherited talent an individual processes. It is a motivation for a person who wants to become an entrepreneur but does not have an inborn talent that even he/she can become successful if some things are taken care of such as a lot of practice, seeing and grabbing opportunity at the right time.",Avaliado na Alemanha em 22 de março de 2022

For me it was more of a wake-up call to be wary of the opportunities you yourself may be given and be willing to take those opportunities, work hard, and one day be able to do something great for the world. Maybe this is because I feel that I am in the sort of position these people once were with respect to my current career path but I think the main point is just to gain awareness of the obstacles some of us may have to overcome, whether its surrounding ourselves with better people or searching for opportunities in a field that is important to us.

Gladwell as usual poses the conventional wisdom and then proceeds to tear it to shreds in example after example of how famous people have obtained success. He boils the potential for success down to two temporal factors: when a person is born in relation to major social or technological changes and how much time it takes to become very proficient at something. While native intelligence is important, it is not the critical factor in determining the potential for success. Over and over, Gladwell provides examples which show that luck, being at the right place at the right time and spending an inordinate amount of time perfecting a task are the determinants of success.",Avaliado no Canadá em 5 de novembro de 2015

A. Volk,5,A fascinating look at success,"Gladwell exposes something I've long held to be true myself: great success requires great luck.  It also requires great talent and effort to capitalize on that luck, but luck is just as necessary.  For example, if you're not born in the first few months of the year, your chances of being a pro-hockey player are dramatically reduced.  Based on your astrological sign!  That's not because of astrology, its because kids are ranked by year of birth, and those born earlier in the year are bigger, faster, and more coordinated on average because they're just older.  And that means they're more likely to be chosen on special teams, where they get special coaching, further emphasizing their initial difference.  That continues over the years until there's a tremendous gap between them and other, later-born children.  Is that fair?  No.  It's just luck and the way the system is currently set up.  Intriguingly, Gladwell suggests that these kinds of systems essentially miss 50% of a population's talent because they shunt out all those born in the later part of the year.  That's a really interesting idea- a population could increase its pool of elite athletes (or students) by breaking them into 6-month groups, rather than 1-year groups.",Avaliado no Canadá em 5 de novembro de 2009

I enjoyed the book like I would enjoy a big cake topped with loads of whipped cream but, after finishing it I'm not completely satisfied. It definitely makes you think, but in many too many words; each point is enforced by several examples, and in between the point is repeated over and over again. And the analysis is not very deep. This is not specific to this book, but this is inherently the author's style. This is an enjoyable book for a plane ride.",Avaliado na França em 10 de novembro de 2013

Ben Finn,2,A string of anecdotes doth not a theory make,"This started out as an interesting book - the first Gladwell I've read - though I gave up on it halfway through. The reason being, it's written in a highly populist style, full (as far as I got) of lengthy anecdotes about individuals' life stories, which he stitches together to form an argument. But if you're arguing for what is in essence an academic theory, a bunch of increasingly tedious stories - mere anecdotal evidence - interspersed with bits of breathless journalistic reasoning just doesn't cut the mustard. So I got bored after a while and gave up.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 16 de novembro de 2015

Frazinho,4,Interesting and thought provoking,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon (thanks, BTW), and I found it an interesting and insightful read.

I have now bought 14 copies of Outliers for family and friends. Anyone with half a brain and an enquiring mind must read it. What a xmas present it makes!  And, by the way, his latest book - 'What the dog saw' is just as inspirational - a fantastic expose of error and misunderstanding on matters of huge significance.

AR,4,Extremely inspiring! This book offers an alternative perspective on the requirement for success,"'Outliers' is really a masterpiece. It challenges the 'rags to riches' concept in which individual prowess is often given too much credit for. Malcolm argues that there are conditions that give rise to these outliers. in this book, he explores the different conditions for an extraordinary success (whether in sports, law, music, art and other fields) and points out that for one to succeed big time, one needs more than a great IQ or a genius mind. The only negative aspect is that the book gets kindda repetitive towards the end.",Avaliado no Reino Unido em 18 de agosto de 2017

He usually avoids pseudo-science and stimulates deep thinking and interesting from hidden systems-level linkages.  Well, usually.....In Outliers the reliance on narrative and the absence of substance left me feeling this book was  just a thought bubble generating revenue in between the real works.  Interesting but, at the price, adding little to my own understanding or deeper reflection his earlier and last works triggered.  I started to skip through anecdotes that were too U.S. culturally oriented to translate beyond a specific context. Meant to be 'case studies' these stories produced threads of logic that didn't knit together.  Upon reaching the end I literally threw may hands because I was still waiting for the punch line.

More importantly, it draws an intriguing inference that success might not necessarily have a direct co-relation with hard work and circumstances and opportunities along the way play a much larger role than what we might agree to settle for.

Karunakaran N,5,A great read.,Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell... An enlightening book. The socio economic background of any individual plays a pivitol role for the individual success. The author spells out the success stories of many individuals whom we know on these lines. Very interesting to note that being born in a particular year leads anyone to success provided the 10000 hour rule is followed. A through research perspective on IQ levels and making of Genius. The realistic aspect is the author quoting his own lineage to prove his viewpoint. A great read... requires another read.,Avaliado na Índia em 3 de janeiro de 2015

MJ,5,OUTLIERS REVIEW,"Outliers - a person or thing differing from all other members of a particular group or set. Outliers is a fascinating book by Malcolm Gladwell which inspires the reader to the core. In this book, Gladwell analyses success and opportunity. He answers the questions of how people achieve so much and how can they differ from other people. He looks at everyone from athletes to software programmers, from gems lost in the dust to Asian farmers. He reveals that our background and upbringing matter a lot more than how we think they do, who we are, what we do and where we are from matters a lot more than intelligence and that correct guidance is tool in your belt. He states that no one, even a genius never makes it alone and how luck and opportunity, even your birthdate makes you an outlier.",Avaliado na Índia em 16 de janeiro de 2017

The flow in which this is written is as much good as the idea it pitches. Coming to the idea, Gladwell proposes that performance comes from consistent work (practice). And upon that he adds layers and layers of point of views which you might or might not have thought about. Basically the book tells that the Outlier is not only the function of his intrinsic work ethic by also the opportunites which build that ethic. The key takeaway was that the Outliers are not incidental and complete gift of nature but can be manufactured (we need more of them of course) by ensuring atleast equity in opportunity to everyone.",Avaliado na Índia em 29 de agosto de 2017

That idea and attitude is ridiculous - the Universe is neither for or against you. Success in life depends largely on internal factors, not how or where you grew up, whether or not you were poor, when your birthday is, or who your parents are. These things may help but they will not determine how far you will go in life - success is when preparation meets opportunity, which is true for all the examples in the book.  On that note, the examples in the book are all MEN. As a successful, educated woman, this is offensive given this book was written in 2008 and not 1950. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN??!!

The author proves, through a series of logical examples, that those that our society deem ""the great ones"", have more to do with a series of lucky breaks meeting preparation than some innate ability.  That being said, the book gave me hope.  It is definitely NOT written in a hopeful or inspirational tone.  Its redundant points are presented very logically and matter-of-fact (other reviewers say ""boring"").  Potato/po-tah-to... Example after example....after example, the pattern that emerged for me was destiny is real, that even as early as our birth, the universe is conspiring to lead us in the direction of our purpose.  We each have a series of ""lucky"" breaks as well as unfortunate events that are directing our paths. We can chose to lean in and pursue or be crushed by the redirection.  Once I shifted my focus, the authors examples were exciting and eye-opening.  As I said, I've not yet completed the book.  Gladwell may very well bring it together in this way by the end (fingers crossed), but regardless, reading it from that aspect makes it much more of a page turner.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 9 de novembro de 2017

Tony R.,5,The Insights of Outliers,"There are many books on the market that dissect success. They often talk about perseverance, determination, creativity, and hard work. What Malcolm Gladwell has done in 'Outliers' is take a deep dive into the rarely examined factors that give an edge to one set of gifted individuals over a similarly gifted set. Sometimes the factors are beyond the control of people, such as a team of hockey players who were born within a set few months of the year versus those athletes born in other months. Or the creative types who practice their art a minimum of 10,000 hours versus those who practice less. Each chapter is an eye-opener and sheds a bright light on what makes someone a success and someone else, with similar skills, less of a success. Gladwell's style is a journalistic matter of fact tone which will keep you reading while clearly understanding the points being made. This book does a fine job of investigating each surprising case study without lecturing or making the material too complicated to understand. For anyone who has ever wondered why maybe they or their child or spouse didn't succeed where someone else who was no smarter or more gifted did succeed, this book might offer a clue. It's a must have. Highly recommended.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 26 de setembro de 2018

Jennifer P,3,meh,"3-3.5stars out of 5 stars. Gladwell sets his premise on the idea that “self-made” stars/high performers are less “self-made” and more a mix of hard work, many hours, and ethnic and cultural legacies. While he does bring up good considerations on how we view success, I feel some of his arguments fall short in their rigor. For example, he correlates work ethic to cultivate rice with Asian (actually mainly East Asian but he doesn’t make that distinction from most other Asian countries/cultures) but his attempts to turn it into a causation fall short despite his insistence that there is a causal relationship. If anything, many of his chapters feel so focused on ethnicity that they miss the stronger point about one’s environment. Since the initial release of this book (2008), there has been excellent discussion in 10,000 hour rule, grit, mastery, etc that bear consideration for the modern reader. His discussion on education focuses too much on time spent vs standardized test scores without touching on what benefits (social, soft skills, etc) are built outside the classroom. In terms of writing style, I felt that he was at times long winded before making his connections and don’t understand how others have called this book “explosively entertaining.” In term of book design, the paperback has a nice matte feel and comfortably pliable, creamy pages that open nicely and are easy on the eyes. The white book cover is nice until I accidentally pet my dogs dirty head and get noticeable smudges afterwards.

David,5,Incredibly interesting and thoroughly enjoyable!,"“Outliers: The Story of Success,” by Malcolm Gladwell, is a highly engaging book that explores how people are able to surpass the average standard of success, and how they have come to reach that point.  Gladwell organizes the book in two parts and dedicating each chapter to a particular person, theory, or story. He combines cultural context, psychology and physiology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize what creates success. Gladwell packs each chapter with data, statistics, and specific examples to support all his claims, and the data gathered is interesting to review when reading. He does a great job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. The theories talked about in the chapters were insightful, and offered new understandings of what creates success. Although Gladwell tends to ramble, the book was incredibly thought-provoking, and lead to many deep and interesting conversations between myself and others who were reading it. If you’re willing to really analyze the content, it could definitely leave an impact on your life.

Todeco,3,An ok book,"I am a bit disappointed with this book. Yes, the examples of different successful people with their background like where they are coming from, their family, teachers, opportunities, the time they were lucky to be born on so on explains how they got where they got, BUT what about other people who weren’t so lucky to be born at the right time and in the right place (like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates 1995 or hockey players who were born mostly January to March who had the luck to make it in life understandably through hard work and tears of course) but who also had the very opportunities not like millions of others. What does this book offers for the regular people less lucky to be born in the right year or go to the best school or being able to read Shakespear at the age of 4? It is very repetitive with different stories of different successful people, that’s all. It goes same scenario other and other. Got to the half of the book and trying to hang on till the end of it, but from reading the names of the next chapters, the same routine is awaiting for me ahead which does not give me much motivation to finish it. I admit, the book does explain the hard work and passion people put into achieving their goals but I did not intend to buy the book to read people’s biographies. Seems like if you weren’t smart and special at the young age nothing special and great awaits for you in adulthood, just an ordinary life. Hmm does that sound inspiring?

Overall the point is that people who have succeeded to the point that they can be called ""outliers"" did not achieve their success alone.  In many instances the luck of their birth date provided the crucial first step ahead and in some the culture in which they were born proved to be the extra impetus needed to get ahead and stay there.

Brilliant message that has the ring of truth in spite of any perceived rhetorical weakness or sub-scholarly merit some critics are quick to point out.

josh casillas,3,Easy read; not many actionable takeaways,"I read this book over the course of several weeks and found it engaging and entertaining - very anecdote heavy. Does not delve deep into scientific/research theories of success, with exception of Hofstede's cultural elements, which tbh are pretty widely known already. Toward the end, the author waxes eloquent explaining why the cultural values springing from Chinese farming are very much superior to the values springing from ""Western"" style farming. I understand what he's getting at, and it holds water to some extent. But the whole point of the book is to explain outliers - people who are extroadinarily successful, particularly in business. Frankly, in modern history the percentage of outliers (richest, most influential people worldwide) coming from China is significantly lower than the percentage of outliers coming from the US. Chinese students score significantly higher on tests than US students, particularly in math - but does that make them outliers?",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 27 de junho de 2019
James Kwon Lee,3,Entertaining but somewhat irresponsible and lacking in how it portrays its arguments,"I give it 5-stars for entertainment value and a 2-stars for reliability. My biggest problem with this book is that it heavily downplays the importance of intelligence, and this is to ""inspire"" readers. Gladwell makes a lot of assumptions and jumps to easy conclusions on topics that are frankly not that simple. For example, in one chapter he talks about how you only need to be ""smart enough"" (120 IQ) to have a shot at being the best at whatever you do. He cites a list of Nobel Prize winners and the Universities they graduated from--claiming that graduates from schools like Holy Cross and Georgetown have Nobel Laureates too, and not all Prize winners are from Harvard or MIT as we may stereotypically believe. This is a fallacious assumption as IQ does not perfectly correlate with one's alma mater, and ironically, Gladwell does not account for the outliers that exist within every single school. People go to different universities for a variety reasons, one primarily being economic cost and another being the proximity to the parents' or family's home. For example, even if you're the brightest, most accomplished high schooler in all of America, chances are, you might go to Holy Cross over Harvard if you happen to live closer to Holy Cross and the aforementioned school offered you a full scholarship. Gladwell should have just listed the IQ numbers of the Nobel Laureates to avoid the extra layer of ambiguity. Also, the way the author presents his arguments, about how IQ is not as important as the knowledge of being able to communicate with and persuade people, neglects the complexity of IQ based intelligence. For example, a Nobel laureate may have a 120 (non-genius) IQ, but what if s/he were tested in the domain of his specific speciality? Would a world-class architect with ""only"" an IQ of 120, for example, score ""only"" a 120 on spatial intelligence? I doubt it. I hypothesize that if you break down people's ""intelligences,"" most experts will tend to excel at the specific domain that is needed in their specialities, even if their IQ's were normal overall.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 10 de fevereiro de 2015
madhavi bommakanti,5,Very Good Buy!,"Outliers is one of those books that, on the outset, seemed very drab, as I almost immediately read through statistics and tables. However, as I read on, I became more and more immersed in the book, relishing the amount of evidence he has given for each of his claims. He tells us the in depth stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, the Beatles, and more in an attempt to find the combination of advantages that these people enjoyed and made these people successful. At first, his claims are a little outlandish; what connection do rice fields and Asians being good at math have? After reading through all of his logic, however, I now ask myself why I didn't think in this manner before! This book is a rare and good read because the author very clearly explains the problem(s) in the way society generally looks at success, an corrects it, in detail. Doing so, he makes learn, introspect, and change your own thoughts on success according to the evidence given. I sincerely believe that each person should read Outliers as they enter high school or college, as they are pivotal stages in their lives; after reading this, they would recognize the different aspects in their own lives that could make them successful and exploit them.

Start from the top left corner of the puzzle and notice the heart shapes, they all exist in three vertical lines. Then, to its right and to its down, notice the diamond shapes in those two pictures, they too are placed in all three vertical lines, and the rest merely has two. Again, observe the slant line from top right to bottom left and notice the club shapes, they are in three vertical lines, and the remain only have two. Do you see the pattern? At the middle left and middle bottom, we are back to heart shapes. So, one thing that we can be sure about the last one is that there are three club shapes exist in three vertical lines, which leaves option A, F, and C.

People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.""",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 22 de setembro de 2013

IEsteban,5,Great lessons.,"If you read a lot of self-help books, Outliers puts the icing on the cake. It reinforces the fact that the most gifted people literally had time, sources of opportunity, used their abilities to negotiate for what they need, and literally took advantage of the number of hours in a day to get ahead. Bill Gates had all this, the point is even if he was just gifted, he needed all of the above to get where he is right now. He might not have Microsoft if he didn't have all these opportunities. The thing I took from this book is that we all have opportunities, we just have to realize the things we have under our control, we can make use of, and we absolutely HAVE to be aware of so we can take advantage, no matter how underpriveledged or poor we might be. Even if our culture we grew up with sets us back (spoiler: Korean airline story), we can always learn to get over our past cultural standards to work better with others, or even use our cultural ways to apply to other areas in life (another spoiler: rice paddy work ethic and business-minded planting).

Mikio Miyaki,5,Success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.,"Outliers is a book about successors. Malcolm Gladwell analyzes success follows a predictable course. Success is a gift, he asserts, not simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf, nor given to the brightest. Outliers are who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize opportunities given to them. From this perspective, Matthew’s words, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath,” makes sense to us. Success is the result of accumulative advantage. Past successors were born at the right time with the right parents and the right ethnicity. Gladwell claims we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success, the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history, with a society that provides opportunities for all to build a better world.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 7 de novembro de 2014

sdone,5,We all know or have heard of one of these. Why are they so interesting?,"There is little doubt that Malcolm Gladwell is an engaging story teller, clearly a result of his his background as a journalist. His style is both easy to read and informative. The individuals whose lives and stories he uses to illustrate his points are at once interesting and at the same time well chosen to illuminate the issues under his social microscope. These are stories told with enough detail, often gleaned from personal interviews with the people at whom he chooses to look in intimate detail. He avoids in large measure the narrow vision that such inspection may yield by also investigating the social sciences that have searched out the details of such difficult concepts. Everyone has some idea who ""makes it"" and who does not. That is often easy to see because life rewards those who make great effort in general. The difficult part is understanding why some succeed so well and others who may be even more gifted do not, at least in terms of the world's way of rewarding the star performers. It is often the grist of of rumor and innuendo as to why or how some people make it to the top of the ""food chain."" But to analyze the reasons carefully and then apply the scientific data of real studies to those stories brings this clearly into the realm of reality, if we ever really know that that is. As one who has spent a lifetime trying to apply the results of scientific study to the real world I found his approach noteworthy because of its practical applicability. I have read many dry textbooks, articles and studies and sometimes had difficulty seeing their real world application.

On the other hand, though, it is exciting to think of the potential that realization awakens.

So with the book you get great biographical stories about the Beatles and Silicon Valley moguls and the like.

How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, ""Practice makes perfect."" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too.  The one thing I feel that I struggle against  daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year  chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school.

I do seriously like the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master something.  However, these people were born at the right time to get to 10,000 hours sooner than anyone else is what is proposed.

The book is broken up into section or parts that allow you to focus on one concept at a time and truly ingest all of the information being passed. In part one Gladwell takes the time to describe how opportunities are very important. He relates opportunity to timing in a way that acts as a function of time. The author notes how the timing of the birth of notable people such as Bill Gates provided a great opportunity that would not have been available to me being born years later. I especially enjoyed when the author talks about 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This was very intriguing to me because I believe that some people mistake luck for expertise.  As an entrepreneur, this book is a fundamental tool in forming the proper mindset to achieve success.

Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 4 de agosto de 2010

What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart.

Mitchell Vega,5,A collective sigh of relief from gifted underachievers everywhere,"It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. ""Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life"" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one ""the best"". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 20 de dezembro de 2012

The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, ""How did these people become remarkable?"" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper.

Robert Abell,4,Outliers Are Not Really Outliers,"I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed.  The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair.  Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November.  It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year.  Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children.  They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year.  However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year.  As the school years pass, the gap widens.  A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform.  Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 25 de janeiro de 2011

No longer does a family need feel they are not going to have their young grow up to be leaders.  Its all about the parents.  We are the creators of our own children's destiny.  And for so long parents would complain about how this system and that person stood in the way of our child's success...WRONG!  its us.

Also studied are the early figures from the Rockefellers and the Morgans (as in JP Morgan).  There were circumstances that allowed these famously successful figures early access to the 10,000 hours required to build real expertise (for sports, computer programming and musical performance as a band), and in all cases there was a ""right place at right time"" factor that was critically important.

Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck.  I agreed with everything in the book.  It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.  Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against.  That is unfair.

Although business-inclined folk might see this as a challenge to their tenets (hard work and talent = success), to me, it felt invigorating. It showed me that the meaning of success has been smeared and misunderstood, while Gladwell argued for a redefinition. Do not fear, business people. This book won't tell you that success is basically luck and that your hard work will be for nothing. It will tell you, though, that you must be able to recognize your environment for what it is, and how you can make it work. It will tell you that the road to success is convoluted and sometimes hidden in plain sight.

The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book.

Greg Walkup,5,But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be,"The central message percolating within Outliers is the context of one's life must never be ignored nor given short shrift.  But is it not true that we cannot measure success until in many instances far past the life has been lived and historians may be the worst at finding where success has settled?  We are far too complex and the connections of the stretch of our lives much too complicated to give the proper value due each person.  How can we possibly know if Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln were truly successful because we cannot know the full ramifications of their work and lives?  Everyone thinks they know what success is, as if it is intuitive and yet what is the true plumb line for success?  Do we really have a handle on that?  Was Stalin a success because he got the metro system in place in Moscow?  Was Micky Mantle a success because he built a Hall of Fame career?

Rudolph M Ten-Pow,4,Not talent alone,"The simple truth that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success, which is the thesis of Outliers, is beyond dispute and, at some level, an obvious one. But Gladwell brings to this work, his third bestseller in a row, such enthusiastic scholarship, persuasive reasoning and command of language, that he reinforces the lesson indelibly. Despite the heaviness of a few sections here and there, Outliers is a highly readable work and some of its descriptive passages, like the preface to his chapter on Harlan, Kentucky, are truly memorable. The author's thesis is that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. It is not the brightest who succeed. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. The case histories he uses to illustrate his arguments are familiar ones to which we can easily relate, especially when he peers more closely behind the well-worn stories of contemporary superachievers (Bill Gates, Jewish lawyers, Asian students) and looks at the convergence of all the other factors (some fortuitous - dare we call it luck?) that create the opportunities for their talent to flourish. The autobiographical account at the end is particularly effective. He includes a glancing reference to a fellow superachiever of Jamaican descent - his cousin Colin Powell.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 11 de janeiro de 2009

The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist.

In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the ""magic formula"" seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than ""Tipping Point"" in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 18 de maio de 2013

The main message is clear, there are extenuating circumstances in ever outcome in life.  He looks at how the month you were born in really affects your ability to play top notch hockey (it makes a big difference),  That in and of itself may not be a big issue for you, but, by inference it may influence when you try to have children and the impact on them scholastically.

Steve,5,Wonderful Book!,"Wow, what a book! Every minute I read ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" I was extremely engaged and intrigued. In ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, many patterns are analyzed as to why some people are more successful when compared to other people. Gladwell suggests that it is more than meets the eye; successful people are not only those who have the drive and will to be the best they can be, but successful people are born during the just the right time, giving them more opportunities than they would have if they were born just a year or two later. The examples Gladwell provides us with include how most of the greatest Canadian hockey players just happen to be born during a certain time of year, asserting that this is not just a coincidence but instead a pattern. He also explains why Korean pilots had more frequent plane crashes compared to pilots from other countries, why Asians are generally better than most at math, why Bill Gates was destined to excel in technological innovation and many other examples of outliers all over the world. Furthermore, it is evident that Gladwell did not simply formulate and write down his arguments within a day, instead, he put in the time to research the patterns he described, providing the readers with a plethora of statistics to verify his claims with. I believe that the read was even more exceptional for me since I started to make connections with these various patterns described throughout the book. In my case, I excel in school and many people believe that it is because I have a strong passion for doing as good as I can in school. While this may be true, I feel that there is a deeper explanation than what most people at my school see, just like how Gladwell thinks. I think that since my mom was a teacher for most of my childhood years, I had an advantage over my peers in school at a young age which has now transferred over to high school, allowing for my success.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 25 de setembro de 2017
Charles M. Davis,4,Fascinating look at what makes people successful...,"I really enjoyed the diverse fields and examples from which Gladwell draws to make his points.

Other obscure fields likely have several very successful people from widely diverse backgrounds.  Therefore, the central thesis of success being born out of support of others outside of yourself (family, culture, etc.) and opportunity seems correct.  Also, I like the 10,000-hour principle he refers to significantly throughout the book as another primary thesis.  A secondary thesis that success in a certain area will likely be able to tie back in to one very specific demographic is too narrowly supported and evident of confirmation bias.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 14 de janeiro de 2014

S. Maughan,3,**DANGEROUS** (But Rivetting)!!,"Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer.  You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories.  But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, ""who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut""?  The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point.  Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past.  You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which ""made them successful"".  Obama must have read Outlier before making his ""you didn't build your business"" speech.  And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous.  Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success.  Surely the successful need to ""share their success"".  Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals).

Gail Dohrmann,1,hypothesis contrary to fact,"The inclusion of charts, graphs, and lists in Outliers suggests that the book will be scientific in its attempt to show significant factors in  the roots or causes of success.  Closer examination reveals, however, that many fallacies in reasoning--for example, reasoning from anecdotes, metaphors, and correlations--throw his contentions into question or at least should make the reader question the significance of what he is saying. However the most egregious fallacy is ""hypothesis contrary to fact.""  Although used frequently in informal speech, this device which postulates what might be true if something else had not happened, proves nothing.  According to Gladwell, the Beatles would not have been famous if they hadn't had a 10 year period of practice, Bill Gates owes his success to having access to a computer lab when he was in school, the first officer of Korean Airlines plane could have landed the plane if he hadn't shown such deference to the pilot.

For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things.  However, I think if you put someone else in Bill Gates shoes, events would not be guaranteed to turn out the same just because that `someone else' was in place of Bill Gates luck and opportunity.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 19 de novembro de 2009

Dextra L. Suggs,5,"""Achievement is talent plus preparation""","As a Malcolm Gladwell fan, my review may be biased. But I find it hard to disagree with the premise of his book, Outliers. Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 12 de julho de 2009

Practicing a skill is important too (10,000 hours plus leads to mastery). We must also acknowledge our culture; do we believe in hard work, etc?

Gladwell provides numerous examples as to why our mindset is flawed and backs it up with irrefutable research from different fields.

Not only will it motivate you but it will refuel your persistence in the goal of ultimately achieving success.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 26 de janeiro de 2016
Wanda B. Red,4,Not itself an outlier,"""Outliers"" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the ""rags to riches"" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing ""the rest of the story,"" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 24 de julho de 2011

Brad Gustave,2,Overrated,"I feel like Gladwell presents an intriguing question, but he offers no control cases, except for the case of Mr. Langan. As a scientist, and someone who looks at statistics daily, I am underwhelmed by assigning validity to a phenomenon without having a control group against which to compare the results. Gladwell fails at this, and I feel he is making conclusions based on personal emotional attachment to his family's history. This book is less a complete concept and more a hypothesis with an incomplete examination of his thesis. This was more about an indictment of the haves, and an excuse for the have-nots to assign their locus of control to external forces, than it was an exploration of what makes the successful truly successful.

Psych Doc,5,A Book Well Worth Critical And Personal Attention,"This book is both well-written and eye opening.  I began reading, ""The Outliers,"" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging.  He was right.  Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our ""heroes"" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance.  In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary.  Having internalized this ""bootstrap"" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less ""worthy"" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts.  Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control.  These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 5 de setembro de 2011

Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the ""10,000 hour rule"" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field.

The 10,000 hours of practice required to become ""good"" at ANYTHING is a number I can support.  I have taught students from kindergarted through graduate school in college.

Qdaddy,5,Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers,"Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a ""self made man"". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 22 de fevereiro de 2012

Amol Nirgudkar,5,Outliers--Great observations and even greater inspiration,"For those who enjoyed ""The Tipping Point,"" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness.  In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world.  Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement.  Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of ""perfect timing"" working in your favor to make you successful.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 23 de março de 2012

Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein.

It makes you think about how life presents you opportunities and if you are willing to realize that is happening then the truth will not be with held from you.,Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 31 de março de 2016

Jenniferlynn,5,Great book from a different view point.,I really liked this book for the way it reframes the story of success.

Abel Morelos,5,Challenging conventional wisdom,"This book is about challenging many of the ideas or bias we have about successful people, in particular, the people considered to be ""outliers"". For example, a lot people and parents think that talent and hard work is everything you need to success, and they could be right until certain degree, but the truth is that real outliers achieve success because there a lot of other additional factors contributing to their success besides innate talent and hard work.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 4 de março de 2013
Dr. Larry,5,Excellent Book!,This book is very well written. Gladwell helps one to understand that there is more to success than just hard work and ability; it has a lot to do with being in the right time and place.

Beyond that this has amazing sociological studies and information about why people become great at something.  I don't even like to read very much and I am really enjoying this book.

R. Carboni,4,Interesting Facts,"The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful.  In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 27 de junho de 2009
Elliott Ingersoll,2,Speaking of outliers...,"What is it about Malcolm Gladwell's little 8.5""x5.5"" books that I find so annoying? Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own ""revelations"" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5"" x 5.5."" book.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 26 de maio de 2009

Did not have to agree with every conclusion to both learn and appreciate the author's thoughts.  Maybe that was because I have always felt that environment and timing were key attributes of success.

EYetz,5,A Self-Help Book You Can't Pass Up!,"Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is.

I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there.

Amazon Customer,5,Parent or Not to Parent,"Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself.  In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial  with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount.  One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself.  Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately.  I agree with the premise of the book to a point.  While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors.  By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my ""surroundings"" and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 13 de janeiro de 2017

The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened.  He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime.

V. Vital,5,Enjoyable and enlightening,"I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is well written and very thought provoking.  Meritocracy is an ingrained element of our society.  Gladwell attacks that notion, however, and does so in a very rational, methodical and well-supported fashion.  My summary of the book: luck + hard work + reasonable brain power + reasonable to high ""social"" intelligence = success.  The ""luck"" factor is what those living under the meritocracy myth like to overlook.  Who your parents are; when you were born; where you were born; where you live; etc. -- these things matter immensely.

When he does cite evidence such as research on musicians supporting the 10,000 hours of practice, then I find his claims much more compelling.

He cites a charter (?) school in NYC that was successful with children, but leaves out the drop out rate.  He wrote to make his point, he did not write to clarify anyone's thinking.

Yes, an amazing read, as already stated in numerous reviews here.  The stories that Gladwell provides are more than interesting.  Convincing, great food for thought.  The reader should recognize that many undercurrents influence and direct human activities, ambitions, and progress at macro and micro levels, more so in our faster-paced modern time.  I would have appreciated many more stories from Gladwell in this book, as it easily could have been a much larger book - and yet I still would have been glued to its pages.  (Admittedly, the latter chapters were not as captivating as the first 2/3rds of the book, but they still serve to strengthen the author's premise.)  For Gladwell, to add more stories, parallels, & content would have required possibly a lifetime more research.  This is now required reading for my children, as they approach a college education.

It debunks the convient myth that people we look at as successful or just born with it. That thinking lets some people feel comfortable with not being as successful as they could be. The bottomline is the book shows you why Bill Gates and a few other successful people are in effect successful. It was because of their life experiences, luck, and taking advantage of the opportunities given them.

A. Lowman,4,Fascinating and Insightful,"Outliers--like The Tipping Point and Blink before it--is a fascinating study of phenomena that we all observe but often fail to question and, therefore, do not completely understand.  Many authors provide the slew of data that he does, but without adequate illustration it is difficult to connect to their material.  Still others are great at incorporating anecdotes but do not provide adequate foundation for their conclusions.  Gladwell, however, masterfully combines research and anecdote in this examination of the factors that have shaped the success of everyone from star hockey players to industrial magnates to nuclear physicists to superstar lawyers.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 3 de janeiro de 2011

Brian Strauss,5,"Great book, fast read.","Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is a great book about the outliers of success. Gladwell discusses several things throughout the book that are direct factors to success, such as hard work, opportunities, and - believe it or not - your ethnicity. Talent by itself will not get you to where you want to be in life. Hard work by itself will not get you where you want to be in life. Opportunities by themselves will not get you where you want to be in life. But if you combine talent, a good work ethic, opportunities, and being born or growing up at the right time, can lead you to a very successful life. Gladwell discusses cases like Bill Gates, who only became the founder of Microsoft because of several lucky breaks in his life, one being that he lived just minutes away from Washington University, who happened to be giving out free computer hours during the early 70's.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 22 de fevereiro de 2012

It's not fair to say his information is unsupported, he does cite plenty of research to support his theories.  Anyone can be a cynic and claim that he is biased or that he is fake and catchy.  The real point is, it's inspiring.  Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity.  Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable.  I think it's a good estimate of the truth.  I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.

Many of the things in here are common sense. It just removes the wool from over your eyes that society likes to use to blind us to the simple truth. Gladwell disproves the myth that greatness is something we are born with and/or more genetic than skill. True greatness is not the birthright of the ""lucky"" few. Greatness is in fact the reward of those who work hard. I read this book at exactly the right time in my life and would suggest it to anyone.

Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point.  He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality.  The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 27 de setembro de 2009

How did Bill Gates become a billionaire? And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes.

DrD,4,Read this book. It's captivating and well written.,"Malcolm Gladwell does a very good job addressing some of the clearly misguided impressions of the modern culture that thinks someone who has been successful somehow stumbled onto the opportunity and got lucky. Well, ""Outliers - The Story of Success"" describes individuals who were in the right place, at the right time, and were prepared to take advantage of the opportunity presented to them. They weren't the blindly lucky...they were the ultimately prepared by thousands of hours of progressive learning and practice.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 13 de novembro de 2014

Linda,5,Survey Entrepreneur Class- book reading assignment review,"The Matthew effect showed that opportunity plays a critical role in success and suggests that the more successful you are you are given better opportunities. In the book Ericsson’s study concluded there were no natural musicians but rather people at the top work much harder. Just like the analogy of the relevance of height in basketball and levels of IQ there is a threshold that he found proved that it's the practice that separates those successful. Concerted cultivation showed me being prepared for the world and support is a critical variable and no one makes it alone. KIPP is a good example of succeeding by taking cultural legacies seriously, I hope my future children can participate in this.  I learned Asians have a simplistic numeric system give them an advantage,  to me this was a light bulb as to how important transparency is. Gladwell made me think outside the limits of my own understanding of other cultures especially with the efficient Chinese farmers. He also made me realize accumulation of errors in teamwork and communication can be catastrophic just like the plane crashes. Renee and the TIMSS students showed the importance of persistence. Going forward with the Baltimore study, I feel we can help teach parents from low income family that may currently let their children learn on their own to teach them to do educational activities in the summer would be prolific.

The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation.  If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too.  This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you.  It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.

It goes step by step explaining the importance of circumstance and luck (yes, luck!) as key role players in the lives of people who achieve (or don't) the kind of success that we normally attribute to just hard work and ingenuity. It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part.

These aren't just stories of success: the careful reader will find his own pathway to success.  Gladwell doesn't promise as much.  His publisher probably won't let him.

IJH,4,Definitely worth buying,"This was the first book I bought for my Kindle.  Reading the reviews, I was skeptical of the book initially - as I don't buy into the concept of ""secret to success"" as one fitting formula for the general masses.  But this book was different.  Malcolm Gladwell took his well-researched case studies and dissected the results and the processes to present a balanced look at some of the best known successful people of our times.  It was comforting to have his research confirm that success goes to people who really do work at it - although being at the right place, at the right time, and born to the right environment all help.  Just as I finished the book, I was speaking to one of my colleagues, as he described the trials and tribulations of raising a star hockey player in his family.  I asked him about his son's birthdate (March), and the practice times and opportunities that his son has had.  It was all there.  The making of a successful hockey player in Canada following the path that many NHL players before him. I recommended the book to my friend, and he was immediately fascinated.

Shannon J Bockstahler,4,"Incredibly interesting with many possibilities, but...","Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to ""make it big"" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to ""make it big."" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 21 de abril de 2011

Mei,5,Outliers -Bliss,"In the Opilogue to ""the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all"" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP ""[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously"" and ""bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city."" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, ""success is not exceptional or mysterious.""(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved ""a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 21 de junho de 2010

Shelley C.,5,Required Book Review for ENTR 300,"I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey Entrepreneurship course and that this was my recommended reading. The thing I liked most about this book is the emphasis on the 10,000 hour rule.  Gladwell feels that in order to perfect your craft, you must spend at least 10,000 hours working on the craft you have selected.  You can also see the influences of his family in his life.  His mother was of Jamaican descent, who was also a writer, and his father was a mathematician.  Gladwell feels that he was placed in a position of privilege stemming from his ancestry, because his family was taken from hard labor in slavery when the master took in his great great great great grandmother as a mistress.I think the book should have been longer with more to read (Ha Ha).  Gladwell also emphasizes that you do not have to be brilliant to be successful, because some of the most successful people seem to have been gifted or born with the knack for success.  Gladwell also lists a vast array of people who exemplify this theory, including Canadian hockey players, the Beatles, and Bill Gates. I am sure he selected the Canadian hockey players because he personally lived in Canada. He even talks about his own efforts at the 10,000 hour rule, and how he personally accomplished this while working as a journalist at The American Spectator and The Washington Post.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for motivation for success, even though this book was assigned and not read by choice.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 8 de março de 2015

Andrea T. Goeglein,5,An Outliers' Tipping Point,"Why this book matters:  I recently had the privilege of witnessing a great act of philanthropy supported by the message in Outliers.  When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and ""greening"" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell.  Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience.  Many books are a great read.  How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come?  To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance.  Well written book, well researched, and inspiring others to greatness.  Don't blink Malcolm, you have created a tipping point.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 13 de agosto de 2009

Sampah,1,Unconvincing and overly long.,"I really wanted to enjoy this - having just finished ""Blink"" and liking it. But I found myself unconvinced by most of the claims and conclusions and even the logic of the arguments. Right from chapter one where the author asserts that the Beatles rose to the top because of the amount of time they spent playing together, especially in Hamburg, before they started having hits. It is easy to write that but it is not a fact - it's an unprovable opinion. A number of things contributed to the Beatles success - two very distinctive lead singers and, mostly some amazing songwriting and arranging. The long hours spent playing together would definitely make them a tight performing group and help develop their musicianship but those are not the things that made them famous. They were very competent musicians but certainly not in the top league of instrumentalists (the solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was played by Eric Clapton, for example). The Beatles did not change the face of pop music until they stopped performing and became a studio band - on Revolver they moved on from playing three chord love songs and started experimenting musically.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 29 de abril de 2010

Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me.

Gladwell, shows his findings and theory of what he thinks actually constitutes the success of greats like Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and others from a lens that though might seem obvious is many times ignored due to the common notion and praise we give to achieving things from individual merit. With the use of his title, “Outliers,” he provides an outline, or better yet a lens, into what makes outliers—outstanding individuals, or something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body—successful in the end. What many used to and still can argue is due to true talent and hard work, may be caused by a random array of circumstances that if taken advantage of are the true propeller towards success.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 6 de maio de 2015

brother tim,5,developing a new worldview,"gladwell destroys the concept of inherent abilities. as a black man this is important because we have been told for 400 years that we are genetically inferior in intelligence. Gladwell's study indicates that the intelligence factor plays far less a role than many other factors such as time spent on a skill, education, and one's cultural environment. his work is going to have a tremendous effect on the education of children. it will also lead many parents to place more emphasis on intervening in their children's development, especially in having them learn special skills at an early age. we know that tiger woods began playing golf as a toddler. parents will begin taking this concept more seriously than before. black parents will also begin to understand the relationship of culture to their worldview and resultant behavior, especially what they are teaching their children on a subliminal level. it is very critical reading for those of us who live in the black communities of america. this book will spawn tremendous activity and research.many more books will be written because of it.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 10 de março de 2010

Parrish Moss,5,For Entrepreneurs,"I’m a student at University of Baltimore and I am in enrolled in an Entrepreneurship course.  To summarize the book, Outliers takes you through a serious of account and stories to explain how successful people become successful. The first part of the book explains that successful people are successful because of the opportunities they are granted. This allows them to be able to hone their craft, or depending on the era they were born, gives them a chance to capitalize in certain situations. The second part of the book talks about legacy and how depending on your culture, shapes the person you’ll become. What I love about this book, is how it explains how to become successful through the use of inspiring accounts from the lives of people who just like me had or have an ordinary life. In most cases, it’s hard to explain and gives steps on how to be successful because many believe it’s based on luck. However, Gladwell proves that success is almost calculated and mapped out based on the time of several attributes such as your cultural background or opportunities. However, some of his accounts like basing the hockey player’s age as the reason as to why most are successful is farfetched in my opinion. For entrepreneur students, it teaches them to dismiss the fact that being successful is just luck or a random occurrence. Entrepreneur students reading this book learn that success is all based on how you position yourself and the opportunities you decide to take.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 4 de março de 2015

Reeper,1,The Myth of Productivity,"Gladwell points out some very important factors to increase productivity as a laborer and to be more competitive in an economy that favors employers: Education, Hard Work, Funding, Connections and a little luck.  These are especially important in a declining economy, but their importance is attenuated in a growing economy. As demand for laborers exceeds the labor supply, opportunity is created for everyone, not just the most productive and competitive.  This is the fundamental point that Gladwell does not understand.  He never asks the important questions:  What is causing the demand for labor to decrease?  What is causing a reduction in the supply of jobs?  What is causing economic decline? Why don't we change what is causing demand for labor to decrease instead of increasing the labor supply?  And this is my ""genuine misgiving"" with Gladwell's ""glorious misconception."" Still, the reality is that the economy is in decline and laborers will have to become more competitive in order to gain the diminishing number of jobs available in the market. I think Gladwell does a good job providing psycho-analytical reasons for accepting and persisting in the grind of life as it becomes more grueling and for accepting failure as the result of bad luck. More capital consumption in order to grow and make more competitive the labor supply is not a long term solution.  Increasing the labor pool does not equate to increasing the job pool.  It is not opportunity in real terms.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 16 de julho de 2013

Yes, Gladwell does say that his ""outliers"" like Bill Gates and Bill Joy had extraordinary opportunities and luck that other people didn't have; but none of that opportunity and luck would have done them any good if they hadn't been willing to work very long hours at programming, in order to become the best programmers in the world.

What annoys me is that some people now quote that FALSE STATEMENT as though it were gospel. It's NOT! Oh well, there are also other major errors in Gladwells books, but he IS entertaining. And it wouldn't hurt if he lost that ""absent minded professor"" look! He could tuck his shirt in (or leave it out). Not half-in half-out...before a giving a talk at TED.

Lindsey E. Willis,3,Not as good as his other works,I enjoyed Blink and Tipping Point but I felt Outliers read like it was put together on short notice.

It was still somewhat interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for it again. Pick it up used.,Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 16 de setembro de 2009

Neodoering,5,"Yes, Society is Screwing You; Find Out Just How Bad It Is","This was an utterly fascinating book about the secret factors that contribute to individual success.  We are told to be smart, savvy and take advantage of opportunities, but factors like what time of year you're born, what decade you're born in, the circumstances of your education, and other factors beyond our control have a great deal to do with how successful we can become.  This will amaze you, and if you're thinking about it, you'll get mad at how your circumstances determine who you can become.  After a certain point you'll read this book for pointers on how to screw the system that is screwing you.  The discouraging thing is that virtually no one makes it who has not worked hard and done their homework, but most people will be stopped hard by factors they can do nothing about.  I have read several Malcolm Gladwell books and have been consistently pleased by the numerous examples and behind-the-scenes exposes that he consistently highlights.  You have long suspected that society is a rigged game, but the extent to which society is jerking you around must be seen to be believed.

Neil Smit,2,"Outliers, the story of ""you won't make it""","I found this book a pleasure to read as a great source of history and drawing conclusions to what makes a successful person. Summarizing the traits and upbringing of many successful people in history is indeed an interesting read. However, the book left me somewhat disappointed, almost as if it were trying to say: ""Sorry, you are not from the right country, birth date, race, parental and family background to ever be successful in this age.""  After all the reviews and mentions of work partners and public speakers, I expected feeling more liberated rather than marginalized after reading this book. Maybe a re-read in the future might change my perspective.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 21 de abril de 2015

Malcolm Gladwell is a master storyteller who weaves an astonishing tapestry from case examples in sports, technology, manufacturing, education, and other arenas to support his premise. Outliers is fascinating as a sociological map of those we might consider geniuses, but we learn that the true geniuses may be still on the farm, because their circumstances never provided the fertile soil of life situations to propel them to their full potential. Likewise, there are those whose heritage interfered and set the stage for tragedy. Most striking is that you only need to be smart enough, not a genius, to excel.

The main thing is that the author never quite explains the meaning, reason or route to success.  The author give you the feeling that there is no rhyme or reason for anything, that it is all chance.

M. Hilton,1,Gladwell is over-rated,"After reading all three of Gladwell's books (Tipping Point, Blink, and Outlier), I have pretty much figured out his formula.  Glackwell is half black as well as a Canadian.  Basically, he writes about things that would normally be politically incorrect for a white person to write about.  For example, according to Gladwell, Asians are good at math because they come from a culture of growing rice.  He does this from behind the ""shield"" of being half black, so of course he can't possibly be implying anything racist or ethnocentric.  In addition, Gladwell has a very obvious ideology that he is espousing - essentially that of a political liberal who believes that the individual is less important than the culture he comes from or the lucky advantages the individual enjoys.  In other words, the important thing is the collective.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 12 de janeiro de 2009
Andrew S. Cofrin,4,What It Takes To Make It,"Outliers is a sociological study which brings sense to a confusing world. We've always been told, often with ""up from the bootstraps"" Alger allegories, that it takes hard work, smarts, and determination to be a success. However, things like family background and socio-economic status really do matter. Even plain old luck, such as where and when you were born, can make a huge difference. Measured IQ may afford an advantage, but only to a point. Those intent on the big prize must perfect their craft over the course of 10,000 hours, just as Bill Gates, the Beatles, and Michael Jordan did.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 17 de maio de 2011

"Ron G. Cheek, PhD",1,Stating the Obvious - Missing the Outliers,"Since the publication of the ""Tipping Point"" I have used Gladwell's book in many of my lectures and required reading for graduate students. Yet just as I was delighted with that work, I was equally disappointed with ""Outliers."" His findings stated the obvious.  Parental support combined with opportunity/chance provides the landscape for amazing success stories.  Are these outliers or merely the results of strong parental support? Certainly culture, environment, and other variables combined play a role in success.  It would seem that the true outliers would be those that came from lower income families. These families were concerned with economic survival that no time was available to support the educational needs of their children.  When children from this background and despite the odds achieved success, they would truly be the outliers. From the perspective of ""Outliers"" we shouldn't waste any time whatsoever with them, they can't possibly succeed!",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 8 de dezembro de 2008

nona sark,2,Phylosophicaly Dated & Scued.,"So, I just read chapter 9 from Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. The title is, Marita's Bargain. The context is a Bronx school program called KIPP and inner city disadvantaged kids. The disadvantage being, middle class parents building up their kids during the summer break while poor kids just languish over the summer doing nothing. He upset me when he said, ""It is not the brightest who succeed, If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is rather, a gift."" Got that folks, we are not in charge of our own destiny. You didn't build any thing you think you worked hard for. I just lost total respect for this mans writing abilities, which I might add, he's just lucky he has. He even goes as far as saying, anyone of us could be in Bill Gate's shoes and accomplished the same thing given the same scenario. What a crock.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 14 de novembro de 2012

W. Adams,1,McSuccess,"This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists.  However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful.  I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations.  After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A.  Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause.  Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era.  Duhhhh. What makes his ""research"" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation.  For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable.  In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion?  Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 26 de outubro de 2009

He rightly notes that while IQ is certainly a contributor, it reaches a ""point of diminishing returns"" after a while: once people score about 130, IQ becomes less important and ""intangibles"" (my term) become more important.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 20 de março de 2009

Wendy Wester,1,I would have loved this book IF I EVER RECEIVED IT !!,"I was looking forward to reading Outliers by Gladwell.  Unfortunately, I never received the book and my emails to the seller remain unanswered to this day.  I will never order from these sellers again and have lost my trust to a great extent in Amazon.  So, be warned, future book shoppers!  If you really want to read a book, the library might be a more reliable, faster and less expensive choice.  I gave it one star because I couldn't post my review unless I gave it one.",Avaliado nos Estados Unidos em 24 de fevereiro de 2010
