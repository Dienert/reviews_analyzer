Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily.

It\\'s never boring, not a word wasted but is worth the price of purchase alone for the chapter titled \"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\", which is about as stunning a chapter as I\\'ve read in non-fiction.
